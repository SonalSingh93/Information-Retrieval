rocket launch  wikipedia a rocket launch is the takeoff phase of the flight of a rocket launches for orbital spaceflights or launches into interplanetary space are usually from a fixed location on the ground but may also be from a floating platform or from an airplanelaunches of suborbital flights including missile launches can also be fromlaunches not into space can also be froma skyrocket is launched from some standrocket launch technologies generally refers to the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle not just the vehicle itself but also the firing control systems ground control station launch pad and tracking stations needed for a successful launch andor recoverycommercial launch service providers includeif a rocket is launched to deliver a payload from a planetary surface into space it is called a launch vehiclethere are several broad categories that launch vehicles fall under includingfor the launch vehicles currently in use for human spaceflight see that article there were over 70 orbital launches in 2010orbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically and then begin to progressively lean over usually following a gravity turn trajectoryonce above the majority of the atmosphere the vehicle then angles the rocket jet pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed as the speed grows the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed the engine will cut offall current vehicles stage that is jettison hardware on the way to orbit although vehicles have been proposed which would be able to reach orbit without staging none have ever been constructed and the exponentially increasing fuel requirements of such a vehicle would make its useful payload tiny or nonexistent most current and historical launch vehicles expend their jettisoned hardware typically by allowing it to crash into the ocean but some have recovered and reused jettisoned hardware either by parachute or by propulsive landing when launching a spacecraft to orbit a dogleg is a guided powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rockets flight path to deviate from a straight path a dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth to reach a desired orbital inclination would take the ground track over land or over a populated area eg russia usually does launch over land but over unpopulated areas or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the latitude of the launch site doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required causing heavier load and a reduction of vehicle performance
