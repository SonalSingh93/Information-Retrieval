was the fourth named storm second hurricane and first major hurricane of the season in july the hurricane set several records for early season hurricane activity becoming the strongest atlantic hurricane ever to form before august a title it held for only six days before being surpassed by hurricane emilydennis hit cuba twice as a category4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale and made landfall on the florida panhandle in the united states as a category3 storm less than a year after hurricane ivan did so dennis killed 88 people76directly and 12indirectlyin the us and caribbean and caused 2.23billion 2005usd in damages to the united states as well as an approximately equal amount of damage in the caribbean primarily on cubathe incipient tropical wave that became dennis was identified on june26 2005 well-inland over africa it later emerged over the atlantic ocean on june29 and moved briskly to the west dry air initially inhibited development though once this abated the wave was able to consolidate into a tropical depression on july4 the depression soon crossed grenada before entering the caribbean sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors such as low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures fueled intensification turning west-northwest the system achieved tropical storm status on july5 and hurricane status the following day formation of a well-defined eye and central dense overcast signaled denniss intensification into a major hurricane on july7 throughout this phase the hurricane traversed the jamaica channel bringing deadly floods to both jamaica and haitithe powerful storm soon struck granma province cuba as a category4 early on july8 violent winds battered the province and caused extensive damage briefly weakening due to interaction with land dennis quickly regained its strength paralleling the western coast of cuba dennis attained its peak winds of 150mph 240kmh later that day before making a second landfall in the country this time in matanzas province resumed interaction with the mountains of cuba caused significant weakening however once dennis emerged over the gulf of mexico on july9 it was able to quickly reorganize the hurricane reached category4 strength for a third time on july10 as it approached florida attaining its lowest barometric pressure of 930mbar hpa 27.46inhg this ranked dennis as the strongest pre-august hurricane in the atlantic basin however this was eclipsed just six days later by hurricane emily which was the first july category5 on record weakening ensued as the hurricane approached the florida panhandle ultimately making landfall over santa rosa island on july10 as a category3 dramatic weakening ensued once the cyclone moved ashore dennis lingered as a tropical depression and remnant low for roughly a week traversing the mississippi river valley and ohio river valley before finally dissipating over ontario on july18in haiti officials evacuated residents

damage to the communications infrastructure had occurred dennis was more destructive than the previous years hurricane charley and was widely regarded as the worst hurricane to strike cuba since hurricane flora in the 1963 seasonin the united states damage was not as high as originally expected mainly because dennis was more compact and moved more quickly than initially forecast dennis made landfall approximately 30 miles 48km to the east of where hurricane ivan had made landfall 10months before but did not cause as much damage as ivan due to its quicker speed compact size and because the area was not fully rebuilt dennis moved about 7mph 11kmh faster than ivan at landfall and had hurricane-force winds that only extended 40miles 65km from its center compared to ivans 105miles 170kmh during the height of the storm dennis produced storm surges as high as 9ft 3m in the apalachee bay region and as high as 7ft 2m on the florida panhandle and left 680,000 customers without
