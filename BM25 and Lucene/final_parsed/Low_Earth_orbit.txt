low earth orbit  wikipedia a low earth orbit leo is an orbit around earth with an altitude of 2,000 kilometres 1,200mi or less and an orbital period of between about 84 and 127 minutes objects below approximately 160 kilometres 99mi will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss due to atmospheric dragwith the exception of the 24 astronauts who flew lunar flights in the apollo program during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972 all human spaceflights have taken place in leo or below the international space station conducts operations in leo the altitude record for a human spaceflight in leo was gemini 11 with an apogee of 1,374.1 kilometres 853.8mi all crewed space stations to date as well as the majority of satellites have been in leoobjects in leo encounter atmospheric drag from gases in the thermosphere approximately 80500km up or exosphere approximately 500km and up depending on orbit height due to atmospheric drag satellites do not usually orbit below 300km objects in leo orbit earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner van allen radiation beltgoce orbited at about 255 km and had an aerodynamic shape and ion thrusters to reduce and compensate for atmospheric dragthe mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low earth orbit is about 7.8kms but reduces with increased orbital altitude calculated for circular orbit of 200km it is 7.79kms and for 1500km it is 7.12kms the delta-v needed to achieve low earth orbit starts around 9.4kms atmospheric and gravity drag associated with launch typically adds 1.31.8kms to the launch vehicle delta-v required to reach normal leo orbital velocity of around 7.8kms 28,080kmhequatorial low earth orbits eleo are a subset of leo these orbits with low inclination to the equator allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest delta-v requirement ie fuel spend of any orbit orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called polar orbitshigher orbits include medium earth orbit meo sometimes called intermediate circular orbit ico and further above geostationary orbit geo orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulationalthough the earths pull due to gravity in leo is not much less than on the surface of the earth people and objects in orbit experience weightlessness because they are in free falla low earth orbit is simplest and cheapest for satellite placement it provides high bandwidth and low communication time lag latency but satellites in leo will not be visible from any given point on the earth at all timesthe leo environment is becoming congested with space debris due to the frequency of object launches this has caused growing concern in recent years since collisions at orbital velocities can easily be dangerous and even deadly collisions can produce even more space debris in the process creating a domino effect something known as kessler syndrome the joint space operations center part of united states strategic command formerly the united states space command currently tracks more than 8,500 objects larger than 10cm in leo however a limited arecibo observatory study suggested there could be approximately one million objects larger than 2 millimeters which are too small to be visible from earth-based observatoriesthis article incorporatespublic domain material from websites or documents of the national aeronautics and space administration
