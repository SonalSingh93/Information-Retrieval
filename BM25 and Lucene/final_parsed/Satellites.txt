satellite  wikipedia in context of spaceflight a satellite is an artificial object which has been intentionally placed into orbit such objects are sometimes called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as earths moonin 1957 the soviet union launched the worlds first artificial satellite sputnik 1 since then about 6,600 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched according to a 2013 estimate 3,600 remained in orbit of those about 1,000 were operational while the rest have lived out their useful lives and became space debris approximately 500 operational satellites are in low-earth orbit 50 are in medium-earth orbit at 20,000km and the rest are in geostationary orbit at 36,000km a few large satellites have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites to the moon mercury venus mars jupiter saturn a few asteroids and the sunsatellites are used for many purposes common types include military and civilian earth observation satellites communications satellites navigation satellites weather satellites and space telescopes space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites satellite orbits vary greatly depending on the purpose of the satellite and are classified in a number of ways well-known overlapping classes include low earth orbit polar orbit and geostationary orbita launch vehicle is a rocket that throws a satellite into orbit usually it lifts off from a launch pad on land some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform or aboard a plane see air launch to orbitsatellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems satellite subsystems attend many tasks such as power generation thermal control telemetry attitude control and orbit controlnewtons cannonball presented as a thought experiment in a treatise of the system of the world by isaac newton was the first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellitethe first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by edward everett hale the brick moon the idea surfaced again in jules vernes the begums fortune 1879in 1903 konstantin tsiolkovsky 18571935 published exploring space using jet propulsion devices in russian      which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft he calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit and that a multi-stage rocket fuelled by liquid propellants could achieve thisin 1928 herman potonik 18921929 published his sole book the problem of space travel  the rocket motor german das problem der befahrung des weltraums  der raketen-motor he described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experimentsin a 1945 wireless world article the english science fiction writer arthur c clarke 19172008 described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications he suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planetthe us military studied the idea of what was referred to as the earth satellite vehicle when secretary of defense james forrestal made a public announcement on 29 december 1948 that his office was coordinating that project between the various servicesthe first artificial satellite was sputnik 1 launched by the soviet union on 4 october 1957 and initiating the soviet sputnik program with sergei korolev as chief designer this in turn triggered the space race between the soviet union and the united statessputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere the unanticipated announcement of sputnik 1's success precipitated the sputnik crisis in the united states and ignited the so-called space race within the cold warsputnik 2 was launched on 3 november 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit a dog named laikain may 1946 project rand had released the preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship which stated a satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the twentieth century the united states had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the bureau of aeronautics of the united states navy the united states air forces project rand eventually released the report but considered the satellite to be a tool for science politics and propaganda rather than a potential military weapon in 1954 the secretary of defense stated i know of no american satellite program in february 1954 project rand released scientific uses for a satellite vehicle written by rr carhart this expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in june 1955 with the scientific use of an artificial satellite by hk kallmann and ww kelloggin the context of activities planned for the international geophysical year 195758 the white house announced on 29 july 1955 that the us intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958 this became known as project vanguard on 31 july the soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957following pressure by the american rocket society the national science foundation and the international geophysical year military interest picked up and in early 1955 the army and navy were working on project orbiter two competing programs the armys which involved using a jupiter c rocket and the civiliannavy vanguard rocket to launch a satellite at first they failed initial preference was given to the vanguard program whose first attempt at orbiting a satellite resulted in the explosion of the launch vehicle on national television but finally three months after sputnik 2 the project succeeded explorer 1 became the united states first artificial satellite on 31 january 1958in june 1961 three-and-a-half years after the launch of sputnik 1 the air force used resources of the united states space surveillance network to catalog 115 earth-orbiting satellitesearly satellites were constructed as one-off designs with growth in geosynchronous geo satellite communication multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses the first standardized satellite bus design was the hs-333 geo commsat launched in 1972the largest artificial satellite currently orbiting the earth is the international space stationthe united states space surveillance network ssn a division of the united states strategic command has been tracking objects in earths orbit since 1957 when the soviet union opened the space age with the launch of sputnik i since then the ssn has tracked more than 26,000 objects the ssn currently tracks more than 8,000 man-made orbiting objects the rest have re-entered earths atmosphere and disintegrated or survived re-entry and impacted the earth the ssn tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger those now orbiting earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds about seven percent are operational satellites ie 560 satellites the rest are space debris the united states strategic command is primarily interested in the active satellites but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missilesthere are three basic categories of non-military satellite servicesfixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice data and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the earths surfacemobile satellite systems help connect remote regions vehicles ships people and aircraft to other parts of the world andor other mobile or stationary communications units in addition to serving as navigation systemsscientific research satellites provide meteorological information land survey data eg remote sensing amateur ham radio and other different scientific research applications such as earth science marine science and atmospheric researchthe first satellite sputnik 1 was put into orbit around earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit by far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,459 artificial satellites orbiting the earth geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude inclination and eccentricitythe commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are low earth orbit leo medium earth orbit meo and high earth orbit heo low earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km medium earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786km high earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786kmthe general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial linksthe satellites functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics looking at the anatomy of a typical satellite one discovers two modules note that some novel architectural concepts such as fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomythe bus module consists of the following subsystemsthe structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damagethe telemetry subsystem aka command and data handling cdh monitors the on-board equipment operations transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station and receives the earth control stations commands to perform equipment operation adjustmentsthe power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power regulation and distribution functions and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the earths shadow nuclear power sources radioisotope thermoelectric generator have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the nimbus program 19641978the thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellites body eg optical solar reflectorthe attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation control laws embedded in the flight software and actuators reaction wheels thrusters these apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude keep the satellite in the correct orbital position and keep antennas pointed in the right directionsthe second major module is the communication payload which is made up of transponders a transponder is capable ofwhen satellites reach the end of their mission this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit historically due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited one example of this practice is the satellite vanguard 1 launched in 1958 vanguard 1 the 4th manmade satellite put in geocentric orbit was still in orbit as of august 2009instead of being de-orbited most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit as of 2002 the fcc requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch in cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting the major variable is the solar flux and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself and the gravitational perturbations generated by the sun and the moon as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges whether above or below sea level the nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78km with a range between 72 and 84km solar panels however are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95kmthis list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit including production of the necessary launch vehicle note many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them instead relying on foreign launch services this list does not consider those numerous countries but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously and the date this capability was first demonstrated the list includes the european space agency a multi-national state organization but does not include private consortiumsa few other private companies are capable of sub-orbital launcheswhile canada was the third country to build a satellite which was launched into space it was launched aboard an american rocket from an american spaceport the same goes for australia who launched first satellite involved a donated us redstone rocket and american support staff as well as a joint launch facility with the united kingdom the first italian satellite san marco 1 launched on 15 december 1964 on a us scout rocket from wallops island virginia united states with an italian launch team trained by nasa by similar occasions almost all further first national satellites was launched by foreign rockets-note both chile and belarus used russian companies as principal contractors to build their satellites they used russian-ukrainian manufactured rockets and launched either from russia or kazakhstanin recent times satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networksfor testing purposes satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth russia the united states and china have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites in 2007 the chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite followed by the us navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in february 2008due to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitters range gps satellites are potential targets for jamming but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jammingalso it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellites transponder it is common for earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space and dual-illuminate the transponder rendering the frequency unusable satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively
