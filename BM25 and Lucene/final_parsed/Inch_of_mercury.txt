inch of mercury  wikipedia inch of mercury inhg and hg is a unit of measurement for pressure it is still used for barometric pressure in weather reports refrigeration and aviation in the united statesit is the pressure exerted by a column of mercury of 1 inch 25.4mm in height at the standard acceleration of gravity conversion to metric units depends on the temperature of mercury and hence its density typical conversion factors areaircraft altimeters measure the relative pressure difference between the lower ambient pressure at altitude and a calibrated reading on the ground within the united states and canada these readings are provided in inches of mercury ground readings vary with weather and along the route of the aircraft as it travels so current readings are relayed periodically by air traffic control aircraft operating at higher altitudes at or above what is called the transition altitude which varies by country set their barometric altimeters to a standard pressure of 29.92inhg 1atm  29.92inhg or 1013.25hpa 1hpa  1mbar regardless of the actual sea level pressure the resulting altimeter readings are known as flight levelspiston engine aircraft with constant-speed propellers also use inches of mercury to measure manifold pressure which is indicative of engine power produced in automobile racing particularly united states auto club and champ car indy car racing inches of mercury was the unit used to measure turbocharger inlet pressure however the inch of mercury is still used today in car performance modification to measure the amount of vacuum within the engines intake manifold this can be seen on boostvacuum gaugesin air conditioning and refrigeration inhg is often used to describe inches of mercury vacuum or pressures below ambient atmospheric pressure for recovery of refrigerants from air conditioning and refrigeration systems as well as for leak testing of systems while under a vacuum and for dehydration of refrigeration systems the low-side gauge in a refrigeration gauge manifold indicates pressures below ambient in inches of mercury vacuum inhg down to a 30inhg vacuuminches of mercury is also used in automotive cooling system vacuum test and fill tools a technician will use this tool to remove air from modern automotive cooling systems test the systems ability to hold vacuum and subsequently refill using the vacuum as suction for the new coolant typical minimum vacuum values are between 22 and 27inhgin older literature an inch of mercury is based on the height of a column of mercury at 60f 15.6c in english units 1inhg60f  0.489 771psi or 2.041 771inhg60f  1psi
