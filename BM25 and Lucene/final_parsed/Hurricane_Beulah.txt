hurricane beulah  wikipedia hurricane beulah was the second tropical storm second hurricane and only major hurricane during the 1967 atlantic hurricane season it tracked through the caribbean struck the yucatn peninsula of mexico as a major hurricane and moved west-northwest into the gulf of mexico briefly gaining category 5 intensity it was the strongest hurricane during the 1967 atlantic hurricane season the hurricane made landfall just north of the mouth of the rio grande river as a category3 it spawned 115 tornadoes across texas which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a tropical cyclone due to its slow movement over texas beulah led to significant flooding at the time beulah ranked as the second-costliest hurricane on record having left roughly 1billion 1967 usd in damage only hurricane betsy two years prior had caused such considerable losses throughout its path at least 59 people were killedon august22 1967 an essa-5 satellite image depicted an area of enhanced convectionshower and thunderstorm activityeast of the western high plateau in cameroon over central africa reaching the western slopes of the mountains two days later the tropical wave became more coherent with clouds condensing along its axis as it moved over west africa cyclonic rotation became apparent about 2,000ft 610m above the surface a research paper published in 1969 refers to the disturbance as a depression as it neared the west coast of africa however this significantly differs from the official atlantic hurricane database which does not mention the system at that time as a surface circulation likely did not exist regardless the system emerged over the atlantic ocean around 12n on august28 as represented by barometric pressure falls in dakar senegal once over water the system interacted with the intertropical convergence zone and continued westward along an undulating path with no further organization it was not until a united states navy weather reconnaissance plane flew into the disturbance on september4 while it was located east of the lesser antilles that signs of development were apparent corresponding observations from ships in the region on september5 confirmed the existence of a 1010mbar hpa 28.23inhg low-pressure area in light of this the disturbance was classified as a tropical depression at 12:00utc that day with its center situated roughly 175mi 285km east-northeast of barbadosa slow-moving system the depression steadily organized as it approached the lesser antilles observations from aircraft reconnaissance indicated that the system attained gale-force winds by 12:00utc on september7 resulting in its upgrade to a tropical storm it was also assigned the name beulah making it the second named storm of the 1967 season shortly after being named beulah clipped the southern coast of martinique and entered the eastern caribbean sea feeding off the warm waters of the caribbean the cyclone quickly strengthened and reached hurricane intensity by 18:00utc on september8 rapid deepening ensued thereafter with the storms central pressure falling to 940mbar hpa 27.75inhg the following day as it passed 100mi 160km south of puerto rico at this time winds were estimated to be at least 140mph 225kmh ranking beulah as a category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale upon reaching this strength weather radar imagery from san juan puerto rico showed that beulah featured a 15mi 24km wide eye surrounded by an intense eyewall about 8mi 13km thickduring the evening of september9 beulah turned westward as weak ridge developed over the bahamas between it and the newly formed tropical storm doria the powerful storm weakened somewhat as an eyewall replacement cycle began to take shape during this phase the inner-eye of beulah contracted to roughly 34mi 56km in diameter while a second eyewall spanned an area 28mi 45km across the smaller eye soon dissipated and the larger one became the single dominant feature by the morning of september10 the completion of this marked the first time that an eyewall replacement cycle was observed in its entirety the aforementioned westward turn placed the dominican republic in the line of danger an area still reeling from the devastating effects of hurricane inez just one year prior fortunately the storm unexpectedly collapsed as it approached the barahona peninsula and struck the area as a greatly weakened though still significant hurricane with estimated winds of 90mph 150kmh around 18:00utc on september11skirting the southern coast of haitis tiburon peninsula beulah further degraded to a tropical storm by the morning of september12 unseasonably strong wind shear associated with the jet stream resulting from an upper-level trough to the north and the cyclones interaction with land were responsible for the dramatic degradation by the time it had cleared haiti beulah was no more than a minimal tropical storm with winds near 40mph 65kmh its pressure had also risen by roughly 60mbar hpa 1.77inhg to 1000mbar hpa 29.53inhg originally seen as a threat to jamaica northeasterly flow induced a southerly component to the track and pushed the cyclone south of the island on september13 the shear previously impeding organization abated on september14 and a ridge re-established itself to beulahs north allowing the storm to resume a west-northwest to northwest track the upper-level changes led to a favorable environment for intensification and beulah regained hurricane strength by 12:00utc on september14 while located about 425mi 685km south-southeast of havana cubamoving through the climatologically favorable western caribbean beulah quickly regained major hurricane status on september15 with winds estimated at 115mph 185kmh the storms pressure fell to 964mb hpa 28.47inhg on september16 before some weakening took place beulah ultimately made landfall on cozumel island with winds of at least 100mph 160kmh later that day and struck the mainland yucatn peninsula hours later despite moving over land little weakening took place by the time the hurricane emerged over the gulf of mexico about 24hours later the hurricane maintained its intensity throughout september18 as it moved west-northwest to southern tamaulipas mexico however on september19 a pronounced phase of rapid intensification took place as beulah turned northwest to the rio grande valley region aircraft reconnaissance throughout the day found falling pressures and ultimately measured a value of 923mbar hpa 27.25inhg around 18:00utc this was the second-lowest pressure ever recorded by aircraft at the time behind a 920mbar hpa 27.17inhg measurement in hurricane hattie of 1961 beulah was estimated to have achieved its peak intensity shortly thereafter as a category5 hurricane with winds estimated at 160mph 260kmhregarded as the third-largest hurricane on record at the time beulah moved along a slowing erratic and somewhat cycloidal path slight weakening ensued as it neared land and beulah ultimately made its final landfall south of brownsville texas near the mouth of the rio grande river around 13:00utc on september20 no direct measurements exist at the core of the hurricane as it moved ashore however based on a minimum pressure of 951mbar hpa 28.09inhg in brownsville the hurricane likely struck land at an intensity below that value a vessel anchored in the port of brownsville measured peak wind gusts of 136mph 219kmh equivalent to a low-end category4 hurricane according to the national hurricane center beulah struck as a category3 and had a pressure of 950mbar hpa 28.05inhg though a conclusive estimate awaits re-evaluation as part of the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project once over land the hurricane slowly weakened as it remained relatively close to the coast winds dropped below hurricane-force on september21 roughly 24hours after landfall the system subsequently stalled near alice texas before turning to the southwest after diminishing to a tropical depression late on september22 beulahs circulation finally dissipated over the mountainous terrain of nuevo len mexicofollowing beulahs rapid intensification on september9 a hurricane watch was issued for the whole of hispaniola on september9 with emphasis on a threat to the southern coast warnings were soon raised for areas between barahona and cabo engao in the dominican republicacross the dominican republic an estimated 200,000people evacuated from coastal areasbeginning on the afternoon of september 17 people were advised to remain off the beaches of padre mustang and st joseph islands immediate evacuation of port aransas and mustang padre and st joseph islands was advised on the morning of september 19 most residents and others on the islands evacuated including the personnel of padre island national seashore about 40 persons remained on the islands including about 20 at port aransas immediate evacuation of rockport and live oak and lamar peninsulas was advised in the evening of september 19 these areas and the towns of ingleside and aransas pass were nearly completely evacuated about 50 persons remained in rockport the evacuation of the university of corpus christi was advised on the morning of september 20 and corpus christi beach and parts of flour bluff were also evacuated during the storm there were 30,000people in shelters in nueces and san patricio counties including 6,000 in corpus christiin the days preceding beulah a stationary trough over the lesser antilles produced several days of heavy rain and set the stage for significant flooding on september7 beulah brought torrential rains to the already saturated region with reports of more than 10in 250mm received by the weather bureau hardest hit were the french west indies especially martinique during an 18hour span 11.85in 301mm fell on the island severe flooding claimed 15lives on martinique and destroyed many homes parts of fort-de-france were inundated by 3ft 0.91m of water while the martinique international airport saw 1ft 0.30m of flooding the banana crop sustained extensive losses across the island nearly 1,000residents were left homeless including 400 in fort-de-france damage on the island amounted to 4.5million supplies of fresh water were severely limited for two days following the stormheavy rains triggered flooding and landslides across st vincent blocking numerous roads and causing some damage two children were killed after a boulder dislodged by the rains crashed into their home damage on st lucia reached 3million mainly stemming from the banana crop which was largely ruined the periphery of the hurricane brought rainfall primarily to southwestern puerto rico where a maximum of 9.76 inches 248mm fell at maricao one person lost their life on the island and damage was a minimal 150,000owing to effective evacuations only two people lost their lives in the dominican republic the core of beulah impacted areas devastated by hurricane inez a year prior and left extensive damage in its wake early reports indicated that more than 1,000people were left homeless across the barahona peninsula flash flooding affected the southern coasts of both the dominican republic and haitibeulah had limited impact on jamaica as it brushed the island as a weak tropical storm according to newspapers gale-force winds affected the nation though there were no reports of damagestriking cozumel island and the yucatan peninsula on september17 as category2 hurricane beulah caused considerable damage and killed 11 people across the region wind gusts up to 125mph 205kmh severed communication lines downed power lines and felled trees the puerto morelos lighthouse on the riviera maya was undermined by the storm it was never torn down and the leaning tower remains a tourist attraction in the area in mrida yucatn winds were recorded up to 75mph 120kmh under the force of the powerful winds several structures collapsed across the peninsula resulting in six fatalities nearly every buildings on cozumel island sustained damage roughly half of which lost their roofs four people were also killed in playa del carmen along the coast beulahs storm surge flooded areas within 600yd 550m of the coastline washing out roads and leaving graveyards of boats throughout the yucatan peninsula an estimated 5,000 people were left homeless and at least 30,000 were affected by the stormthroughout mexico beulah killed 19 people economic losses across tampico reached 500million pesosin texas upon landfall an 18 feet 5.5m to 20 feet 6.1m storm surge inundated lower padre island the force of the storm tide made 31 cuts completely through the barrier island padre island suffered significant devastation and the islands sensitive ecosystem was altered by the storm the highest sustained wind was reported as 136 miles per hour 219kmh recorded in the town of south padre island across the laguna madre from port isabel winds as high as 109 miles per hour 175kmh were measured at the brownsville national weather service office at landfall since the hurricane bent the anemometer 30degrees from the vertical it is possible the winds at brownsville were underestimated gusts of over 100 miles per hour 160kmh were recorded as far inland as the towns of mcallen edinburg mission and pharr some 50 miles 80km from the gulf coast beulah spawned a record 115 tornadoes which destroyed homes commercial property and inflicted serious damage on the regions agricultural industry the tornado record from beulah would survive until hurricane ivan set a new record in 2004 the rio grande valleys citrus industry based on cultivation of the famous ruby red grapefruit was particularly hard hitthe lower rio grande valley the four county region that comprises deep south texas was inundated with torrential rains within a 36hour period it dropped over 27 inches 690mm of rain near beeville texas falfurrias received more rain from beulah than it normally records during one year areas south of laredo san antonio and matagorda were isolated for more than a week due to the resulting flood on september 28 president lyndon baines johnson declared twenty-four counties in southern texas a disaster areaanimal life in the region responded in various ways to survive ants survived the floods by congregating in spheres of living colonies and floated down streams to safety predaceous beetle larvae preyed on frogs and rodents crustaceans from the beaches migrated en masse to the protection of high groundhurricane beulah caused an estimated us1.41billion 2010dollars in damage sources report 15 total deaths from the stormacross the yucatan peninsula the government of mexico set up an air lift of food and medical supplies to isolated areas by september18the name beulah was retired and will never be used for an atlantic hurricane again it was replaced with beth in 1971
