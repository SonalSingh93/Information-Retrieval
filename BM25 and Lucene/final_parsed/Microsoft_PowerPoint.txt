microsoft powerpoint  wikipedia microsoft powerpoint is a presentation program created by robert gaskins and dennis austin at a software company named forethought inc it was released on april 20 1987 initially for macintosh computers only microsoft acquired powerpoint for 14million three months after it appeared this was microsofts first significant acquisition and microsoft set up a new business unit for powerpoint in silicon valley where forethought had been locatedpowerpoint became a component of the microsoft office suite first offered in 1989 for macintosh and in 1990 for windows which bundled several microsoft apps beginning with powerpoint 4.0 1994 powerpoint was integrated into microsoft office development and adopted shared common components and a converged user interfacepowerpoints market share was very small at first prior to introducing a version for microsoft windows but grew rapidly with the growth of windows and of office since the late 1990s powerpoints worldwide market share of presentation software has been estimated at 95 percentpowerpoint was originally designed to provide visuals for group presentations within business organizations but has come to be very widely used in many other communication situations both in business and beyond the impact of this much wider use of powerpoint has been experienced as a powerful change throughout society with strong reactions including advice that it should be used less should be used differently or should be used betterthe first powerpoint version macintosh 1987 was used to produce overhead transparencies the second macintosh 1988 windows 1990 could also produce color 35mm slides the third version windows and macintosh 1992 introduced video output of virtual slideshows to digital projectors which would over time completely replace physical transparencies and slides a dozen major versions since then have added many additional features and modes of operation and have made powerpoint available beyond apple macintosh and microsoft windows adding versions for ios android and web accesspowerpoint was created by robert gaskins and dennis austin at a software startup in silicon valley named forethought inc forethought had been founded in 1983 to create an integrated environment and applications for future personal computers that would provide a graphical user interface but it had run into difficulties requiring a restart and new planon july 5 1984 forethought hired robert gaskins as its vice president of product development to create a new application that would be especially suited to the new graphical personal computers such as microsoft windows and apple macintosh gaskins produced his initial description of powerpoint about a month later august 14 1984 in the form of a 2-page document titled presentation graphics for overhead projection by october 1984 gaskins had selected dennis austin to be the developer for powerpoint gaskins and austin worked together on the definition and design of the new product for nearly a year and produced the first specification document dated august 21 1985 this first design document showed a product as it would look in microsoft windows 1.0 which at that time had not been releaseddevelopment from that spec was begun by austin in november 1985 for macintosh first about six months later on may 1 1986 gaskins and austin chose a second developer to join the project thomas rudkin gaskins prepared two final product specification marketing documents in june 1986 these described a product for both macintosh and windows at about the same time austin rudkin and gaskins produced a second and final major design specification document this time showing a macintosh lookthroughout this development period the product was called presenter then just before release there was a last-minute check with forethoughts lawyers to register the name as a trademark and presenter was unexpectedly rejected because it had already been used by someone else gaskins says that he thought of powerpoint based on the products goal of empowering individual presenters and sent that name to the lawyers for clearance while all the documentation was hastily revisedfunding to complete development of powerpoint was assured in mid-january 1987 when a new apple computer venture capital fund called apples strategic investment group selected powerpoint to be its first investment a month later on february 22 1987 forethought announced powerpoint at the personal computer forum in phoenix john sculley the ceo of apple appeared at the announcement and said we see desktop presentation as potentially a bigger market for apple than desktop publishingpowerpoint 1.0 for macintosh shipped from manufacturing on april 20 1987 and the first production run of 10,000 units was sold outby early 1987 microsoft was starting to plan a new application to create presentations an activity led by jeff raikes who was head of marketing for the applications division microsoft assigned an internal group to write a specification and plan for a new presentation product they contemplated an acquisition to speed up development and in early 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire dave winers product called more an outlining program that could print its outlines as bullet charts during this preparatory activity raikes discovered that a program specifically to make overhead presentations was already being developed by forethought inc and that it was nearly completed raikes and others visited forethought on february 6 1987 for a confidential demonstrationraikes later recounted his reaction to seeing powerpoint and his report about it to bill gates who was initially skepticali thought software to do overheadsthats a great idea i came back to see bill i said bill i think we really ought to do this and bill said no no no no no thats just a feature of microsoft word just put it into word  and i kept saying bill no its not just a feature of microsoft word its a whole genre of how people do these presentations and to his credit he listened to me and ultimately allowed me to go forward and  buy this company in silicon valley called forethought for the product known as powerpointwhen powerpoint was released by forethought its initial press was favorable the wall street journal reported on early reactions i see about one product a year i get this excited about says amy wohl a consultant in bala cynwyd pa people will buy a macintosh just to get access to this producton april 28 1987 a week after shipment a group of microsofts senior executives spent another day at forethought to hear about initial powerpoint sales on macintosh and plans for windows the following day microsoft sent a letter to dave winer withdrawing its earlier letter of intent to acquire his company and in mid-may 1987 microsoft sent a letter of intent to acquire forethought as requested in that letter of intent robert gaskins from forethought went to redmond for a one-on-one meeting with bill gates in early june 1987 and by the end of july an agreement was concluded for an acquisition the new york times reported july 30 the microsoft corporation announced its first significant software acquisition today paying 14million 29.5million in present-day terms for forethought inc of sunnyvale calif forethought makes a program called powerpoint that allows users of apple macintosh computers to make overhead transparencies or flip charts  the acquisition of forethought is the first significant one for microsoft which is based in redmond wash forethought would remain in sunnyvale giving microsoft a silicon valley presence the unit will be headed by robert gaskins forethoughts vice president of product developmentmicrosofts president jon shirley offered microsofts motivation for the acquisition we made this deal primarily because of our belief in desktop presentations as a product category  forethought was first to market with a product in this categorymicrosoft set up within its applications division an independent graphics business unit to develop and to market powerpoint the first microsoft application group distant from the main redmond location all the powerpoint people from forethought joined microsoft and the new location was headed by robert gaskins with dennis austin and thomas rudkin leading development powerpoint 1.0 for macintosh was modified to indicate the new microsoft ownership and continued to be solda new powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh adding color 35mm slides appeared by mid-1988 and again won good reviews the same powerpoint 2.0 product re-developed for windows was shipped two years later in mid-1990 at the same time as windows 3.0 much of the color technology was the fruit of a joint development partnership with genigraphics at that time the dominant presentation services companypowerpoint 3.0 which was shipped in 1992 for both windows and mac added live video for projectors and monitors with the result that powerpoint was thereafter used for delivering presentations as well as for preparing them this was at first an alternative to overhead transparencies and 35mm slides but over time would come to replace thempowerpoint had been included in microsoft office from the beginning powerpoint 2.0 for macintosh was part of the first office bundle for macintosh which was offered in mid-1989 when powerpoint 2.0 for windows appeared a year later it was part of a similar office bundle for windows which was offered in late 1990 both of these were bundling promotions in which the independent applications were packaged together and offered for a lower total pricepowerpoint 3.0 1992 was again separately specified and developed and was prominently advertised and sold separately from office it was as before included in microsoft office 3.0 both for windows and the corresponding version for macintosha plan to integrate the applications themselves more tightly had been indicated as early as february 1991 toward the end of powerpoint 3.0 development in an internal memo by bill gatesanother important question is what portion of our applications sales over time will be a set of applications versus a single product  please assume that we stay ahead in integrating our family together in evaluating our future strategiesthe product teams will deliver on this  i believe that we should position the office as our most important applicationthe move from bundling separate products to integrated development began with powerpoint 4.0 developed in 19931994 under new management from redmond the powerpoint group in silicon valley was reorganized from the independent graphics business unit gbu to become the graphics product unit gpu for office and powerpoint 4.0 changed to adopt a converged user interface and other components shared with the other apps in officewhen it was released the computer press reported on the change approvingly powerpoint 4.0 has been re-engineered from the ground up to resemble and work with the latest applications in office word 6.0 excel 5.0 and access 2.0 the integration is so good youll have to look twice to make sure youre running powerpoint and not word or excel office integration was further underscored in the following version powerpoint 95 which was given the version number powerpoint 7.0 skipping 5.0 and 6.0 so that all the components of office would share the same major version numberalthough powerpoint by this point had become part of the integrated microsoft office product its development remained in silicon valley succeeding versions of powerpoint introduced important changes particularly version 12.0 2007 which had a very different shared office ribbon user interface and a new shared office xml-based file format this marked the 20th anniversary of powerpoint and microsoft held an event to commemorate that anniversary at its silicon valley campus for the powerpoint team there special guests were robert gaskins dennis austin and thomas rudkin and the featured speaker was jeff raikes all from powerpoint 1.0 days 20 years beforesince then major development of powerpoint as part of office has continued new development techniques shared across office for powerpoint 2016 have made it possible to ship versions of powerpoint 2016 for windows mac ios android and web access nearly simultaneously and to release new features on a nearly-monthly schedule powerpoint development is still located in silicon valley as of 2017in 2010 jeff raikes who had most recently been president of the business division of microsoft including responsibility for office observed of course today we know that powerpoint is often times the number twoor in some cases even the number onemost-used tool among the applications in officepowerpoints initial sales were about 40,000 copies sold in 1987 nine months about 85,000 copies in 1988 and about 100,000 copies in 1989 all for macintosh powerpoints market share in its first three years was a tiny part of the total presentation market which was very heavily dominated by ms-dos applications on pcs the market leaders on ms-dos in 1988-1989 were harvard graphics introduced by software publishing in 1986 in first place and lotus freelance plus also introduced in 1986 as a strong second they were competing with more than a dozen other ms-dos presentation products and microsoft did not develop a powerpoint version for ms-dos after three years powerpoint sales were disappointing jeff raikes who had bought powerpoint for microsoft later recalled by 1990 it looked like it wasnt a very smart idea for microsoft to have acquired powerpoint because not very many people were using powerpointthis began to change when the first version for windows powerpoint 2.0 brought sales up to about 200,000 copies in 1990 and to about 375,000 copies in 1991 with windows units outselling macintosh powerpoint sold about 1million copies in 1992 of which about 80 percent were for windows and about 20 percent for macintosh and in 1992 powerpoints market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 63 percent by the last six months of 1992 powerpoint revenue was running at a rate of over 100million annually 211million in present-day termssales of powerpoint 3.0 doubled to about 2million copies in 1993 of which about 90 percent were for windows and about 10 percent for macintosh and in 1993 powerpoints market share of worldwide presentation graphics software sales was reported as 78 percent in both years about half of total revenue came from sales outside the usby 1997 powerpoint sales had doubled again to more than 4million copies annually representing 85 percent of the world market also in 1997 an internal publication from the powerpoint group said that by then over 20million copies of powerpoint were in use and that total revenues from powerpoint over its first ten years 1987 to 1996 had already exceeded 1billionsince the late 1990s powerpoints market share of total world presentation software has been estimated at 95 percent by both industry and academic sourcesthe earliest version of powerpoint 1987 for macintosh could be used to print black and white pages to be photocopied onto sheets of transparent film for projection from overhead projectors and to print speakers notes and audience handouts the next version 1988 for macintosh 1990 for windows was extended to also produce color 35mm slides by communicating a file over a modem to a genigraphics imaging center with slides returned by overnight delivery for projection from slide projectors powerpoint was used for planning and preparing a presentation but not for delivering it apart from previewing it on a computer screen or distributing printed paper copies the operation of powerpoint changed substantially in its third version 1992 for windows and macintosh when powerpoint was extended to also deliver a presentation by producing direct video output to digital projectors or large monitors in 1992 video projection of presentations was rare and expensive and practically unknown from a laptop computer robert gaskins one of the creators of powerpoint says he publicly demonstrated that use for the first time at a large microsoft meeting held in paris on february 25 1992 by using an unreleased development build of powerpoint 3.0 running on an early pre-production sample of a powerful new color laptop and feeding a professional auditorium video projectorby about 2003 ten years later digital projection had become the dominant mode of use replacing transparencies and 35mm slides and their projectors as a result the meaning of powerpoint presentation narrowed to mean specifically digital projection in the business lexicon powerpoint presentation had come to refer to a presentation made using a powerpoint slideshow projected from a computer although the powerpoint software had been used to generate transparencies for over a decade this usage was not typically encompassed by common understanding of the termin contemporary operation powerpoint is used to create a file called a presentation or deck containing a sequence of pages called slides in the app which usually have a consistent style from template masters and which may contain information imported from other apps or created in powerpoint including text bullet lists tables charts drawn shapes images audio clips video clips animations of elements and animated transitions between slides plus attached notes for each slideafter such a file is created typical operation is to present it as a slide show using a portable computer where the presentation file is stored on the computer or available from a network and the computers screen shows a presenter view with current slide next slide speakers notes for the current slide and other information video is sent from the computer to one or more external digital projectors or monitors showing only the current slide to the audience with sequencing controlled by the speaker at the computer a smartphone remote control built in to powerpoint for ios optionally controlled from apple watch and for android allows the presenter to control the show from elsewhere in the roomin addition to a computer slide show projected to a live audience by a speaker powerpoint can be used to deliver a presentation in a number of other wayssome of these ways of using powerpoint have been studied by joanne yates and wanda orlikowski of the mit sloan school of managementthe standard form of such presentations involves a single person standing before a group of people talking and using the powerpoint slideshow to project visual aids onto a screen  in practice however presentations are not always delivered in this mode in our studies we often found that the presenter sat at a table with a small group of people and walked them through a deck composed of paper copies of the slides in some cases decks were simply distributed to individuals without even a walk-through or discussion  other variations in form included sending the powerpoint file electronically to another site and talking through the slides over an audio or video channel eg telephone or video conference as both parties viewed the slides  another common variation was placing a powerpoint file on a web site for people to view at different timesthey found that some of these ways of using powerpoint could influence the content of presentations for example when the slides themselves have to carry more of the substance of the presentation and thus need considerably more content than they would have if they were intended for projection by a speaker who would orally provide additional details and nuance about content and contextpowerpoint more than most other personal computer applications has been experienced as a powerful force producing change throughout all of society in 2016 an analyst summed up the real mystery is  how come almost every organisation in the world is using powerpoint to communicate almost everything to almost everybody thats the real question how come powerpoint is everywherepowerpoint was originally targeted just for business presentations robert gaskins who was responsible for its design has written about his intended customers  i did not target other existing large groups of users of presentations such as school teachers or military officers  i also did not plan to target people who were not existing users of presentations  such as clergy and school children   our focus was purely on business users in small and large companies from one person to the largest multinationals business people had for a long time made presentations for sales calls and for internal company communications and powerpoint produced the same formats in the same style and for the same purposespowerpoint use in business grew over its first five years 1987-1992 to sales of about 1 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 63 percent over the following five years 1992-1997 powerpoint sales accelerated to a rate of about 4 million copies annually for worldwide market share of 85 percent the increase in business use has been attributed to network effects whereby additional users of powerpoint in a company or an industry increased its salience and value to other usersnot everyone immediately approved of the greater use of powerpoint for presentations even in business ceos who very early were reported to discourage or ban powerpoint presentations at internal business meetings included lou gerstner at ibm in 1993 scott mcnealy at sun microsystems in 1996 and steve jobs at apple in 1997 but even so rich gold a scholar who studied corporate presentation use at xerox parc could write in 1999 within todays corporation if you want to communicate an idea  you use powerpointat the same time that powerpoint was becoming dominant in business settings it was also being adopted for uses beyond business personal computing  scaled up the production of presentations  the result has been the rise of presentation culture in an information society nearly everyone presentsin 1998 at about the same time that gold was pronouncing powerpoints ubiquity in business the influential bell labs engineer robert w lucky could already write about broader uses the world has run amok with the giddy power of presentation graphics a new language is in the air and it is codified in powerpoint  in a family discussion about what to do on a given evening for example i feel like pulling out my laptop and giving a vugraph presentation   in church i am surprised that the preachers havent caught on yet  how have we gotten on so long without powerpointover a decade or so beginning in the mid 1990s powerpoint began to be used in many communication situations well beyond its original business presentation uses to include teaching in schools and in universities lecturing in scientific meetings and preparing their related poster sessions worshipping in churches making legal arguments in courtrooms displaying supertitles in theaters driving helmet-mounted displays in spacesuits for nasa astronauts giving military briefings issuing governmental reports undertaking diplomatic negotiations writing novels giving architectural demonstrations prototyping website designs creating animated video games creating art projects and even as a substitute for writing engineering technical reports and as an organizing tool for writing general business documentsby 2003 it seemed that powerpoint was being used everywhere julia keller reported for the chicago tribunepowerpoint  is one of the most pervasive and ubiquitous technological tools ever concocted in less than a decade it has revolutionized the worlds of business education science and communications swiftly becoming the standard for just about anybody who wants to explain just about anything to just about anybody else from corporate middle managers reporting on production goals to 4th-graders fashioning a show-and-tell on the french and indian war to church pastors explicating the seven deadly sins  powerpoint seems poised for world dominationas uses broadened cultural awareness of powerpoint grew and commentary about it began to appear with the widespread adoption of powerpoint came complaints  often very general statements reflecting dissatisfaction with modern media and communication practices as well as the dysfunctions of organizational culture indications of this awaremess included increasing mentions of powerpoint use in the dilbert comic strips of scott adams comic parodies of poor or inappropriate use such as the gettysburg address in powerpoint or summaries of shakespeares hamlet and nabokovs lolita in powerpoint and a vast number of publications on the general subject of powerpoint especially about how to use itout of all the analyses of powerpoint over a quarter of a century at least three general themes emerged as categories of reaction to its broader use 1 use it less avoid powerpoint in favor of alternatives such as using more-complex graphics and written prose or using nothing 2 use it differently make a major change to a powerpoint style that is simpler and pictorial turning the presentation toward a performance more like a steve jobs keynote and 3 use it better retain much of the conventional powerpoint style but learn to avoid making many kinds of mistakes that can interfere with communicationan early reaction was that the broader use of powerpoint was a mistake and should be reversed an influential example of this came from edward tufte an authority on information design who has been a professor of political science statistics and computer science at princeton and yale but is best known for his self-published books on data visualization which have sold nearly 2million copies as of 2014in 2003 he published a widely-read booklet titled the cognitive style of powerpoint revised in 2006 tufte found a number of problems with the cognitive style of powerpoint many of which he attributed to the standard default style templatespowerpoints convenience for some presenters is costly to the content and the audience these costs arise from the cognitive style characteristics of the standard default pp presentation foreshortening of evidence and thought low spatial resolution an intensely hierarchical single-path structure as the model for organizing every type of content breaking up narratives and data into slides and minimal fragments rapid temporal sequencing of thin information rather than focused spatial analysis conspicuous chartjunk and pp phluff branding of slides with logotypes a preoccupation with format not content incompetent designs for data graphics and tables and a smirky commercialism that turns information into a sales pitch and presenters into marketeers italics in originaltufte particularly advised against using powerpoint for reporting scientific analyses using as a dramatic example some slides made during the flight of the space shuttle columbia after it had been damaged by an accident at liftoff slides which poorly communicated the engineers limited understanding of what had happened for such technical presentations and for most occasions apart from its initial domain of sales presentations tufte advised against using powerpoint at all in many situations according to tufte it would be better to substitute high-resolution graphics or concise prose documents as handouts for the audience to study and discuss providing a great deal more detailmany commentators enthusiastically joined in tuftes vivid criticism of powerpoint uses and at a conference held in 2013 a decade after tuftes booklet appeared one paper claimed that despite all the criticism about his work tufte can be considered as the single most influential author in the discourse on powerpoint  while his approach was not rigorous from a research perspective his articles received wide resonance with the public at large    there were also others who disagreed with tuftes assertion that the powerpoint program reduces the quality of presenters thoughts steven pinker professor of psychology at mit and later harvard had earlier argued that if anything powerpoint if used well would ideally reflect the way we think pinker later reinforced this opinion any general opposition to powerpoint is just dumb  its like denouncing lecturesbefore there were awful powerpoint presentations there were awful scripted lectures unscripted lectures slide shows chalk talks and so onmuch of the early commentary on all sides was informal and anecdotal because empirical research had been limiteda second reaction to powerpoint use was to say that powerpoint can be used well but only by substantially changing its style of use this reaction is exemplified by richard e mayer a professor of psychology at the university of california santa barbara who has studied cognition and learning particularly the design of educational multimedia and who has published more than 500 publications including over 30 books mayers theme has been that in light of the science it is up to us to make a fundamental shift in our thinkingwe can no longer expect people to struggle to try to adapt to our powerpoint habits instead we have to change our powerpoint habits to align with the way people learntufte had argued his judgment that the information density of text on powerpoint slides was too low perhaps only 40 words on a slide leading to over-simplified messages mayer responded that his empirical research showed exactly the opposite that the amount of text on powerpoint slides was usually too high and that even fewer than 40 words on a slide resulted in powerpoint overload that impeded understanding during presentationsmayer suggested a few major changes from traditional powerpoint formatsmayers ideas are claimed by carmine gallo to have been reflected in steve jobss presentations mayer outlined fundamental principles of multimedia design based on what scientists know about cognitive functioning steve jobss slides adhere to each of mayers principles   though not unique to jobs many people saw the style for the first time in jobss famous product introductions steve jobs would have been using apples keynote which was designed for jobss own slide shows beginning in 2003 but gallo says that speaking like jobs has little to do with the type of presentation software you use powerpoint keynoteetc  all the techniques apply equally to powerpoint and keynote gallo adds that microsofts powerpoint has one big advantage over apples keynote presentation softwareits everywhere  its safe to say that the number of keynote presentations is miniscule in comparison with powerpoint although most presentation designers who are familiar with both formats prefer to work in the more elegant keynote system those same designers will tell you that the majority of their client work is done in powerpointconsistent with its association with steve jobss keynotes a response to this style has been that it is particularly effective for ballroom-style presentations as often given in conference center ballrooms where a celebrated and practiced speaker addresses a large passive audience but less appropriate for conference room-style presentations which are often recurring internal business meetings for in-depth discussion with motivated counterpartsa third reaction to powerpoint use was to conclude that the standard style is capable of being used well but that many small points need to be executed carefully to avoid impeding understanding this kind of analysis is particularly associated with stephen kosslyn a cognitive neuroscientist who specializes in the psychology of learning and visual communication and who has been head of the department of psychology at harvard has been director of stanfords center for advanced study in the behavioral sciences and has published some 300 papers and 14 bookskosslyn presented a set of psychological principles of human perception memory and comprehension that appears to capture the major points of agreement among researchers he reports that his experiments support the idea that that it is not intuitive or obvious how to create effective powerpoint presentations that conform to those agreed principles and that even small differences that might not seem significant to a presenter can produce very different results in audiences understanding for this reason kosslyn says users need specific education to be able to identify best ways to avoid flaws and failuresspecifically we hypothesized and found that the psychological principles are often violated in powerpoint slideshows across different fields   that some types of presentation flaws are noticeable and annoying to audience members   and that observers have difficulty identifying many violations in graphical displays in individual slides   these studies converge in painting the following picture powerpoint presentations are commonly flawed some types of flaws are more common than others flaws are not isolated to one domain or context and although some types of flaws annoy the audience flaws at the level of slide design are not always obvious to an untrained observer  the many flaws and failures identified were those likely to disrupt the comprehension or memory of the material among the most common examples were bulleted items are not presented individually growing the list from the top to the bottom more than four bulleted items appear in a single list more than two lines are used per bulleted sentence and words are not large enough ie greater than 20 point to be easily seen among audience reactions common problems reported were speakers read word-for-word from notes or from the slides themselves the slides contained too much material to absorb before the next slide was presented and the main point was obscured by lots of irrelevant detailkosslyn observes that these findings could help to explain why the many studies of instructional effectiveness of powerpoint have been inconclusive and conflicting if there were differences in the quality of the presentations tested in different studies that went unobserved because many may feel that good design is intuitively clearin 2007 kosslyn wrote a book about powerpoint in which he suggested a very large number of fairly modest changes to powerpoint styles and gave advice on recommended ways of using powerpoint in a later second book about powerpoint he suggested nearly 150 clarifying style changes in fewer than 150 pages kosslyn summarizes theres nothing fundamentally wrong with the powerpoint program as a medium rather i claim that the problem lies in how it is used  in fact this medium is a remarkably versatile tool that can be extraordinarily effective  for many purposes powerpoint presentations are a superior medium of communication which is why they have become standard in so many fieldsin 2017 an online poll of social media users in the uk was reported to show that powerpoint remains as popular with young tech-savvy users as it is with the baby boomers with about four out of five saying that powerpoint was a great tool for making presentations in part because powerpoint with its capacity to be highly visual bridges the wordy world of yesterday with the visual future of tomorrow also in 2017 the managerial communication group of mit sloan school of management polled their incoming mba students finding that results underscore just how differently this generation communicates as compared with older workers fewer than half of respondents reported doing any meaningful longer-form writing at work and even that minority mostly did so very infrequently but 85 percent of students named producing presentations as a meaningful part of their job responsibilities two-thirds report that they present on a daily or weekly basisso its no surprise that in-person presentations is the top skill they hope to improve one of the researchers concluded were not likely to see future workplaces with long-form writing the trend is toward presentations and slides and we dont see any sign of that slowing downuse of powerpoint by the us military services began slowly because they were invested in mainframe computers ms-dos pcs and specialized military-specification graphic output devices all of which powerpoint did not support but because of the strong military tradition of presenting briefings as soon as they acquired the computers needed to run it powerpoint became part of the us militaryby 2000 ten years after powerpoint for windows appeared it was already identified as an important feature of us armed forces culture in a front-page story in the wall street journalold-fashioned slide briefings designed to update generals on troop movements have been a staple of the military since world war ii but in only a few short years powerpoint has altered the landscape just as word processing made it easier to produce long meandering memos the spread of powerpoint has unleashed a blizzard of jazzy but often incoherent visuals instead of drawing up a dozen slides on a legal pad and running them over to the graphics department captains and colonels now can create hundreds of slides in a few hours without ever leaving their desks if the spirit moves them they can build in gunfire sound effects and images that explode like land mines  powerpoint has become such an ingrained part of the defense culture that it has seeped into the military lexicon powerpoint ranger is a derogatory term for a desk-bound bureaucrat more adept at making slides than tossing grenadesus military use of powerpoint may have influenced its use by armed forces of other countries foreign armed services also are beginning to get in on the act you cant speak with the us military without knowing powerpoint says margaret hayes an instructor at national defense university in washington dc who teaches latin american military officers how to use the softwareafter another 10 years in 2010 and again on its front page the new york times reported that powerpoint use in the military was then a military tool that has spun out of controllike an insurgency powerpoint has crept into the daily lives of military commanders and reached the level of near obsession the amount of time expended on powerpoint the microsoft presentation program of computer-generated charts graphs and bullet points has made it a running joke in the pentagon and in iraq and afghanistan  commanders say that behind all the powerpoint jokes are serious concerns that the program stifles discussion critical thinking and thoughtful decision-making not least it ties up junior officers  in the daily preparation of slides be it for a joint staff meeting in washington or for a platoon leaders pre-mission combat briefing in a remote pocket of afghanistanthe new york times account went on to say that as a result some us generals had banned the use of powerpoint in their operationspowerpoint makes us stupid gen james n mattis of the marine corps the joint forces commander said this month at a military conference in north carolina he spoke without powerpoint brig gen h r mcmaster who banned powerpoint presentations when he led the successful effort to secure the northern iraqi city of tal afar in 2005 followed up at the same conference by likening powerpoint to an internal threat its dangerous because it can create the illusion of understanding and the illusion of control general mcmaster said in a telephone interview afterward some problems in the world are not bullet-izableseveral incidents about the same time gave wide currency to discussions by serving military officers describing excessive powerpoint use and the organizational culture that encouraged it in response to the new york times story peter norvig and stephen m kosslyn sent a joint letter to the editor stressing the institutional culture of the military  many military personnel bemoan the overuse and misuse of powerpoint  the problem is not in the tool itself but in the way that people use itwhich is partly a result of how institutions promote misusethe two generals who had been mentioned in 2010 as opposing the institutional culture of excessive powerpoint use were both in the news again in 2017 when james n mattis became us secretary of defense and h r mcmaster was appointed as us national security advisormusician david byrne has been using powerpoint as a medium for art for years producing a book and dvd and showing at galleries his powerpoint-based artwork byrne has written i have been working with powerpoint the ubiquitous presentation software as an art medium for a number of years it started off as a joke this software is a symbol of corporate salesmanship or lack thereof but then the work took on a life of its own as i realized i could create pieces that were moving despite the limitations of the mediumin 2005 byrne toured with a theater piece styled as a powerpoint presentation when he presented it in berkeley on march 8 2005 the university of california news service reported byrne also defended its powerpoints appeal as more than just a business toolas a medium for art and theater his talk was titled i  powerpoint   berkeley alumnus bob gaskins and dennis austin  were in the audience   eventually byrne said powerpoint could be the foundation for presentational theater with roots in brechtian drama and asian puppet theater after that performance byrne described it in his own online journal did the powerpoint talk in berkeley for an audience of it legends and academics i was terrified the guys that originally turned powerpoint into a program were there what were they gonna think  gaskins did tell me afterwards that he liked the powerpoint as theater idea which was a reliefthe expressions powerpoint art or pptart are used to define a contemporary italian artistic movement which believes that the corporate world can be a unique and exceptional source of inspiration for the artist they say the pptart name refers to powerpoint the symbolic and abstract language developed by the corporate world which has become a universal and highly symbolic communication system beyond cultures and bordersthe wide use of powerpoint had by 2010 given rise to   a subculture of powerpoint enthusiasts that is teaching the old application new tricks and may even be turning a dry presentation format into a full-fledged artistic medium by using powerpoint animation to create games artworks anime and moviespowerpoint viewer is the name for a series of small free application programs to be used on computers without powerpoint installed to view project or print but not create or edit presentationsthe first version was introduced with powerpoint 3.0 in 1992 to enable electronic presentations to be projected using conference-room computers and to be freely distributed on windows it took advantage of the new feature of embedding truetype fonts within powerpoint presentation files to make such distribution easier the same kind of viewer app was shipped with powerpoint 3.0 for macintosh also in 1992beginning with powerpoint 2003 a feature called package for cd automatically managed all linked video and audio files plus needed fonts when exporting a presentation to a disk or flash drive or network location and also included a copy of a revised powerpoint viewer application so that the result could be presented on other pcs without installing anythingthe latest version that runs on windows was created in conjunction with powerpoint 2010 but it can also be used to view newer presentations created in powerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016  all transitions videos and effects appear and behave the same when viewed using powerpoint viewer as they do when viewed in powerpoint 2010 it supports presentations created using powerpoint 97 and later the latest version that runs on macintosh is powerpoint 98 viewer for the classic mac os and classic environment for macs supporting system 7.5 to mac os x tiger 10.4 it can open presentations only from powerpoint 3.0 4.0 and 8.0 powerpoint 98 although presentations created on mac can be opened in powerpoint viewer on windows as of 2017 the latest versions of powerpoint viewer for windows 2010 and for macintosh 1998 remain available for downloadsince powerpoint 2013 the recommended replacement for powerpoint viewer has been to use any computer with a browser and network access to display any accessible powerpoint presentation by using the free web app powerpoint onlineearly versions of powerpoint from 1987 through 1995 versions 1.0 through 7.0 evolved through a sequence of binary file formats different in each version as functionality was added that resulted in a stable binary format called a ppt file like all earlier binary formats that was shared as the default in powerpoint 97 through powerpoint 2003 for windows and in powerpoint 98 through powerpoint 2004 for mac that is in powerpoint versions 8.0 through 11.0 the specification document is actively maintained and can be freely downloaded because although no longer the default that binary format can be read and written by some later versions of powerpoint including the current powerpoint 2016 after the stable binary format was adopted versions of powerpoint continued to be able to read and write differing file formats from earlier versions but beginning with powerpoint 2007 and powerpoint 2008 for mac powerpoint version 12.0 this was the only binary format available for saving powerpoint 2007 version 12.0 no longer supported saving to binary file formats used earlier than powerpoint 97 version 8.0 ten years beforebinary filename extensionsbinary media typesthe big change in powerpoint 2007 and powerpoint 2008 for mac powerpoint version 12.0 was that the stable binary file format of 972003 was replaced as the default by a new zipped xml-based office open xml format pptx files microsofts explanation of the benefits of the change included smaller file sizes up to 75% smaller than comparable binary documents security through being able to identify and exclude executable macros and personal data less chance to be corrupted than binary formats and easier interoperability for exchanging data among microsoft and other business applications all while maintaining backward compatibilityxml filename extensionsxml media typesthe specification for the new format was published as an open standard ecma-376 through ecma international technical committee 45 tc45 the ecma 376 stardard was approved in december 2006 and was submitted for standardization through isoiec jtc 1/sc 34 wg4 in early 2007 the standardization process was contentious it was approved as isoiec 29500 in early 2008 copies of the isoiec standard specification are freely available in two parts these define two related standards known as transitional and strict the two standards were progressively adopted by powerpoint powerpoint version 12.0 2007 2008 for mac could read and write transitional format but could neither read nor write strict format powerpoint version 14.0 2010 2011 for mac could read and write transitional and also read but not write strict powerpoint version 15.0 and later beginning 2013 2016 for mac can read and write both transitional and strict formats the reason for the two variants was explained by microsoft the participants in the isoiec standardization process recognized two objectives with competing requirements the first objective was for the open xml standard to provide an xml-based file format that could fully support conversion of the billions of existing office documents without any loss of features content text layout or other information including embedded data the second was to specify a file format that did not rely on microsoft-specific data types they created two variants of open xmltransitional which supports previously-defined microsoft-specific data types and strict which does not rely on them prior versions of office that is 2007] have supported reading and writing transitional open xml and office 2010 can read strict open xml documents with the addition of write support for strict open xml office 2013 provides full support for both variants of open xmlthe powerpoint pptx file format called presentationml for presentation markup language contains separate structures for all the complex parts of a powerpoint presentation the specification documents run to over sixthousand pages because of the widespread use of powerpoint the standardized file formats are considered important for the long-term access to digital documents in library collections and archives according to the us library of congresspowerpoint 2013 and powerpoint 2016 provide options to set default saving to isoiec 29500 strict format but the initial default setting remains transitional for compatibility with legacy features incorporating binary data in existing documents powerpoint 2013 or powerpoint 2016 will both open and save files in the former binary format ppt for compatibility with older versions of the program but not versions older than powerpoint 97 in saving to older formats these versions of powerpoint will check to assure that no features have been introduced into the presentation which are incompatible with the older formatspowerpoint 2013 and 2016 will also save a presentation in many other file formats including pdf format mpeg-4 or wmv video as a sequence of single-picture files using image formats including gif jpeg png tiff and some older formats and as a single presentation file in which all slides are replaced with pictures powerpoint will both open and save files in opendocument presentation format odp for compatibility
