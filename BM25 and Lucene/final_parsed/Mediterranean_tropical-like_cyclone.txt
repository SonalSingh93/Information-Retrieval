mediterranean tropicallike cyclone  wikipedia mediterranean tropical-like cyclones sometimes referred to as mediterranean hurricanes or medicanes are rare meteorological phenomena observed in the mediterranean sea due to the dry nature of the mediterranean region formation of tropical cyclones is infrequent with only 99recorded tropical-like storms between 1948 and 2017 no agency however is officially responsible for monitoring the formation and development of medicanes tropical cyclogenesis typically occurs within two separate regions of the sea the first region encompassing areas of the western mediterranean is more conducive for development than the other the ionian sea to the east the rough mountainous geography of the region raises additional difficulties despite being favorable for the development of severe weather and convective activity in general and only with abnormal meteorological circumstances can medicanes form numerous studies have been conducted on the impact of global warming on mediterranean tropical cyclone formation generally concluding that fewer yet more intense storms would formthe development of tropical cyclones in the mediterranean sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions of cold air are often required a majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convectionthunderstormsand heavy precipitation the baroclinic properties of the mediterranean region with high temperature gradients also provides necessary instability for the formation of tropical cyclones another factor rising cool air provides necessary moisture as well warm sea surface temperatures ssts are mostly unnecessary however as most medicanes energy is derived from warmer air temperatures when these favorable circumstances coincide the genesis of warm-core mediterranean tropical cyclones often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows is possible in a conducive environment for formationseveral notable and damaging medicanes are known to have occurred in september 1969 a north african mediterranean tropical cyclone produced flooding that killed nearly 600individuals left 250,000homeless and crippled local economies a medicane in september1996 that developed in the balearic islands region spawned six tornadoes and inundated parts of the islands several medicanes have also been subject to extensive study such as those of january1982 january1995 september2006 november2011 and november2014 the january1995 storm is one of the best-studied mediterranean tropical cyclones with its close resemblance to tropical cyclones elsewhere and availability of observations the medicane of september2006 meanwhile is well-studied due to availability of existing observations and data in november2011 the noaas satellite analysis branch monitored a medicane named rolf by the free university of berlin fu berlin though it ceased doing so the following month in 2015 the noaa resumed issuing advisories for tropical systems in the mediterranean regionmediterranean tropical cyclones are not considered to be formally classified tropical cyclones and their region of formation is not officially monitored by any agency and though the satellite analysis branch released information related to a medicane in november2011 while it was active it ceased doing so on 16december 2011 the mediterranean sea however lies within the greek area of responsibility while frances mto-france national serves as a preparation service for the areas as well a majority of mediterranean tropical cyclones form over two separate regions the first more conducive for development than the other encompasses an area of the western mediterranean bordered by the balearic islands southern france and the shorelines of the islands of corsica and sardinia the second identified region of development in the ionian sea between sicily and greece and stretching south to libya is less favorable for tropical cyclogenesis an additional two regions in the aegean and adriatic seas produce fewer medicanes while activity is minimal in the levantine region the geographical distribution of mediterranean tropical cyclones is markedly different than that of other cyclones with the formation of regular cyclones centering on the pyrenees and atlas mountain ranges the gulf of genoa and the island of cyprus in the ionian sea although meteorological factors are most advantageous in the adriatic and aegean seas the closed nature of the regions geography bordered by land allows little time for further evolutionthe geography of mountain ranges bordering the mediterranean are conducive for severe weather and thunderstorms with the sloped nature of mountainous regions permitting the development of convective activity although the geography of the mediterranean region as well as its dry air typically prevent the formation of tropical cyclones when certain meteorological circumstances arise difficulties influenced by the regions geography are overcome the occurrence of tropical cyclones in the mediterranean sea is generally extremely rare with an average of 1.57forming annually and merely 99recorded occurrences of tropical-like storms discovered between 1948 and 2011 in a modern study with no definitive trend in activity in that period few medicanes form during the summer season though activity typically rises in autumn peaks in january and gradually decreases from february to may in the western mediterranean region of development approximately 0.75such systems form each year compared to 0.32in the ionian sea regionstudies have evaluated that global warming can result in higher observed intensities of tropical cyclones as a result of deviations in the surface energy flux and atmospheric composition which both heavily influence the development of medicanes as well in tropical and subtropical areas sea surface temperatures ssts rose 0.2c 0.36f within a 50-year period and in the north atlantic and western pacific tropical cyclone basins the potential destructiveness and energy of storms nearly doubled within the same duration evidencing a clear correlation between global warming and tropical cyclone intensities within a similarly recent 20-year period ssts in the mediterranean sea increased by 0.6 to 1c 1.1 to 1.8f though no observable increase in medicane activity has been noted as of yet in 2006 a computer-driven atmospheric model evaluated the future frequency of mediterranean cyclones between 2071 and 2100 projecting a decrease in autumn winter and spring cyclonic activity coinciding with a dramatic increase in formation near cyprus with both scenarios attributed to elevated temperatures as a result of global warming other studies however have been inconclusive forecasting both increases and decreases in duration number and intensity three independent studies using different methodologies and data evaluated that while medicane activity would likely decline with a rate depending on the climate scenario considered a higher percentage of those that formed would be of greater strengthfactors required for the formation of medicanes are somewhat different than that normally expected of tropical cyclones known to emerge over regions with sea surface temperatures ssts below 26c 79f mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability a majority of medicanes develop above regions of the mediterranean with ssts of 15 to 26c 59 to 79f with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea despite the low sea surface temperatures the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a baroclinic zoneregions with high differences in temperature and pressurepermits the formation of medicanes in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity where raised ssts are needed while significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of mediterranean tropical cyclones formation few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures not by anomalous ssts similar to tropical cyclones minimal wind sheardifference in wind speed and direction over a regionas well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the mediterranean seadue to the confined character of the mediterranean and the limited capability of heat fluxesin the case of medicanes airsea heat transfertropical cyclones with a diameter larger than 300km 190mi cannot exist within the mediterranean despite being a relatively baroclinic area with high temperature gradients the primary energy source utilized by mediterranean tropical cyclones is derived from underlying heat sources generated by the presence of convectionthunderstorm activityin a humid environment similar to tropical cyclones elsewhere outside the mediterranean sea in comparison to other tropical cyclone basins the mediterranean sea generally presents a difficult environment for development although the potential energy necessary for development is not abnormally large its atmosphere is characterized by its lack of moisture impeding potential formation the full development of a medicane often necessitates the formation of a large-scale baroclinic disturbance transitioning late in its life cycle into a tropical cyclone-like system nearly always under the influence of a deep cut-off cold-core low within the middle-to-upper troposphere frequently resulting from abnormalities in a wide-spreading rossby wavemassive meanders of upper-atmospheric windsthe development of medicanes often results from the vertical shift of air in the troposphere as well resulting in a decrease in its temperature coinciding with an increase in relative humidity creating an environment more conducive for tropical cyclone formation this in turn leads to in an increase in potential energy producing heat-induced air-sea instability moist air prevents the occurrence of convective downdraftsthe vertically downward movement of airwhich often hinder the inception of tropical cyclones and in such a scenario wind shear remains minimal overall cold-core cut-off lows serve well for the later formation of compact surface flux-influenced warm-core lows such as medicanes the regular genesis of cold-core upper-level lows and the infrequency of mediterranean tropical cyclones however indicate that additional unusual circumstances are involved the emergence of the latter elevated sea surface temperatures contrasting with cold atmospheric air encourage atmospheric instability especially within the tropospherein general most medicanes maintain a radius of 70 to 200km 40 to 120mi last between 12hours and 5days travel between 700 to 3,000km 430 to 1,860mi develop an eye for less than 72hours and feature wind speeds of up to 144kmh 89mph in addition a majority are characterized on satellite imagery as asymmetric systems with a distinct round eye encircled by atmospheric convection weak rotation similar to that in most tropical cyclones is usually noted in a medicanes early stages increasing with intensity medicanes however often have less time to intensify remaining weaker than most north atlantic hurricanes and only persisting for the duration of a few days the maximum achievable intensity of medicanes is equivalent to the lowest classification on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale category1 while the entire lifetime of a cyclone may encompass several days most will only retain tropical characteristics for less than 24hours circumstances sometimes permit the formation of smaller-scale medicanes although the required conditions differ even from those needed by other medicanes the development of abnormally small tropical cyclones in the mediterranean usually requires upper-level atmospheric cyclones inducing cyclogenesis in the lower atmosphere leading to the formation of warm-core lows encouraged by favorable moisture heat and other environmental circumstancesmediterranean cyclones have been compared to polar lowscyclonic storms which typically develop in the far regions of the northern and southern hemispheresfor their similarly small size and heat-related instability however while medicanes nearly always feature warm-core lows polar lows are primarily cold-core the prolonged life of medicanes and similarity to polar lows is caused primarily by origins as synoptic-scale surface lows and heat-related instability heavy precipitation and convection within a developing mediterranean tropical cyclone are usually incited by the approach of an upper-level troughan elongated area of low air pressuresbringing downstream cold air encircling an existing low-pressure system after this occurs however a considerable reduction in rainfall rates occurs despite further organization coinciding with a decrease in previously high lightning activity as well although troughs will often accompany medicanes along their track separation eventually occurs usually in the later part of a mediterranean tropical cyclones life cycle at the same time moist air saturated and cooled while rising into the atmosphere then encounters the medicane and permits further development and evolution into a tropical cyclone many of these characteristics are also evident in polar lowsan unusually severe mediterranean tropical cyclone developed on 23september 1969 southeast of malta producing severe flooding steep pressure and temperature gradients above the atlas mountain range were evident on 19september a result of cool sea air attempting to penetrate inland south of the mountains a lee depressiona low-pressure area in a mountainous regiondeveloped under the influence of mountainous terrain the low initially meandered northeastward following the entry of cool sea air however it recurved to the southeast before transitioning into a saharan depression associated with a distinct cold front by 22september along the fronts path desert air moved northward while cold air drifted in the opposite direction and in northern libya warm arid air clashed with the cooler levant of the mediterranean the organization of the disturbance improved slightly further before emerging into the mediterranean sea on 23september upon which the system experienced immediate cyclogenesis rapidly intensifying while southeast of malta as a cold-core cut-off low and acquiring tropical characteristics in western africa meanwhile several disturbances converged toward mauritania and algeria while the medicane recurved southwestward back toward the coast losing its closed circulation and later dissipatingthe cyclone produced severe flooding throughout regions of northern africa malta received upward of 123mm 4.8in of rainfall on 23september sfax measured 45mm 1.8in on 24september tizi ouzou collected 55mm 2.2in on 25september gafsa received 79mm 3.1in and istanbul measured 46mm 1.8in on 26september cap bengut collected 43mm 1.7in on 27september and biskra received 122mm 4.8in on 28september in malta a 20000-ton tanker struck a reef and split in two while in gafsa tunisia the cyclone flooded phosphate mines leaving over 25,000miners unemployed and costing the government over 2million per week thousands of camels and snakes drowned by flood waters were swept out to sea and massive roman bridges which withstood all floods since the fall of the roman empire collapsed in all the floods in tunisia and algeria killed almost 600individuals left 250,000homeless and severely damaged regional economies due to communication problems however flood relief funds and television appeals were not set up until nearly a month laterthe unusual mediterranean tropical storm of january1982 was first detected in waters north of libya the storm likely reached the atlas mountain range as a low-pressure area by 23january 1982 reinforced by an elongated slowly-drifting trough above the iberian peninsula eventually a closed circulation center developed by 1310utc over parts of the mediterranean with sea surface temperatures ssts of approximately 16c 61f and air temperature of 12c 54f a hook-shaped cloud developed within the system shortly thereafter rotating as it elongated into a 150km 93mi-long comma-shaped apparatus after looping around sicily it drifted eastward between the island and peloponnese recurving on its track again exhibiting clearly curved spiral banding before shrinking slightly the cyclone reached its peak intensity at 1800utc on the following day maintaining an atmospheric pressure of 992mbar 29.30inhg and was succeeded by a period of gradual weakening with the systems pressure eventually rising to 1009mbar 29.80inhg the system slightly reintensified however for a six-hour period on 26january ship reports indicated winds of 93kmh 57.7mph or 50.2 kt were present in the cyclone at the time tropical storm-force winds on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale likely near the eyewall of the cyclone which features the highest winds in a tropical cyclonethe global weather centers cyclone weather center of the united states air force usaf initiated mediterranean cyclone advisories on the cyclone at six-hour intervals starting at 1800utc on 27january until 0600utc on the following day convection was most intense in the eastern sector of the cyclone as it drifted east-northeastward on infrared satellite imagery the eye itself was 58.5km 36.4mi in diameter contracting to just 28 kilometres 17mi one day prior to making landfall the cyclone passed by malta italy and greece before dissipating several days later in the extreme eastern mediterranean observations related to the cyclone however were inadequate and although the system maintained numerous tropical characteristics it is possible it was merely a compact but powerful extratropical cyclone exhibiting a clear eye spiral banding towering cumulonimbi and high surface winds along the eyewallamong numerous documented medicanes the cyclone of january1995 is generally considered to be the best-documented instance emerging off of the libyan coast into the central mediterranean sea toward the ionian shoreline of greece on 13january as a compact low-pressure area the precursor low maintained winds reaching up to 108kmh 67mph as it traversed the ionian sea while the german research ship meteor noted winds of 135kmh 84mph upon the lows approach near greece it began to envelop an area of atmospheric convection meanwhile in the middle troposphere a trough extended from russia to the mediterranean bringing with it extremely cold temperatures two low-pressure areas were present along the path of the trough with one situated above ukraine and the other above the central mediterranean likely associated with a low-level cyclone over western greece upon weakening and dissipation on 14january a second low the system which would evolve into the mediterranean tropical cyclone developed in its place on 15januaryat the time of formation high clouds indicated the presence of intense convection and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure with a distinct cloud-free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole soon thereafter the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward meandering toward the aegean sea and turkey initially remaining stationary between greece and sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002mbar 29.59inhg the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low now far to the east and a high-pressure area above central and eastern europe the systems atmospheric pressure increased throughout 15january due to the fact it was embedded within a large-scale environment with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region and was not a sign of deintensificationinitial wind speeds within the young medicane were generally low with sustained winds of merely 28 to 46kmh 17 to 29mph with the highest recorded value associated with the disturbance being 63kmh 39mph at 0000utc on 16january slightly below the threshold for tropical storm on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale its structure now consisted of a distinct eye encircled by counterclockwise-rotating cumulonimbi with cloud top temperatures colder than 50c 58f evidencing deep convection and a regular feature observed in most tropical cyclones at 1200 utc on 16 january a ship recorded winds blowing east-southeast of about 50 knots 93kmh south-southwest about 50km 31mi north-northeast of the cyclones center intense convection continued to follow the entire path of the system as it traversed the mediterranean and the cyclone made landfall in northern libya at approximately 1800utc on 17january rapidly weakening after coming ashore as it moved inland a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1012mbar 29.89inhg was recorded accompanied by wind speeds of 93kmh 58mph as it slowed down after passing through the gulf of sidra although the system retained its strong convection for several more hours the cyclones cloud tops began to warm evidencing lower clouds before losing tropical characteristics entirely on 17january offshore ship reports recorded that the medicane produced intense winds copious rainfall and abnormally warm temperaturesthree notable medicanes developed in 1996 the first in mid-september1996 was a typical mediterranean tropical cyclone that developed in the balearic islands region at the time of the cyclones formation a powerful atlantic cold front and a warm front associated with a large-scale low producing northeasterly winds over the iberian peninsula extended eastward into the mediterranean while abundant moisture gathered in the lower troposphere over the balearic channel on the morning of 12september a disturbance developed off of valencia spain dropping heavy rainfall on the coast even without coming ashore an eye developed shortly thereafter as the system rapidly traversed across majorca and sardinia in its eastward trek it made landfall upon the coast of southern italy on the evening of 13september with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 990mbar 29.24inhg dissipating shortly after coming ashore with a diameter of about 150km 93miat valencia and other regions of eastern spain the storm generated heavy precipitation while six tornadoes touched down over the balearic islands while approaching the coast of the balearic islands the warm-core low induced a pressure drop of 11mbar 0.32inhg at palma majorca in advance of the tropical cyclones landfall medicanes as small as the one that formed in september1996 are atypical and often require circumstances different even from those required for regular mediterranean tropical cyclone formation warm low-level advectiontransfer of heat through air or seacaused by a large-scale low over the western mediterranean was a primary factor in the rise of strong convection the presence of a mid- to upper-level cut-off cold-core low a method of formation typical to medicanes was also key to the development of intense thunderstorms within the cyclone in addition interaction between a northeastward-drifting trough the medicane and the large-scale also permitted the formation of tornadoes within thunderstorms generated by the cyclone after making landfallthe second of the three recorded mediterranean tropical cyclones in 1996 formed between sicily and tunisia on 4october making landfall on both sicily and southern italy the medicane generated major flooding in sicily meanwhile in calabria wind gusts of up to 108kmh 67mph were reported in addition to severe inundation the third major mediterranean tropical cyclone of that year formed north of algeria and strengthened while sweeping between the balearic islands and sardinia with an eye-like feature prominent on satellite the eye was distorted and disappeared after transiting over southern sardinia throughout the evening of 8october with the system weakening as a whole on the morning of october9 a smaller eye emerged as the system passed over the tyrrhenian sea gradually strengthening with reports 100km 62mi from the storms center reporting winds of 90kmh 56mph extreme damage was reported in the aeolian islands after the tropical cyclone passed north of sicily though the system dissipated while turning southward over calabria overall the lowest estimated atmospheric pressure in the third medicane was 998mbar 29.47inhg both october systems featured distinctive spiral bands intense convection high sustained winds and abundant precipitationa short-lived medicane developed near the end of september2006 along the coast of italy the origins of the medicane can be traced to the alpine atlas mountain range on the evening of 25september likely forming as a normal lee cyclone at 0600utc on 26september european centre for medium-range weather forecasts ecmwf model analyses indicated the existence of two low-pressure areas along the shoreline of italy one on the west coast sweeping eastward across the tyrrhenian sea while the other slightly more intense low was located over the ionian sea as the latter low approached the strait of sicily it met an eastward-moving convection-producing cold front resulting in significant intensification while the system simultaneously reduced in size it then achieved a minimum atmospheric pressure of approximately 986mbar 29.12inhg after transiting north-northeastward across the 40km 25mi-wide salentine peninsula in the course of roughly 30minutes at 0915utc the same daywind gusts surpassing 144kmh 89mph were recorded as it passed over salento due to a steep pressure gradient associated with it confirmed by regional radar observations denoting the presence of a clear eye the high winds inflicted moderate damages throughout the peninsula though specific damage is unknown around 1000utc both radar and satellite recorded the systems entry into the adriatic sea and its gradual northwestward curve back toward the italian coast by 1700utc the cyclone made landfall in northern apulia while maintaining its intensity with a minimum atmospheric pressure at 988mbar 29.18inhg the cyclone weakened while drifting further inland over the italian mainland eventually dissipating as it curved west-southwestward a later study in 2008 evaluated that the cyclone possessed numerous characteristics seen in tropical cyclones elsewhere with a spiral appearance eye-like apparatus rapid atmospheric pressure decreases in advance of landfall and intense sustained winds concentrated near the storms eyewall the apparent eye-like structure in the cyclone however was ill-defined since then the medicane has been the subject of significant study as a result of the availability of scientific observations and reports related to the cyclone in particular the sensitivity of this cyclone to sea-surface temperatures initial conditions the model and the parameterization schemes used in the simulations were analyzed the relevance of different instability indices for the diagnosis and the prediction of these events were also studiedin november2011 the first officially designated mediterranean tropical cyclone by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa formed christened as 01m by the satellite analysis branch and given the name rolf by the free university of berlin fu berlin despite the fact that no agency is officially responsible for monitoring tropical cyclone activity in the mediterranean on 4november 2011 a frontal system associated with another low-pressure area monitored by fu berlin designated quinn spawned a second low-pressure system inland near marseille which was subsequently named rolf by the university an upper-level trough on the european mainland stalled as it approached the pyrenees before approaching and interacting with the low known as rolf heavy rainfall consequently fell over regions of southern france and northwestern italy resulting in widespread landslides and flooding on 5november rolf slowed while stationed above the massif central maintaining a pressure of 1000mbar 29.53inhg a stationary front stationed between madrid and lisbon approached rolf the same day with the cold front later encountering and become associated with rolf which would continue for several dayson 6november the cyclone drifted toward the mediterranean from the southern shoreline of france shrinking to a diameter of merely 150km 93mi across slightly weakening rolf neared the balearic islands on 7november associated with two fronts producing heavy rain throughout europe before separating entirely and transitioning into a cut-off low the same day the noaa began monitoring the system designating it as 01m marking the first time it officially monitored a medicane a distinct eye-like feature developed while spiral banding and intense convection became evident at its highest the dvorak technique classified the system as t3.0 convection gradually decreased and a misalignment of the mid- and upper- level centers was noted the system continued to rapidly weaken on 9november before advisories were halted on the system later that day and fu berlin followed suit by 10november removing the name rolf from its weather maps and declaring its dissipation the deep warm core of this cyclone persisted for a longer time compared to other tropical-like cyclones in the mediterraneanon 6 november 2014 the low-level circulation centre of qendresa formed near kerkennah islands as the system was moving north-northeastwards and combining with an upper-level low from tunisia early on 7 november the system occluded quickly and intensified dramatically with an eye-like feature thanks to favourable conditions qendresa directly hit malta when it had lost its fronts with a more well-defined eye with ten-minute sustained winds at 110.9kmh 68.9mph and the gust at 153.7kmh 95.5mph the central pressure was presumed to be 978 hpa 28.88 inhg interacting with sicily the cyclone turned northeastwards and started to make an anticlockwise loop on 8 november qendresa crossed syracuse in the morning and then significantly weakened turning southeastwards then moving eastwards qendressa moved over crete before dissipating over the island on november 11on early 28 october 2016 35mph 60kmh winds began to form into an extratropical cyclone south of calabria in the ionian sea it quickly intensified attaining wind speeds of 50mph 80kmh as it slowly moved to the west causing high waves and minor damage to cars near the maltese city of valletta weakening the following day and beginning to move eastwards however later that day it began to re-intensify becoming a tropical storm on 31 october after passing over crete it then began to quickly weaken with the storm degenerating into an extratropical low on 1 november tropical storm 90m was also nicknamed medicane trixi by some media outlets in europe during its durationnumerous other mediterranean cyclones have occurred but few have been as well-documented as those in 1969 1982 1995 1996 2006 2011 and 2014 on 27september 1983 a medicane was observed at sea between tunisia and sicily looping around sardinia and corsica coming ashore twice on the islands before making landfall at tunis early on 2october and dissipating the development of the system was not encouraged by baroclinic instability rather convection was incited by abnormally high sea surface temperatures ssts at the time of its formation it also featured a definitive eye tall cumulonimbus clouds intense sustained winds and a warm core for most of its duration it maintained a diameter of 200 to 300km 120 to 190mi though it shrank just before landfall on ajaccio to a diameter of 100km 62mi four other notable cyclones occurred in the late twentieth century on 26march1983 2930december1984 3031october1997 and
