additional mortality although salinity levels returned to normal within six weeks dissolved oxygen concentrations remained quite low for a longer time frame marine life was scarce for several months in areas of greatest oxygen depletion sports fishing in the area took a few months to recover juvenile pink shrimp moved from their estuarine nursery grounds into deeper water about 60 miles 97km offshore where they were subsequently captured by fishermen a caspian tern was swept up the north american coast well to the north of its traditional breeding grounds to nova scotia which was
