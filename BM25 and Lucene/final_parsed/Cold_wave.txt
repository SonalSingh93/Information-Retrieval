cold wave  wikipedia a cold wave known in some regions as a cold snap is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air specifically as used by the us national weather service a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture industry commerce and social activities the precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls and the minimum to which it falls this minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of yearin the united states a cold spell is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below 20f 7ca cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals including humans and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of hypothermia or starvation they often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmerscold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events in developed countries more deaths occur during a heat wave than in a cold snap though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world globally more people die of cold weather than hot weather due to the rise in diseases like cold flu and pneumoniaextreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze even some poorly protected indoor plumbing ruptures as water expands within them causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims demand for electrical power and fuels rises dramatically during such times even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of hydroelectricity some metals may become brittle at low temperatures motor vehicles may fail when antifreeze fails or motor oil gels producing a failure of the transportation system to be sure such is more likely in places like siberia and much of canada that customarily get very cold weatherfires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable making firefighting more difficult the air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense firewinter cold waves that arent considered cold in some areas but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area are also destructive areas with subtropical climates may recognize unusual cold perhaps barely freezing temperatures as a cold wave in such places plant and animal life is less tolerant of such cold as may appear rarely the same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for colorado ohio or bavaria are catastrophic to winter crops in places like florida california or parts of south america that grow fruit and vegetables in wintercold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically such cold waves have caused famines at times as deadly to plants as drought cold waves can leave a land in danger of later brush and forest fires that consume dead biomass one extreme was the so-called year without a summer of 1816 one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions that reduced incoming sunlightin some places such as siberia extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously internal plumbing can be wrapped and persons can often run water continuously through pipes energy conservation difficult as it is in a cold wave may require such measures as collecting people especially the poor and elderly in communal shelters even the homeless may be arrested and taken to shelters only to be released when the hazard abates hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelterspeople can stock up on food water and other necessities before a cold wave some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates at least during the winter suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered smudge pots can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding airmost people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail they can also stock candles matches flashlights and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves as necessary however caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to carbon monoxide poisoning adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to coldthe first snowfall began on 17 december 2009 before a respite over the christmas period the most severe snowy weather began on 5 january in north west england and west scotland with temperatures hitting a low of 17.6c 0.3f in greater manchester england the snow spread to southern england on 6 january and by 7 january the united kingdom was blanketed in snow which was captured by nasas terra satellite the thaw came a week later as temperatures started to increase the winter weather brought widespread transport disruption school closures power failures the postponement of sporting events and 25deaths a low of 22.3c 8.1f was recorded in altnaharra scotland on 8 january 2010 overall it was the coldest winter since 197879 with a mean temperature of 1.5c 34.7f
