of puerto rico while its official english name is commonwealth of puerto ricothe ancient history of the archipelago which is now puerto rico is not well known unlike other indigenous cultures in the new world aztec maya and inca which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies scant artifacts and evidence remain of the puerto ricos indigenous population scarce archaeological findings and early spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them the first comprehensive book on the history of puerto rico was written by fray igo abbad y lasierra in 1786 nearly three centuries after the first spaniards landed on the islandthe first known settlers were the ortoiroid people an archaic period culture of amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the south american mainland some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years an archeological dig in 1990 on the island of vieques found the remains of a man designated as the puerto ferro man which was dated to around 2000 bc the ortoiroid were displaced by the saladoid a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 bcthe igneri tribe migrated to puerto rico between 120 and 400ad from the region of the orinoco river in northern south america the arcaico and igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuriesbetween the 7th and 11th centuries the tano culture developed on the island by approximately 1000ad it had become dominant at the time of columbus arrival an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 tano amerindians led by the cacique chief ageyban inhabited the island they called it boriken meaning the great land of the valiant and noble lord the natives lived in small villages each led by a cacique they subsisted by hunting and fishing done generally by men as well as by the womens gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit this lasted until columbus arrived in 1493when columbus arrived in puerto rico during his second voyage on november 19 1493 the island was inhabited by the tano they called it borikn borinquen in spanish transliteration columbus named the island san juan bautista in honor of st john the baptist  having reported the findings of his first travel columbus brought with him this time a letter from king ferdinand empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the spanish empire and the christian faith juan ponce de len a lieutenant under columbus founded the first spanish settlement caparra on august 8 1508 he later served as the first governor of the island eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as puerto rico and san juan became the name of the main tradingshipping portat the beginning of the 16th century the spanish people began to colonize the island despite the laws of burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population some tano indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization the population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of european infectious diseasesin 1520 king charles i of spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining tano population by that time the tano people were few in number enslaved africans had already begun to compensate for the native labor loss but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony other nearby islands like cuba saint-domingue and guadeloupe attracted more of the slave trade than puerto rico probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the atlantic slave tradefrom the beginning of the country the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses primarily in coastal ports and cities where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down with no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements particularly around san juan also forming lasting afro-creole communities meanwhile in the islands interior there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy this mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and in relative isolation set the pattern for what later would be known as the puerto rican jbaro culture by the end of the 16th century the spanish empire was diminishing and in the face of increasing raids from european competitors the colonial administration throughout the americas fell into a bunker mentality imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the kings silver-laden atlantic fleet to the iberian peninsula san juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the atlantic by its powerful trade winds west indies convoys linked spain to the island sailing between cdiz and the spanish west indies the colonys seat of government was on the forested islet of san juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the spanish caribbean earning the name of the walled city the islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls such as la fortaleza castillo san felipe del morro and castillo san cristbal designed to protect the population and the strategic port of san juan from the raids of the spanish european competitorsin 1625 in the battle of san juan the dutch commander boudewijn hendricksz tested the defenses limits like no one else before learning from francis drakes previous failures here he circumvented the cannons of the castle of san felipe del morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the san juan bay he then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the morros moat and high battlements historians consider this event the worst attack on san juan though the dutch set the village on fire they failed to conquer the morro and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until hendricksz deemed the cause lost hendrickszs expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy constructions of defenses for the san cristbal hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the morros artillery urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in spanish handsduring the late 16th and early 17th centuries spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland north central and south american colonies with the advent of the lively bourbon dynasty in spain in the 1700s the island of puerto rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention more roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities and coastal settlements like arecibo mayaguez and ponce began acquiring importance of their own separate from san juan by the end of the 18th century merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the mercantilist system which turned each colony solely toward the european metropole and limited contact with other nations us ships came to surpass spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the islands natural resources slavers which had made but few stops on the island before began selling more enslaved africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations the increasing number of atlantic wars in which the caribbean islands played major roles like the war of jenkins ear the seven years war and the atlantic revolutions ensured puerto ricos growing esteem in madrids eyes on april 17 1797 sir ralph abercromby fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,00013,000 men which included german soldiers and royal marines and 60 to 64 ships fierce fighting continued for the next days with spanish troops both sides suffered heavy losses on sunday april 30 the british ceased their attack and began their retreat from san juan by the time independence movements in the larger spanish colonies gained success new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in puerto rico helping to tilt the islands political balance toward the crownin 1809 to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the european peninsular war the supreme central junta based in cdiz recognized puerto rico as an overseas province of spain this gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened spanish parliament cdiz cortes with equal representation to mainland iberian mediterranean balearic islands and atlantic maritime spanish provinces canary islandsramn power y giralt the first spanish parliamentary representative from the island of puerto rico died after serving a three-year term in the cortes these parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814 and again from 1820 to 1823 they were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by ferdinand vii immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the islands ethnic european population and economy and expanded the spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the islandminor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years with the revolt planned and organized by marcos xiorro in 1821 being the most important even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of puerto ricos folklorein the early 19th century puerto rico spawned an independence movement that due to harsh persecution by the spanish authorities convened in the island of st thomas the movement was largely inspired by the ideals of simn bolvar in establishing a united provinces of new granada and venezuela that included puerto rico and cuba among the influential members of this movement were brigadier general antonio valero de bernab and mara de las mercedes barbudo the movement was discovered and governor miguel de la torre had its members imprisoned or exiledwith the increasingly rapid growth of independent former spanish colonies in the south and central american states in the first part of the 19th century the spanish crown considered puerto rico and cuba of strategic importance to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies the spanish crown revived the royal decree of graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants mainly spaniards settled on the island in the period up until the american conquest printed in three languagesspanish english and frenchit was intended to also attract non-spanish europeans with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the crown hundreds of non spanish families mainly from corsica france germany ireland italy and scotland also immigrated to the islandfree land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the spanish crown and allegiance to the roman catholic church the offer was very successful and european immigration continued even after 1898 puerto rico still receives spanish and european immigrationpoverty and political estrangement with spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as grito de lares it began in the rural town of lares but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of san sebastinleaders of this independence movement included ramn emeterio betances considered the father of the puerto rican independence movement and other political figures such as segundo ruiz belvis slavery was abolished in puerto rico in 1873 with provisions for periods of apprenticeshipleaders of el grito de lares went into exile in new york city many joined the puerto rican revolutionary committee founded on december 8 1895 and continued their quest for puerto rican independence in 1897 antonio mattei lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in yauco organized another uprising which became known as the intentona de yauco they raised what they called the puerto rican flag which was adopted as the national flag the local conservative political factions opposed independence rumors of the planned event spread to the local spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to spanish colonial rulein 1897 luis muoz rivera and others persuaded the liberal spanish government to agree to grant limited self-government to the island by royal decree in the autonomic charter including a bicameral legislature in 1898 puerto ricos first but short-lived quasi-autonomous government was organized as an overseas province of spain this bilaterally agreed-upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the king of spain  who held the power to annul any legislative decision  and a partially elected parliamentary structure in february governor-general manuel macas inaugurated the new government under the autonomic charter general elections were held in march and the new government began to function on july 17 1898in 1890 captain alfred thayer mahan a member of the navy war board and leading us strategic thinker published a book titled the influence of sea power upon history in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the british royal navy part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the caribbean which would serve as coaling and naval stations they would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the isthmus of panama to allow easier passage of ships between the atlantic and pacific oceanswilliam h seward the former secretary of state under presidents abraham lincoln and andrew johnson had also stressed the importance of building a canal in honduras nicaragua or panama he suggested that the united states annex the dominican republic and purchase puerto rico and cuba the us senate did not approve his annexation proposal and spain rejected the us offer of  dollars for puerto rico and cubasince 1894 the united states naval war college had been developing contingency plans for a war with spain by 1896 the us office of naval intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in puerto rican waters except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named isle of pines later renamed as isla de la juventud a recommendation dropped in later planning plans developed for attacks on spanish territories were intended as support operations against spains forces in and around cuba recent research suggests that the us did consider puerto rico valuable as a naval station and recognized that it and cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar  a valuable commercial commodity which the united states lacked before the development of the sugar beet industry in the united stateson july 25 1898 during the spanishamerican war the us invaded puerto rico with a landing at gunica as an outcome of the war spain ceded puerto rico along with the philippines and guam then under spanish sovereignty to the us

independence the puerto rican status referendum 2017 in june 2017 was going to offer only two options statehood and independencefree association however a letter from the donald trump administration recommended adding the commonwealth the current status in the plebiscite the option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and no had won the trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted

statehood is not the solution for either the us or for puerto rico for economic identity and cultural reasons he pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low and suggests that a different type of mutually-beneficial relationship should be foundif the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities the agreement might cover topics such as the role of the us military in puerto rico the use of the us currency free trade between the two entities and whether puerto ricans would be us citizensthe three current free associated states marshall islands micronesia and palau use the american dollar receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country their citizens are allowed to work in the us and serve in its militarygovernor ricardo rossell is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma  colonialism is not an option  its a civil rights issue  3.5 million citizens seeking an absolute democracy he told the news media benefits of statehood include an additional 10 billion per year in federal funds the right to vote in presidential elections higher social security and medicare benefits and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy the latter is currently prohibitedstatehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection according to the government development bank this might be the only solution to the debt crisis congress has the power to vote to allow chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood but in late 2015 there was very little support in the house for this concept other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and medicaid funding the right to vote in presidential elections and the higher federal minimum wagesubsequent to the 2017 referendum puerto ricos legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal congress in spite of the outcome of the referendum and the so-called tennessee plan above action by the united states congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of puerto rico under the territorial clause of the united states constitutionsince 1953 the un has been considering the political status of puerto rico and how to assist it in achieving independence or decolonization in 1978 the special committee determined that a colonial relationship existed between the us and puerto ricothe uns special committee on decolonization has often referred to puerto rico as a nation in its reports because internationally the people of puerto rico are often considered to be a caribbean nation with their own national identity most recently in a june 2016 report the special committee called for the united states to expedite the process to allow self-determination in puerto rico more specifically the group called on the united states to expedite a process that would allow the people of puerto rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence  allow the puerto rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner and to address their urgent economic and social needs including unemployment marginalization insolvency and povertyon november 27 1953 shortly after the establishment of the commonwealth the general assembly of the united nations approved resolution 748 removing puerto ricos classification as a non-self-governing territory the general assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of puerto ricoaccording to the white house task force on puerto ricos political status in its december 21 2007 report the us in its written submission to the un in 1953 never represented that congress could not change its relationship with puerto rico without the territorys consent it stated that the us justice department in 1959 reiterated that congress held power over puerto rico pursuant to the territorial clause of the us constitutionin 1993 the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit stated that congress may unilaterally repeal the puerto rican constitution or the puerto rican federal relations act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice in a 1996 report on a puerto rico status political bill the us house committee on resources stated puerto ricos current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under resolution 1541" the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as 1 national independence 2 free association based on separate sovereignty or 3 full integration with another nation on the basis of equality the report concluded that puerto rico  remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of free association with the united states as that status is defined under united states law or international practice that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the us congress and that us congress can also withdraw the us citizenship of puerto rican residents of puerto rico at any time for a legitimate federal purpose the application of the us constitution to puerto rico is limited by the insular casesin 2006 2007 2009 2010 and 2011 the united nations special committee on decolonization passed resolutions calling on the united states to expedite a process that would allow puerto ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence and to release all puerto rican

official position is that the us constitution does not contemplate sovereign territories that the court has consistently recognized that there is no sovereignty in a territory of the united states but that of the united states itself and a us territory has no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state that is because the government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the united states congresss plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self-government whereby local officials administer a territorys internal affairson june 9 2016 in

the largest of the greater antillesthe island is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south the main mountain range is called la cordillera central the central range the highest elevation in puerto rico cerro de punta 1,338 meters 4,390ft is located in this rangeanother important peak is el yunque one of the highest in the sierra de luquillo at the el yunque national forest with an elevation of 1,065m 3,494ftpuerto rico has 17 lakes all man-made and more than 50 rivers most originating in the cordillera central rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regionspuerto rico is composed of cretaceous to eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks overlain by younger oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates the oldest rocks are approximately  years old jurassic and are located at sierra bermeja in the southwest part of the island they may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the pacific ocean realmpuerto rico lies at the boundary between the caribbean and north american plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction these stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis these seismic events along with landslides represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern caribbeanthe most recent major earthquake occurred on  1918 and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the richter scale it originated off the coast of aguadilla several kilometers off the northern coast and was accompanied by a tsunami it caused extensive property damage and widespread losses damaging infrastructure especially bridges it resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and 4 million in property damage the failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the puerto rican nationalist partythe

year round averaging near 85f 29c in lower elevations and 70f 21c in the mountains easterly trade winds pass across the island year round puerto rico has a rainy season which stretches from april into november the mountains of the cordillera central are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances the mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the climatic variationthe island has an average temperature of 82.4f 28c throughout the year with an average minimum temperature of 66.9f 19c and maximum of 85.4f 30c daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas the temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than those on the rest of the islandbetween the dry and wet season there is a temperature change of around 6f 3.3c this is mainly due to the warm waters of the tropical atlantic ocean which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest coastal waters temperatures around the years are about 75f 24c in february to 85f 29c in august the highest temperature ever recorded was 99f 37c at arecibo while the lowest temperature ever recorded was 40f 4c in the mountains at adjuntas aibonito

quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones which are more prevalent during periods of la nia than el nio a cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near puerto rico on average every five years a hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island on average every seven years since 1851 the lake okeechobee hurricane of september 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a category 5 hurricanein the busy 2017 atlantic hurricane season puerto rico avoided a direct hit by the category 5 hurricane irma on september 8 2017 but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents almost 50% of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators the category 4 hurricane jose as expected veered away from puerto rico a short time later the devastating hurricane maria made landfall in puerto rico as a category 4 hurricane with sustained 155mph 249kmh winds powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction including the electrical grid which could remain out for 46 months with such widespread destruction and a great need for supplies - everything from drinking water food medicine and personal care items to fuel for generators and construction materials for rebuilding the island - gov rossello and several congressmen called on the federal government to waive the wwi-era jones act protectionist

was 3,474,182 a 6.75% decrease since the 2010 united states census from 2000 to 2010 the population decreased the first such decrease in census history for puerto rico it went from the 3,808,610 residents registered in the 2000 census to 3,725,789 in the 2010 censusa declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society the us census bureaus estimate for july 1 2016 was 3,411,307 people down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3,725,789 peoplecontinuous european immigration and high natural increase helped the population of puerto rico grow from 155,426 in 1800 to almost a million by the close of the 19th centurya census conducted by royal decree on september 30 1858 gave the following totals of the puerto rican population at that time 341,015 were free colored 300,430 identified as whites and 41,736 were slavesduring the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in puerto rico primarily from the canary islands and andalusia but also from other parts of spain such as catalonia asturias galicia and the balearic islands and numerous spanish loyalists from spains former colonies in south america settlers from outside spain also arrived in the islands including from corsica france lebanon china portugal ireland scotland germany and italy this immigration from non-hispanic countries was the result of the real cedula de gracias de 1815 royal decree of graces of 1815" which allowed european catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island provided they paid taxes and continued to support the catholic churchbetween 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in puerto rico did not ask about race or ethnicity the 2000 united states census included a racial self-identification question in puerto rico according to the census most puerto ricans identified as white and hispanic few identified as black or some other racea recent population genetics study conducted in puerto rico suggests that between 52.6% and 84% of the population possess some degree of amerindian mitochondrial dna mtdna in their maternal ancestry usually in a combination with other ancestries such as aboriginal guanche north-west african ancestry brought by spanish settlers from the canary islandsin addition these dna studies show amerindian ancestry in addition to the tanoone genetic study on the racial makeup of puerto ricans including all races found them to be roughly around 61% west eurasiannorth african overwhelmingly of spanish provenance 27% sub-saharan african and 11% native american another genetic study from 2007 claimed that the average genomewide individual ie puerto rican ancestry proportions have been estimated as 66% 18% and 16% for european west african and native american respectively other study estimates 63.7% european 21.2% sub-saharan african and 15.2% native american european ancestry is more prevalent in the west and in central puerto rico african in eastern

79.3 yearspuerto rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100,000 legal residents the vast majority of recent immigrants both legal and illegal come from the dominican republic and haiti other sources sending in significant numbers of recent immigrants include cuba mexico colombia panama jamaica venezuela spain and nigeria also there are many non-puerto rican us citizens settling in puerto rico from the mainland united states and the us virgin islands as well as nuyoricans stateside puerto ricans coming back to puerto rico most recent immigrants settle in and around san juanemigration is a major part of contemporary puerto rican history starting soon after world warii poverty cheap airfares and promotion by the island government caused waves of puerto ricans to move to the united states particularly to the northeastern states and florida this trend continued even as puerto ricos economy improved and its birth rate declined puerto ricans continue to follow a pattern of circular migration with some migrants returning to the island in recent years the population has declined markedly falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% 36,000 people in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigrationaccording to the 2010 census the number of puerto ricans living in the united states outside of puerto rico far exceeds those living in puerto rico emigration exceeds immigration as those who leave tend to be better educated than those that remain this accentuates the drain on puerto ricos economybased on the july 1 2016 estimate by the us census bureau the population of the commonwealth had declined by 314,482 people since the 2010 census data had been tabulatedthe most populous city is the capital san juan with approximately 371,400 people based on a

the us district court for the district of puerto rico is conducted in english english is the primary language of less than 10% of the population spanish is the dominant language of business education and daily life on the island spoken by nearly 95% of the populationthe us census bureaus 2015 update provides the following facts 94.1% of adults speak spanish 5.8% speak only english 78.3% do not speak english very wellin puerto rico public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in spanish there have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in english only objections from teaching staff are common perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in english english is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school the languages of the deaf community are american sign language and its local variant puerto rican sign languagethe spanish of puerto rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the spanish spoken elsewhere as a product of puerto rican history the island possesses a unique spanish dialect puerto rican spanish utilizes many tano words as well as english words the largest influence on the spanish spoken in puerto rico is that of the canary islands the spanish of puerto rico also includes tano words typically in the context of vegetation natural phenomena or primitive musical instruments similarly words attributed to primarily west african languages were adopted in the contexts of foods music or dances particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of sub-saharan africansreligious affiliation 2014the roman catholic church was brought by spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in puerto rico the first dioceses in the americas including that of puerto rico were authorized by pope juliusii in 1511 one pope john paulii visited puerto rico

religious practices associated with different peoples in particular the yoruba beliefs of santera andor if and the kongo-derived palo mayombe some aspects were absorbed into syncretic christianityprotestantism which was suppressed under the spanish catholic regime has slightly reemerged under united states rule making contemporary puerto rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries although catholicism continues to be the dominant religion the first protestant church iglesia de la santsima trinidad was established in ponce by the anglican diocese of antigua in 1872 it was the first non-roman catholic church in the entire spanish empire in the americaspollster pablo ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% roman catholic 28% pentecostal and 18% were members of independent churches which would give a protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined protestants collectively added up to almost two million people another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of protestantspuerto rico by virtue of its long political association with the united states is the most protestant of latin american countries with a protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent the majority of whom are pentecostal david stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 19601985 for another twenty-five years puerto rico will become 75 percent evangelical ana adams brincando el charco in power politics and pentecostals in latin america edward cleary ed 1997 p164the data provided

the new progressive party pnp in spanish and the puerto rican independence party pip the three parties stand for different political status the ppd for example seeks to maintain the islands status with the us as a commonwealth while the pnp on the other hand seeks to make puerto rico a state of the united states the pip in contrast seeks a complete separation from the united states by seeking to make puerto rico a sovereign nation in terms of party strength the ppd and pnp usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the pip holds only about 5%after 2007 other parties emerged on the island the first the puerto ricans for puerto rico party ppr in spanish was registered that same year the party claims that it seeks to address the islands problems from a status-neutral platform but it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election four years later the 2012 election saw the emergence of the movimiento unin soberanista mus english sovereign union movement and the partido del pueblo trabajador ppt english working peoples party but none obtained more than 1% of the voteother non-registered parties include the puerto rican nationalist party the socialist workers movement and the hostosian national independence movementthe insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systemspuerto rico is the only current us possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than american english namely spanish because the us federal government operates primarily in english all puerto rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in english in us federal courts and litigate federal preemption issues in puerto rican courtstitle 48 of the united states code outlines the role of the united states code to united states territories and insular areas such as puerto rico after the us government assumed control of puerto rico in 1901 it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law criminal procedure and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in california although puerto rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the california penal codethe judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the puerto rico supreme court which is the only appellate court required by the constitution all other courts are created by the legislative assembly of puerto rico there is also a federal district court for puerto rico someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a commonwealth court unlike a state court since puerto rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from congress as a state does such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardythe nature of puerto ricos political relationship with the us is the subject of ongoing debate in puerto rico the united states congress and the united nations specifically the basic question is whether puerto rico should remain a us territory become a us state or become an independent countryconstitutionally puerto rico is subject to the plenary powers of the united states congress under the territorial clause of article iv of the us constitution laws enacted at the federal level in the united states apply to puerto rico as well regardless of its political status their residents do not have voting representation in the us congress like the different states of the united states puerto rico lacks the full sovereignty of an independent nation for example the power to manage its external relations with other nations which is held by the us federal government the supreme court of the united states has indicated that once the us constitution has been extended to an area by congress or the courts its coverage is irrevocable to hold that the political branches may switch the constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they not this court say what the law ispuerto ricans were collectively made us citizens in 1917 as a result of the jones-shafroth act us citizens residing in puerto rico cannot vote for the us president though both major parties republican and democratic run primary elections in puerto rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate since puerto rico is an unincorporated territory see above and not a us state the united states constitution does not fully enfranchise us citizens residing in puerto ricoonly fundamental rights under the american federal constitution and adjudications are applied to puerto ricans various other us supreme court decisions have held which rights apply in puerto rico and which ones do not puerto ricans have a long history of service in the us armed forces and since 1917 they have been included in the us compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effectthough the commonwealth government has its own tax laws puerto ricans are also required to pay many kinds of us federal taxes not including the federal personal income tax for puerto rico-sourced income but only under certain circumstances in 2009 puerto rico paid  into the us treasury residents of puerto rico pay into social security and are thus eligible for social security benefits upon retirement they are excluded from the supplemental security income ssi and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the medicaid funding it would receive if it were a us state also medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in puerto rico even though the latter paid fully into the systemwhile a state may try an individual for the same crime heshe was tried in federal court this is not the case in puerto rico being a us territory puerto ricos authority to enact a criminal code derives from congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states thus such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissiblein 1992 president george h w bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the commonwealth of puerto rico this memorandum directs all federal departments agencies and officials to treat puerto rico administratively as if it were a state insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operationsmany federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in puerto rico just as in any state including the federal bureau of investigation federal emergency management agency transportation security administration social security administration and others while puerto rico has its own commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a us state there is also a us federal district court in puerto rico and puerto ricans have served as judges in that court and in other federal courts on the us mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment sonia sotomayor a new yorker of puerto rican descent serves as an associate justice of the supreme court of the united states puerto ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions including serving as united states ambassadors to other nationspuerto rico is subject to the commerce and territorial clause of the constitution of the united states and therefore is restricted on how it can engage with other nations sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one as is the case with state governments regardless it has established several trade agreements with other nations particularly with hispanic american countries such as colombia and panamit has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries all spanish-speaking and within the united states itself which now include spain the dominican republic panama colombia washington dc new york city and florida and has included in the past offices in chile costa rica and mexico such agreements require permission from the us department of state most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the united states and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by puerto rico and different us statesat the local level puerto rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the department of state of puerto rico an executive department headed by the secretary of state of puerto rico who also serves as the territorys lieutenant governor it is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in puerto rico the puerto rico federal affairs administration along with the office of the resident commissioner manage all its intergovernmental

governor of puerto rico who delegates his authority to the puerto rico adjutant general currently colonel marta carcana the adjutant general in turn delegates the authority over the state guard to another officer but retains the authority over the puerto rico national guard as a wholeus military installations in puerto rico were part of the us atlantic command lantcom after 1993 usacom which had authority over all us military operations that took place throughout the atlantic puerto rico had been seen as crucial in supporting lantcoms mission until 1999 when us atlantic command was

fleet air caribbean fair were formerly based at the roosevelt roads naval station the nfc had authority over all us naval activity in the waters of the caribbean while fair had authority over all us

ships that steam by and the only significant military presence in the island is the us army at ft buchanan the puerto rican army and air national guards and the us coast guard protests over the noise

reserve units and the prang puerto rico air national guard muiz air base the c-130 fleet in recent years the us congress has considered their deactivations but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in puerto rico  such as retired military who rely on ft buchanan for the services available therepuerto ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the united states has been involved for example they participated in the american revolution when volunteers from puerto rico cuba and mexico fought the british in 1779 under the command of general bernardo de glvez 17461786 and have continued to participate up to the present-day conflicts in iraq and afghanistana significant number of puerto ricans participate as members and work for the us armed services largely as national guard members and civilian employees the size of the overall military-related community in puerto rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals this includes retired personnel fort buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel in addition approximately 17,000 people are members of the puerto rico army and air national guards or the us reserve forces puerto rican soldiers have served in every us military conflict from world war i to the current military engagement known by the united states and its allies as the war against terrorismthe 65th

for honor and fidelity the 65th infantry regiment participated in world war i world war ii the korean war and the war on terror and in 2014 was awarded the congressional gold medal presented by president barack obama for its heroism during the korean warthere are no counties as there are in the 50 united states there are 78 municipalities municipalities are subdivided into barrios and those into sectors each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four-year termsthe economy of puerto rico is classified as a high income economy by the world bank and as the most competitive economy in latin america by the world economic forum but puerto rico currently has a public debt of 72.204 billion equivalent to 103% of gnp and a government deficit of 2.5 billion according to world bank gross national income per capita of puerto rico in 2013 is 23,830 ppp international dollars ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing primarily pharmaceuticals textiles petrochemicals and electronics followed by the service industry primarily finance insurance real estate and tourism in recent years the territory has also become a popular destination for mice meetings incentives conferencing exhibitions with a modern convention centre district overlooking the port of san juanthe geography of puerto rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity primarily due to its relatively small size as an island its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials and consequently its dependence on imports as well as its territorial status with the united states which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions particularly in its shipping industrypuerto rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011 interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth and entered into recession again in 2013 following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the irs section 936 corporate incentives that the us internal revenue code had applied to puerto rico this irs section was critical to the economy as it established tax exemptions for us corporations that settled in puerto rico and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time without paying federal tax on corporate income puerto rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the worldacademically most of puerto ricos economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired have been repealed or no longer apply to puerto rico its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power as well as its highly inefficient local government which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout timein comparison to the different states of the united states puerto rico is poorer than mississippi the poorest state of the us with 41% of its population below the poverty line when compared to latin america puerto rico has the highest gdp per capita in the region its main trading partners are the united states itself ireland and japan with most products coming from east asia mainly from china hong kong and taiwan at a global scale puerto ricos dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials makes puerto rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate puerto ricos agricultural sector represents less than 1% of gnpin early 2017 the puerto rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to 70 billion at a time with a 45 percent poverty rate and 12.4% unemployment that is more than twice the mainland us average the debt had been increasing during a decade long recessionthe commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts including bonds since 2015 with debt payments due the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system without action before april puerto ricos ability to execute contracts for fiscal year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened thereby putting at risk beginning july 1 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor us citizens living in puerto rico according to a letter sent to congress by the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of health and human services they also said that congress must enact measures recommended by both republicans and democrats that fix puerto ricos inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growthinitially the oversight board created under promesa called for puerto ricos governor ricardo rossell to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by january 28 just before that deadline the control board gave the commonwealth government until february 28 to present a fiscal plan including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt to solve the problems a moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to may 31 it is essential for puerto rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under promesa an internal survey conducted by the puerto rican economists association revealed that the majority of puerto rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the board and the rossell government with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debtin early august 2017 the islands financial oversight board created by promesa planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees down from the original plan of four days per month the latter had been expected to achieve 218 million in savings governor rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the 50 billion in unfunded pension liabilitiespuerto rico has an operating budget of about us9.8 billion with expenses at about 10.4 billion creating a structural deficit of 775 million about 7.9% of the budget the practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for 17 consecutive years starting in 2000 throughout those years including present time all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover said projected deficits rather than make proper adjustments this practice eroded puerto ricos treasury as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades since 1973projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of 71b or about 70% of puerto ricos gross domestic product this sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after puerto ricos general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade junk status by three credit rating agencies in terms of financial control almost 9.6%or about 1.5 billionof puerto ricos central government budget expenses for fy2014 is expected to be spent on debt service harsher budget cuts are expected as puerto rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the following yearsfor practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects a general budget which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the department of treasury of puerto rico and the consolidated budget which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget by puerto ricos government-owned corporations by revenue expected from loans by the sale of government bonds by subsidies extended by the federal government of the united states and by other fundsboth budgets contrast each other drastically with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget currently 29b and 9.0b respectively almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from us federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budgetthe critical aspects come from the sale of bonds which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget a ratio that increased annually due to the governments inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses in particular the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt as not a single one is self-sufficient all of them carrying extremely inefficient operations for example in fy2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than 1.3b with the puerto rico highways and transportation authority prhta reporting losses of 409m the puerto rico electric power authority prepa the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island reporting losses of 272m while the puerto rico aqueducts and sewers authority prasa the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island reported losses of 112mlosses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of puerto ricos entire public debt today holistically from fy2000fy2010 puerto ricos debt grew at a compound annual growth rate cagr of 9% while gdp remained stagnant this has not always provided a long-term solution in early july 2017 for example the prepa power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure 9 billion in bond debt the agency planned to seek court protectionin terms of protocol the governor together with the puerto rico office of management and budget ogp in spanish formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year he then submits this formulation as a budget request to the puerto rican legislature before july 1 the date established by law as the beginning of puerto ricos fiscal year while the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted at the beginning of each regular session the request is typically submitted during the first week of may as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in january and it would be unpractical to submit a request so far ahead once submitted the budget is then approved by the legislature typically with amendments through a joint resolution and referred back to the governor for his approval the governor then either approves it or vetoes it if vetoed the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governors approval or approve it without the governors consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamberonce approved the department of treasury disburses funds to the office of management and budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies all while the puerto rico government development bank the governments intergovernmental bank manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporationsthe cost of living in puerto rico is high and has increased over the past decade san juans in particular is higher than atlanta dallas and seattle but lower than boston chicago and new york city one factor is housing prices which are comparable to miami and los angeles although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the united statesstatistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs such as the high cost of electricity which has hovered in the 24 to 30 range per kilowatthour two to three times the national average increased travel costs for longer flights additional shipping fees and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers outside the continental united states while some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to puerto rico many merchants exclude hawaii alaska puerto rico and other united states territoriesthe household median income is stated as 19,350 and the mean income as 30,463 in the us census bureaus 2015 update the report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level the median home value in puerto rico ranges from us100,000 to us214,000 while the national median home value sits at 119,600one of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in puerto rico is the merchant marine act of 1920 also known as the jones act which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two american ports a practice known as cabotage because of the jones act foreign ships inbound with goods from central and south america western europe and africa cannot stop in puerto rico offload puerto rico-bound goods load mainland-bound puerto rico-manufactured goods and continue to us ports instead they must proceed directly to us ports where distributors break bulk and send puerto rico-bound manufactured goods to puerto rico across the ocean by us-flagged shipsthe local government of puerto rico has requested several times to the us congress to exclude puerto rico from the jones act restrictions without success the most recent measure has been taken by the 17th legislative assembly of puerto rico through r conc del s 21 these measures have always received support from all the major local political partiesin 2013 the government accountability office published a report which concluded that repealing or amending the jones act cabotage law might cut puerto rico shipping costs and that shippers believed that opening the trade to non-us-flag competition could lower costs however the same gao report also found that shippers doing business in puerto rico that gao contacted reported that the freight rates are oftenalthough not alwayslower for foreign carriers going to and from puerto rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the united states despite longer distances data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred ultimately the report concluded that the effects of modifying the application of the jones act for puerto rico are highly uncertain for both puerto rico and the united states particularly for the us shipping industry and the military preparedness of the united statesthe first school in puerto rico was the escuela de gramtica grammar school it was established by bishop alonso manso in 1513 in the area where the cathedral of san juan was to be constructed the school was free of charge and the courses taught were

caribbean sea coast it is a blend of wood and masonry incorporating architectural elements of other styles from classical revival and spanish revival to victorianpuerto rican art reflects many influences much from its ethnically diverse background a form of folk art called santos evolved from the catholic churchs use of sculptures to convert indigenous puerto ricans to christianity santos depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood clay and stone after shaping simple they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors santos vary in size with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall traditionally santos were seen as messengers between the earth and heaven as such they occupied a special place on household altars where people prayed to them asked for help or tried to summon their protectionalso popular caretas or vejigantes are masks worn during carnivals similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both spain and africa though for different purposes the spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed christians into returning to the church while tribal africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented true to their historic origins puerto rican caretas always bear at least several horns and fangs while usually constructed of papier-mch coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well red and black were the typical colors for caretas but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patternspuerto
