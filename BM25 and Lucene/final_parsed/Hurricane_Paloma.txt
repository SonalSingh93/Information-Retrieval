hurricane paloma  wikipedia hurricane paloma spanish  was the third-strongest november atlantic hurricane on record it was the sixteenth tropical storm eighth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season a late season hurricane it set several records for its intensity and formation paloma was the third most powerful november hurricane on record in the atlantic basin behind only a 1932 hurricane and 1999's lenny it also marked the first time that at least one major hurricane formed in every month of the hurricane season from july to november with only june not having a major hurricane this seasonpaloma developed out of a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern coast of nicaragua and northern coast of honduras on november 5 the disturbance had slowly developed into a tropical depression while hugging the coastline the depression strengthened into a tropical storm early on november 6 then a hurricane later that day the next day paloma intensified into a category 2 hurricane then soon a category 3 early on november 8 paloma continued to intensify and reached category 4 intensity and then weakened rapidly into a category 2 before making landfall in santa cruz del sur cuba paloma weakened into a tropical storm on november 9 while moving over cuba where it stalled out it dissipated later that evening hurricane paloma caused heavy damage in both the cayman islands and cuba damages in the caymans amounted to 154.4million usd and damage in cuba totaled to 300million and 100,000 in damage to jamaica for a total of 454.5 million with one fatalityin early november2008 an area of disturbed weather persisted over the southwestern caribbean sea by november2 a surface trough manifested itself spurring the development of scattered convection shower and thunderstorm activity across the region a tropical wave approaching from the east interacted with this trough two days later and enhanced convective organization steadily consolidating the system developed into a tropical depression by 18:00utc on november5 while located 130mi 215km southeast of the nicaraguahonduras border situated along the southwestern edge of a ridge the depressed initially generally to the north-northwest before turning north-northeast within 12hours of formation favorable environmental conditions including low wind shear allowed for steady intensification following cyclogenesis the hwrf and gfdl forecast models depicted rapid development of the depression into a major hurricane within five days before striking cuba the former of which indicated a peak intensity of 131mph 211kmh and 921mbar hpa 27.20inhg the system acquired gale-force winds early on november6 at which time it was assigned the name paloma aided by good upper-level outflow deep convection blossomed over the storms circulation further development of banding features and eye resulted in paloma rapidly intensifying into a hurricane by 00:00utc on november7the initial phase of rapid intensification temporarily abated on november7 though slow strengthening continued once its eye became defined on visible satellite imagery that evening rapid strengthening ensued once more a localized area of high ocean heat content bolstered this phase aided by increasing divergence from an approaching upper-level trough palomas outflow greatly enhanced overnight the aforementioned trough imparted a slightly more northeasterly track on the hurricane around 09:00utc on november8 the hurricane skirted little cayman as a category3 rapid intensification continued through the first half of the day with paloma reaching category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale around 10:30utc the first such november system since hurricane michelle in 2001 around this time the storms center passed over cayman brac and little cayman shortly thereafter an unofficial anemometer on cayman brac at an elevation of 240ft 73m measured sustained winds of 151mph 243kmh based on data from reconnaissance aircraft which found flight-level winds 163mph 262kmh paloma peaked with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 145mph 230kmh at 12:0018:00utc along with a minimum barometric pressure of 944mbar hpa 27.88inhg this ranked the system as the third-strongest november hurricane on record only behind the 1932 santa cruz del sur hurricane and hurricane lenny in 1999 additionally this marked the first time that major hurricanes developed in five separate months during a single year with bertha gustav ike and omar reaching this strength in july august september and october respectively at its peak paloma displayed a well-defined eye surrounded by intense convection estimated at 70 to 80c 94 to 112flate on november8 environmental conditions abruptly became hostile as the hurricane approached cuba interaction with land hastened palomas weakening with convection diminishing significantly the northern eyewall moved ashore around 23:00utc while the center itself made landfall at 01:00utc on november9 near santa cruz del sur upon moving ashore paloma was estimated to have had winds of 100mph 155kmh making it a category2 within hours of moving ashore the center decoupled from the remaining convection and its forward speed slowed significantly the system subsequently degraded to a tropical depression by 18:00utc just 24hours after being a category4 with no convection redeveloping as the system drifted northward over cuba paloma degenerated into a remnant low six hours later the low then briefly moved over the atlantic ocean before doubling back to the southwest in response to a building ridge farther north the system crossed cuba again and re-emerged over the caribbean sea by november12 changing direction this time to the west and later northwest after crossing western cuba early on november13 the remnants of paloma entered the gulf of mexico accelerating northward the low became decreasingly organized and ultimately dissipated early the next day about 70mi 110km south-southwest of apalachicola florida later on november14 the system moved inland over the florida panhandle where a sudden burst of convective development akin to that of supercell thunderstorms over the great plains took place thereafter energy from paloma may have contributed to a deadly tornado outbreak in the carolinas on november15at 15:00utc on november6 the government of the cayman islands issued a hurricane watch for all of the territorys islands this was superseded six hours later by a hurricane warning the warning was eventually discontinued early on november9 once paloma cleared the islands on november7 the red cross opened a shelter for possible evacuees while stocks of emergency supplies were checked schools businesses and government offices closed for november8 shelters opened on grand cayman closed their doors by mid-afternoon in advance of palomas arrival to ensure that persons get off the roads at least 40people sought refuge in these shelters prior to the storms arrival the seamans center a government office building was utilized as an unofficial shelter during the storm and housed at least 100people the cayman islands government requested all hotels to move guests on ground and first floors to higher rooms as a precautionary measure water service was turned off during the evening on november8 the british ship rfa wave ruler was sent to little cayman and cayman brac for humanitarian assistance on the order of governor stuart jackanticipating hurricane conditions to impact portions of eastern cuba the nations government issued a hurricane watch for the provinces of camagey ciego de vila granma las tunas and sancti spritus at 12:00utc on november7 six hours later this was upgraded to a hurricane warning except and by the november8 warnings covered the entirety of eastern cuba these advisories were discontinued following palomas rapid dissipation over land on november9fearing a potentially catastrophic storm with a storm surge of 20 to 25ft 6.1 to 7.6m officials in cuba scrambled to evacuate nearly half a million people in southern areas of the country coincidentally paloma threatened the same area where a devastating hurricane in 1932 killed more than 3,000people almost exactly 76years prior plans were put in place to evacuate 345,000 in holgun 324,000 in granma 250,000people in las tunas and 200,000 in camagey an estimated 3,000tourists in ciego de avila were brought to shelters ultimately an approximate 1.2million people 10.7% of cubas entire population were relocated in advance of the storms arrival of these people 220,000sought refuge in 1,448shelters while the rest stayed with relatives a total of 927food processing centers and 72soup kitchens opened to feed evacuees roughly 237,000animals were moved to safer areas holgun province was devastated by hurricane ike in september with many residents still homeless at the time of palomas approach all domestic flights except those around the isle of youth former president fidel castro urged people to remain positive in the face of yet another hurricane that year he also issued a written statement to the united states rejecting any aid citing anger toward the ongoing embargo of cuba before a formal offer was even made the non-profit organization operation usa provided emergency aid to cubafollowing the classification of tropical depression seventeen late on november5 a tropical storm watch was issued for coastal areas between puerto cabezas nicaragua and limon honduras this later expired on november6 as paloma moved away from the region owing to the threat of heavy rains in honduras a red alert was issued for coln gracias a dios northern olancho and the bay islandsalthough paloma was not forecast to directly impact jamaica officials opened 15 priority shelters in st james and all agencies were placed under high-alert on november8 a flash flood warning was in place from november69 for the entire islandearly on november8 a tropical storm watch and later tropical storm warning was issued for the central bahamas including cat island exuma long island rum cay san salvador crooked island acklins and ragged island accordingly the national emergency operations centre was partially activated the warning was allowed to expire the following day as paloma rapidly weakened over cuba and the national emergency operations centre issued an all clear on november10throughout much of october central america was plagued by a series of heavy rain events which resulted in widespread damage and loss of life the outer bands of then tropical storm paloma exacerbated the situation in parts of honduras and nicaragua estimates from the tropical rainfall measuring mission satellites indicated that paloma dropped upwards of 8in 200mm of rain along coastal areas the overall impacts of flooding since october in honduras left at least 60people dead and more than 300,000 in need of assistancepassing directly over the small islands cayman brac and little cayman with a collective population of 2,695 hurricane paloma wrought tremendous damage grand cayman escaped almost entirely unscathed throughout the cayman islands paloma was responsible for 154.4million in losses of which 124.5million was incurred from damage this equates to roughly 7.4percent of the territorys gross domestic product gdp while the overall impact to the islands was offset by a lack of damage on grand cayman the localized losses on cayman brac and little cayman were tremendous discounting the economy of grand cayman the equivalent gdp losses on the two smaller islands was likely similar to that of hurricane ivan in 2004 which left damage equal to 183percent of the territorys gdp the overall per capita impact there reached 57,925 despite the severity of damage no loss of life or injuries took placedestructive winds and torrential rains battered both cayman brac and little cayman with an unofficial elevated observation station reporting maximum sustained winds of 151mph 243kmh during the height of the storm grand cayman saw lesser winds with a peak sustained observation of 60mph 97kmh at owen roberts international airport precipitation on cayman brac amounted to 17.77in 451mm and 6.05in 154mm on grand cayman a significant storm surge also impacted the islands reaching 8ft 2.4m on cayman brac and 4ft 1.2m on little caymandestructive winds were the primary cause of damage across cayman brac and little cayman where nearly all homes were affected cayman brac sustained the most severe impact with 71homes destroyed and 912damaged although all home on little cayman were affected none experienced major damage bodden town was the only district on grand cayman reporting damage with 11homes affected major damage took place at cayman bracs seaport the ports warehouse and office building were destroyed while anchors and moorings were shifted out of position the islands fire station and faith hospital had major roof damage with the latter resulting in significant water damage to equipment the roof of the seamans center later determined to have been inadequately built collapsed during the storm and nearly injured people sheltering within it all schools on cayman brac suffered moderate to major damage while the primary school on little cayman experienced minor damagethe electrical grid sustained major damage with all residents on cayman brac and little cayman losing service roughly 400power poles fell during the storm telecommunications experienced similar damage with landline services disrupted for two to three weeks six of the ten affected digicel sites went down effects on the water supply was negligible with only a few pipes damaged by uprooted trees major crop damage took place on grand cayman primarily to bananas plantains and peppers due to high windsflooding was reported in parts of jamaica as a result of the outer bands of paloma one person drowned in clarendon parish while crossing a flooded river severe flooding also destroyed crops in 100 farms causing over 100,000 in damages in st catherine several inches of rain caused flooding in bog walk gorge which inundated several homes and stranded at least 15 people numerous vehicles were washed away in the floodshurricane paloma was the final tropical cyclone to impact cuba during the destructive 2008season preceded by fay gustav hanna and ike paloma compounded damage sustained by the nation the 2008 season is regarded as the most destructive in cuban history primarily due to the effects of gustav and ike total damage from hurricanes that year amounted to 9.4billioncuban utility officials say palomas effect on the power grid was not as bad as the destruction caused by gustav and ike earlier in the season paloma did however knock down power and telephone lines as well as a major communications tower the hurricane brought with it a 14-foot 4 meter storm surge which moved the coastline inland by almost a mile about 1.5km in santa cruz del sur doing extensive damagein santa cruz del sur where paloma came ashore 435 homes were torn to shreds the sea swept more than a mile inland the wind and waves left wooden houses in splinters topped with seaweed two of the two-story concrete walls of a factory crumbled into piles of rubble smashing 57 wooden fishing boats stored inside for safekeeping an estimated 328 hectares of crops were destroyed by the storm most of which were in the process of recovery following hurricane ike a total of 8,000 homes in santa cruz were damaged and another 670 in camaguey and las tunas about 7,000 farmers and 4,700 residences were isolated by floodwaters overall damages in cuba totaled to 300 millionafter tracking through the gulf of mexico the remnants of paloma reached the florida panhandle on november14 shortly before crossing the coastline convection suddenly and explosively developed contributing to a swath of heavy rains the highest amount was recorded in bloxham at 9.25 inches 235mm which contributed to flash flooding unofficial radar observations indicated rainfall totals up to 14 inches 360mm the torrential rains marked the highest rainfall for november14 in the state of florida flood waters south of tallahassee reached 2 feet 0.61m in places stranding vehicles one person was trapped by flood waters but was rescued without injuryowing to the hurricanes destructive effects in the cayman islands and cuba the world meteorological organization retired the name paloma in the spring of 2009 and replaced it with paulette the name will never again be used for another atlantic hurricanelocal groups in the cayman islands set up funds following hurricane paloma by march3 2009 one group raised 120,000 in relief funds and received another 20,000 in donations following the storm the british red cross released 15,000 us23,500 in emergency funds the government of the cayman islands and the adventist disaster response agency distributed basic relief items such as tarpaulins hygiene items and buckets to victims of the stormthe overall impacts from hurricane paloma were reflected in the territorys gdp by a 0.9percent decrease worth 33million in the expected growth for 2008 total revenue fell by 11.6million while expenditures rose by 28.2million strain on the economy prompted inflation to rise slightly above 5.2percent for the year as wellbetween november18 and december13 675tons of debris was collected which covered an area of 21acres by 12ft 3.7m tallalready severely impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike the european commission through its humanitarian aid department was already providing 2 million us2.7million in relief aid by november21 about 6,000 volunteers from the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies were in cuba assisting in cleanup efforts and helping victims in shelters the organization also allocated us8.8million in relief funds for 60,000 people affected by paloma
