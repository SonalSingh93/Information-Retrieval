hurricane georges  wikipedia hurricane georges  was a powerful and long-lived cape verde-type category 4 hurricane which caused severe destruction as it traversed the caribbean and gulf of mexico in september 1998 making eight landfalls along its path georges was the seventh tropical storm fourth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1998 atlantic hurricane season it became the most destructive storm of the season and the costliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane andrew in 1992 and the deadliest since hurricane gordon in 1994 georges killed 604people mainly on the island of hispaniola and caused extensive damage resulting at just under 10billion 1998 us dollars equivalent to 17billion in 2016 in damages mostly in st kitts and nevis puerto rico and hispaniolathe hurricane made landfall in at least seven different countries antigua and barbuda st kitts and nevis haiti the dominican republic cuba and the united states and puerto rico a territory of the united statesmore than any other hurricane since hurricane inez of the 1966 seasona tropical wave exited the coast of africa on september 13 moving westward the large system quickly developed a closed circulation and was classified tropical depression seven on september 15 a strong upper-level ridge forced the depression to the west-northwest where warm water temperatures allowed it to strengthen to a tropical storm on september 16 georgess circulation developed strong banding features around a well-organized central dense overcast and with the aid of a developing anti-cyclone georges attained hurricane status late on september 17conditions became nearly ideal for continued development including warm water temperatures low-level inflow to the hurricanes north and good upper-level outflow a banding eye developed and georges reached major hurricane strength on september 19 while 675mi 1085km east-southeast of guadeloupe by september 19 an upper-level anticyclone was well established over georges and satellite pictures suggested that the hurricane was beginning to strengthen rapidly as indicated by the cooling cloud tops increased symmetry of the deep convection and the warming and contracting of the well-defined 40mi 63km wide eye as rapid intensification continued and georges peaked at a very dangerous category 4 storm with 155mph 250kmh wind and a 937 minimal pressure late on september 19 and early september 20 at that time georges was the most intense strongest storm since hurricane hugo and alongside hurricane luis it is one of the largest major hurricanes in the atlantic with hurricane force windfields extending more than 150mi 250km from the center and with a more than 300mi 490km wide tropical storm force windfield shortly after peaking upper-level wind shear from the development of an upper-level low weakened the hurricane on september 20 in the afternoon as the central pressure had risen 26 mb as georges approached the leeward islandson september 21 after weakening considerably category 3 georges made landfall directly on antigua and three hours later in st kitts though its 175 mi 280km wide tropical storm force windfield affected all the leeward islands after weakening to a category 2 hurricane over the caribbean upper-level shear decreased and georges strengthened a bit before making landfall near fajardo puerto rico as a 115mph 175kmh category 3 hurricane early in the morning over the mountainous terrain of the island the hurricane weakened again but over the mona passage it again re-intensified to hit eastern dominican republic with winds of 120mph 195kmh on september 22 like in puerto rico georges was greatly weakened by the mountainous terrain and after crossing the windward passage it struck 30mi 48km east of guantnamo bay cuba on september 23 well-defined upper-level outflow allowed the hurricane to remain well organized and while paralleling the northern coastline of the island georges retained minimal hurricane statushurricane georges reached the straits of florida on september 24 and as it had done earlier in its lifetime quickly restrengthened to category2 status on the september 25 due to warm water temperatures and little upper-level shear it continued to the west-northwest and struck key west later on september 25 with winds of 105mph 165kmh despite moving over warmer water georges only managed to peak at 110mph 175kmh in the gulf of mexico likely due to its disrupted inner core a mid-tropospheric anticyclone pushed the hurricane slowly north-northwestward forcing georges to make its seventh and final landfall near biloxi mississippi on september 28 within 24hours georges had weakened to a tropical depression and due to weak steering currents the storm looped over southern mississippi then drifted to the east the weak circulation moved eastward over the interior of the florida panhandle and dissipated on october 1 near the floridageorgia borderlate on september18 a hurricane watch was issued for saint lucia anguilla saba and sint maarten it was extended to include the british and united states virgin islands on the following day later on september19 a hurricane warning was put into effect for islands between dominica and anguilla as well as saint martin but excluding saint barthlemy early on the following day a tropical storm warning was issued for saint lucia and martinique about six hours later the hurricane warning issued on september19 was extended on september20 to include islands north and west of dominica until puerto rico simultaneously the tropical storm warning in effect for saint lucia and martinique was discontinued by later on september21 the hurricane warning was canceled for all islands east of the virgin islands including antigua barbuda st barthelemy st martin at 0300utc on the following day the hurricane warning was extended to include the british and united states virgin islands though six hours later it was also discontinuedseveral hundred people on the island of montserrat went into twelve hurricane shelters as georges passed by with winds of 110mph 175kmh on september18 the national disaster preparedness committee in dominica began meetings to prepare for possible impacts from georges residents began stocking up on supplies by this time for the following two days the island was placed under a state of high-alert as direct impact from a category 4 hurricane was anticipated by the following morning most businesses had boarded up their windows and roads were quiet officials declared that schools would be closed on september21 and shelters across the island were openedbeginning at 21:00utc on september21 with a hurricane watch for puerto rico the nhc and national governments in the greater antilles and the bahamas issued a number of tropical cyclone watches and warnings in anticipation of the hurricane as the storm progressed across the islands the warnings were gradually canceled until the government of cuba discontinued a hurricane watch at 03:00utc on september26in the days prior to the hurricanes arrival thousands of citizens in the leeward islands and puerto rico prepared for the major hurricane by boarding windows and purchasing supplies puerto rican governor pedro rossell activated the islands national guard opened 416shelters and enacted a temporary prohibition on alcohol sales more than 28,000people across the island evacuated their homes to the shelters in the northern portion of the island both the federal emergency management agency fema and the american red cross deployed workers there with supplies for a potentially deadly eventdue to initial forecasts of the hurricane brushing the northern portion of the country the dominican republic was caught off guard instead like in puerto rico georges traversed the entire country and passed close to santo domingo neighboring haiti expected the worst opening shelters and evacuating vulnerable people from low-lying coastal areasprior to making landfall more than 200,000people were evacuated from coastal areas in eastern cuba in the potentially impacted area cubas revolutionary army was sent to farm lands to harvest crops that could be destroyed during the storm members of the cuban government travelled door-to-door to alert everyone of the hurricane in addition to this president fidel castro spoke live on national television to explain the countrys plans to withstand the hurricane as well as ensuring a quick recovery effort by using all of the nations resourcesinitial forecasts of a southeastern florida landfall forced over 1.2million to evacuate including much of the florida keys despite the mandatory evacuation order 20,000people including over 7,000key west citizens refused to leave some of those who remained to ride out the storm were shrimpers whose boats were their entire livelihood insurance companies refused to insure some of the older shrimp boats leading shrimpers to ride it out with all they had left due to lack of law enforcement those who stayed in key west went through red lights double-parked and disobeyed traffic laws long-time florida keys citizens noted the solitude of the time and enjoyed the island for how it once was rather than the large crowds of touristsin the northern gulf of mexico georges was forecast to attain major hurricane status and make landfall in southeastern louisiana because of this portions of the state were evacuated including new orleans there the louisiana superdome was for the first time in its history used as a refuge of last resort for those unable to evacuate new orleans more than 14,000citizens rode out the storm in the facility causing difficulties to supply necessities the building had no problems related to the weather though evacuees looted the building stole furniture and damaged property however the damage was much less than in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in 2005 many citizens in southern mississippi were told to leave due to a mandatory or recommended evacuation of those in the evacuation area 60% actually left most of those who stayed remained because they believed their house was safe enough for the storm of those who left most went to a relatives house in their own county prior to making landfall georgess track was very uncertain this forced for the mandatory evacuations of alabamas two coastal counties baldwin and mobile counties with a combined population of over 500,000people despite the order only 67% of the area actually left to a safer place most of those who remained stayed because they believed their house would be able to withstand the hurricane the majority of those who did leave went to a relatives house in a safer portion of the state in the days before making landfall only 22% of the population in recommended evacuation areas along the florida panhandle actually left however most of them were prepared to leave if the situation became worse those who did leave were concerned about the severity of the storm while those who stayed felt their home was safe enough for the hurricanes effects floridians who evacuated typically left for a friend or relatives house and only went to another area of their countya large and long-lasting hurricane hurricane georges brought torrential rainfall and mudslides along much of its path through the greater antilles in all the hurricane caused 9.72billion in damage and 604fatalities in the two months after georgess final landfall the american red cross spent 104million on relief aid through puerto rico the united states virgin islands florida louisiana alabama and mississippi making georges the costliest disaster aid in the programs 125-year historyupon moving through the leeward islands georges brought strong winds and heavy rainfall amounting to a maximum of 7.5inches 190mm at st johnin antigua strong winds caused severe property damage mostly caused to roofs 1020% of houses were greatly impacted including three schools high winds during the passage of the hurricane downed telephone and power lines causing loss of communication and power across much of the island an unofficial wind observation from antigua reported winds at 94mph with gusts to 116mph between barbuda and antigua georges killed 3 people left 3,800 homeless and resulting at 160 million damagethe weakening hurricane spared the island as it passed 25 miles 40km to the north causing moderate damage houses and roofs uprooted trees power lines and outages beach erosion especially in grande-terre in basse-terre minor to moderate damage was common the worst damage was to the banana crops 85% to 100% devastated with a cost of 100 millions of francs 22 millions usd the maximal rainfall was 5 to 6inches in this areathe met office in desirade east of guadeloupe had a 75 miles per hour 121kmh wind and a 88 miles per hour 142kmh sustained gust in raizet they experienced a 42 miles per hour 68kmh wind and a maximal gust 66 miles per hour 106kmh the minimal pressure fell to 1000 mb 29.54 ihg for several hoursmto france forecast 1224 hours before a 65mph winds with gust near 100mph and a minimal pressure around 980 mb meaning the worst has been avoidafter passing through antigua georges produced strong winds of up to 115mph 185kmh while passing over st kitts georges caused catastrophic damage downing power lines telephone lines and trees across the island lack of electricity resulted in damage to water facilities as well georgess high winds caused extensive property damage damaging 8085% of the houses on the island and destroying 2025% of homes many schools businesses hospitals and government buildings lost their roofs while the airport experienced severe damage to its main terminal and control tower limiting flights to the daytime st kitts economy was disrupted from severe agricultural losses including the devastation of 50% of their sugar crop in addition damaged hotels and piers created a long-term impact through lack of tourisman industry the island relies on in all hurricane georges caused 5fatalities left 3,000homeless and resulted in 458million 1998usd in damage on the islandin the other part of the country nevis fared better like on st kitts high winds downed power and telephone lines damaging the water system there 35% of homes on the island were damaged though none were destroyed rainfall and debris killed several hundred livestock and seriously damaged coconut trees amounting to 2.5million 1998usd in agricultural damage there were no casualties reported on the island and damaged amounted to 39million 1998usddamage in st kitts totaled ec1.2billion us458 million total damage on nevis amounted to 39million the total damage from the storm was nearly twice the countrys gross domestic product of us271millionno major damage was reported to public buildings in the british virgin islands some of the islands homes had roofs blown off the environment suffered major damage there were many reports of eroded soil in areas where construction was in progress some of the soils were planted on roads in mangrove farms and in the sea which could have potentially killed sea life national parks around the islands suffered minor damage except for queen elizabeth park which had many fallen trees none of the schools in the area suffered any damage and opened again four days after georges had passed there were no fatalities in the islands and one minor injury was reported there was no major damage to the islands medical buildings pipe damage was found in two areas but there was no damage to the sewage systems the total damage in the british virgin islands was valued at us9.404 millionas georges moved through the northern end of the lesser antilles it produced significant rainfall and strong winds over the united states virgin islands maximum rainfalls reached 6.79 inches 172mm at the airport in st croix and 5.26 inches 134mm at st thomas airport the strongest sustained winds and gusts were recorded on st croix as well measuring 74mph 119kmh and 91mph 146kmh respectively a total of 20 homes were destroyed and 50 others sustained damage most of the losses were confined to agriculture and livestock fifty-five boats were sunk across the islands several power lines were downed throughout st croix by high winds leaving some residences without power however compared to the intensity of georges during its passage of the islands relatively few people 15% of the islands customers lost power this was due to the improved power grid set up across the island for this type of event total losses on the island were estimated at 2million 1998 usdin other nearby islands georges impact was relatively minor to moderate power outages flooding and minor to moderate structural damage was commongeorges was the first hurricane to cross the entire island of puerto rico since the san ciprian hurricane in 1932 the hurricane brought storm surge peaking at an estimated 10-ft 3m in height in fajardo along with tides up to 20ft 6m above normal the hurricane spawned two f2 tornadoes on the island though they caused little damage georges dropped immense precipitation in the mountain regions peaking at 30.51in 775mm in jayuya with many other locations reporting at least 1ft 300mm of precipitation hurricane-force winds were observed throughout the island sustained winds and gusts reached 87mph 140kmh and 107mph 172kmh respectively at the roosevelt roads naval station in ceiba unofficially a sustained wind speed of 102mph 164kmh and a gust of 164mph 264kmh were observed in isabelathe mountain flooding drained off in the islands rivers causing every river to overflow its banks near the coast the surfeit of water carved new channels from the record discharge rate the storms strong winds caused beach erosion in many places along the coastline eroded beaches flooding and debris left many roads impassable or destroyed isolating some areas on the western portion of the island georgess deluge of rainfall caused significant damage to the agricultural industry including the loss of 75% of its coffee crop 95% of its banana or plantain crop and 65% of its live poultryits large circulation brought fierce winds to the entire island damaging 72,605houses and destroying 28,005others this left tens of thousands homeless after the storms passage over 22,000people were sheltered in 139shelters in cities throughout the island all shelters experienced power outages and after the storm passed through lack of water and sewer systems became a serious problem high winds downed nearly half of the islands electric and telephone lines leaving 96% of the population powerless and 8.4% of telephone customers without service lack of electricity greatly damaged the water system resulting in the loss of water and sewer service for 75% of the island in the nearby small island of culebra georges destroyed 74houses and damaged 89others although damage estimates are not available therein all georges caused 3.6billion in damage and there were no direct casualties due to well-executed warnings however georges indirectly caused eight deaths in puerto rico two deaths occurred due to carbon monoxide poisoning from operating a gasoline-powered generator indoors while two other people were hospitalized for the same issue four other fatalities occurred after a lit candle started a house fire additionally there was one death each from head trauma and electrocution in the aftermath of the hurricanethough there are no recorded amounts satellite-derived rainfall estimates show up to 39inches 990mm of rain falling in the mountainous terrain of the countries this heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides and flooding killing a total of 589people across the island and leaving more than 350.000 homelessin the dominican republic georges brought strong winds and very heavy rains along with a 7-foot 2m storm surge nearly 10 hours of continuous rainfall resulted in mudslides and overflown rivers across the mountainous country damaging many cities along the southern coastline including the capital 120mph 193kmh winds downed and uprooted trees across much of the country littering streets with debris and mud thousands of houses were destroyed while many were completely destroyed from the flooding and winds the entire country was without electricity during the aftermath of the storm damaging water and communication systems heavy wind damage and flooding caused extensive damage to the airport in santo domingo restricting usage to military and non-commercial flightsmost impacted by hurricane georges was the agricultural industry the areas hardest hit by the hurricane coincided with the countrys main crop-growing areas including the provinces around santo domingo after a severe drought in 1997 extreme rainfall damaged around 470,000 acres 190,202ha of food crops including various types of vegetables fruits and roots some of the countrys main diet food substantial amounts of tobacco and sugar plantations the countrys most important export crop were severely damaged the extreme flooding caused great losses in the poultry industry an important economy in the area the dominican republic had to import significant amounts of rice and other crops to compensate for the lossesdeath toll reports were slow in the wake of the storm but a total of 380people died from hurricane georges damage in the dominican republic amounted to 1.2billion 1998usd 1.8billion 2009usdupon reaching haiti georges was a weakened hurricane but it still brought heavy rainfall across the entire country the capital city of port-au-prince was largely unharmed with the exception of flooding in low-lying coastal areas damaging the main commercial port the rest of the country however experienced a significant number of mudslides due to deforestation along the mountains these mudslides destroyed or severely damaged many houses leaving 167,332homeless damage was greatest along the northern coastline from cap-hatien to gonaves due to the flooding and mudslides on the southern coast the head of a us-based medical team stranded for several days by flooding in the remote town of belle anse anticipated a rise in malnutrition disease homelessness and poverty lack of electricity led to a total disruption of haitis water supply system causing a decrease in sanitary conditions across the poorest country in the western hemisphere in all 209people died in haitilike in the dominican republic the agricultural sector suffered extreme damage after a severe drought in 1997 georgess severe flooding stopped any chances of recovering quickly most of the countrys significant crop land including artibonite valley suffered total losses up to 80% of banana plantations were lost while vegetable roots tubers and other food crops were ruined in addition thousands of small farm animals were either killed or lost total agricultural losses amounted to 179million 1998usd 250million 2009usd the country requested food assistance in the aftermath of the hurricane to alleviate the serious lossesupon making landfall hurricane georges produced torrential rainfall amounting to a maximum of 24.41inches 620mm at limonar in the province of guantnamo several other locations reported over a foot 300mm of precipitation as well storm surge of 4 6feet 1 2m was expected along the eastern coastline along with dangerous waves on top of the surge though winds were reduced by the time georges hit cuba it still retained winds of 75mph 121kmh along with stronger gusts in squallsthe hurricanes heavy rainfall resulted in mudslides along the mountainous terrain this combined with strong winds damaged 60,475homes of which 3,481 were completely destroyed in the country 100,000 were left homeless due to hurricane georges high winds downed power lines trees and telephone poles leaving many in eastern cuba without electricity in the aftermath of the storm along the coast severe flooding washed out railroad and highway bridges though eastern cuba was the area most affected the central and western portion of the island including havana experienced torrential rains and strong wind gusts there strong waves broke over the seawall and caused heavy flood damage to some of the towns old buildingslike in puerto rico and hispaniola the severe drought during the el nio of 1997 exacerbated the floods disruption to crops in eastern cuba the heavy rainfall from georges damaged the crops greatly despite the effort to harvest them prior to its arrival up to 70% of the plantain crop a chief food in the countrys diet was destroyed the sugarcane crop fared badly as well limiting one of the countrys important export crops the coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane further damaging the countrys food supplywell-executed evacuations and warnings limited the death toll to six while damage amounted to 305million 1998usd 500million 2009usdthough georges was forecast to move through the bahamas it passed to the south of the archipelago it brought 70mph 110kmh winds to turks and caicos islands and south andros as well as precipitation in the storms outer bands though damage was minimal one person died in the countrythroughout the mainland areas of the united states georges left approximately 2.765billion in damage the hurricane ranked as the countrys fifth costliest hurricane at the time of its occurrence but has since fallen to the twentieth costliest due to extensive preparations only one direct death was attributed to the storm a tornado outbreak produced 47tornadoes20 in alabama 17 in florida and 10 in georgia leaving 36injuries and about 9million in damagein the florida keys georges brought a storm surge of up to 12ft 3.6m in tavernier the islands some only 7ft 2m high and 300yds 275m wide flooded easily tides reaching about 10ft 3m above normal inundated many parts of the overseas highway strong winds downed palm trees and power lines leaving all of the keys without power georgess waves overturned two boats in key west damaged 1,536houses and destroyed 173homes many of which were mobile homes rainfall amounted to a maximum of 8.41in 210mm in tavernier while other locations reported lesser amounts damage in the florida keys amounted to 200million strong winds knocked down power lines leaving 200,000without power in the miami areageorges produced a storm surge of up to 10ft 3m in the florida panhandle some roads were completely washed away in pensacola beach and navarre beach the storm surge and waves flattened about 1,125ft 343m of dunes between panama city beach and perdido key most of the beach access stairs and walkways suffered damage as the storm moved slowly through the northern gulf coast it produced torrential rainfall amounting to a maximum of 38.46in 976.88mm in munson causing extensive inland flooding several rivers and creeks in the western florida panhandle reached record or near-record levels including the blackwater river at baker the yellow river at milligan and the shoal river at crestview hundreds of homes along these rivers were flooded with at least 200homes damaged in santa rosa county and at least 639homes damaged and 7others destroyed in escambia county the storm left about 100million in damage in the florida panhandlethroughout the state the storm spawned 17tornadoes  the largest outbreak in the state since hurricane agnes in 1972 the strongest tornado rated f2 on the fujita scale touched-down in suwannee county near live oak destroying 1mobile home 7homes and 12cars while 5other structures suffered damage several residents were tossed out of their homes five people were injured and damage from the tornado reached over 1million overall damage in florida totaled at least 340millionupon making landfall in mississippi georges brought a storm surge peaking at 8.9ft 2.4m near pointe a la hache along with higher waves on top of it though the instrument failed shortly after the observation the storm surge caused extensive beach erosion with nearly 1,200ft 370m of sand was lost including 6ft 1.8m sand dunes leaving boardwalks formerly situated atop the dunes suspended near the waters surface the storm surge also inundated the chandeleur islands the first line of protection for the coasts of louisiana and mississippi the long island chain was reduced to a few banks of sand in the gulf of mexico grand gosier the home to a flock of brown pelicans experienced severe flooding destroying their habitats located on the weaker side of the storm rainfall totals in louisiana were low with a maximum amount of 2.98in 76mm in bogalusasustained winds in the state reached 48mph 77kmh and gusts peaked at 68mph 109kmh high winds downed power lines leaving 160,000without electricity across the state at least 50homes located outside the levee system were flooded by the storm surge while 85fishing camps on the banks of lake pontchartrain were destroyed overall impact from the hurricane was fairly minor with damages estimated at approximately 30.1million but no direct deaths due to well-executed evacuations however there were three indirect fatalities in the state two men collapsed and died due to medical conditions aggravated by the stress of the evacuation the other death occurred as the result of a house fire ignited by an emergency candle that was tipped overupon making landfall hurricane georges brought a storm surge of up to 8.9ft 2.7m in biloxi beach erosion occurred along the coastline resulting in some property damage on beach houses however around biloxi coastal casinos and the shipyards experienced little damage from the storm while stalling over the southern portion of the state it produced torrential rainfall amounting to 16.7in 420mm in pascagoula the heavy rainfall contributed to significant river overflowing including the tchoutacabouffa river at diberville which set a record crest of 19ft 5.7m the overflown rivers in the southern portion of the state flooded homes and forced more to evacuate just days after the hurricane came through along the coast of mississippi more than 1,000 homes were flooded one of the worst impacted areas inland was stone county where 54homes had minor damage 26suffered major damage and 5were destroyed in addition squall lines spawned multiple tornadoes damaging evacuation shelters in pascagoula and gautierone location observed hurricane-force winds with a sustained wind speed of 75mph 121kmh at keesler air force base in harrison county winds downed power lines signs and traffic light while damaging some roofs impact was similar but more severe in jackson county with more considerable damage to the roofs of some buildings while a few mobile homes were damaged or overturned throughout the state winds left approximately 230,000people without power after the storm over 6,800people stayed in 49different shelters one shelter in forrest county was damaged forcing the citizens to another camp overall hurricane georges caused about 676.8 million in damage though no deaths were reportedupon making landfall storm surge heights along the coast of alabama were estimated to have ranged from 7 to 12ft 2.1 to 3.7m with a peak of 11.9ft 3.6m in fort morgan along with 25ft 7.6m waves on top of it along the coastline heavy rainfall and strong waves caused extensive property damage in gulf shores 251houses 16apartment buildings and 70businesses experienced significant damage on dauphin island the hurricane damaged 80houses and left around 40uninhabitable many waterfront homes on the western side of the island were pushed into other homes or strewn into pieces across the sand some roads were completely washed away in orange beach two condominiums were heavily damaged one by fire and the other by high waves extensive storm surge flooding also occurred along mobile bay with storm surge of 8.0ft 2.4m at mobile bay causeway a number of businesses near the bridge were damagedsustained winds in alabama reached 54mph 87kmh at mobile aeroplex at brookley while gusts peaked at 64mph 103kmh at an agricultural station in fairhope high winds downed power lines and trees leaving 177,000people without power after the storm a total of 17shelters housed 4,977people in the aftermath of the storm wind damage to the buildings was minimal the storm spawned 20tornadoes throughout alabama the most devastating tornado touched-down in enterprise causing severe damage to camp wiregrass and a few homes while many residences in the city were left without electricity after numerous power lines were downed damages from the tornado amounted to roughly 1.5millionwhile moving slowly through the state it dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 29.66in 75mm in bay minette outer squalls spawned tornadoes in the southeast portion of the state though damage from them was minimal several rivers in southern alabama crested at record or near record heights at some locations including the conecuh river at brewton fish river perdido river and styx river many homes situated near the banks of these rivers were destroyed or suffered extensive damage flooding the shutdown many bridges highways and secondary roads in baldwin and escambia counties including interstate 10 near the alabamaflorida state line us route 29 and alabama state route 113 in flomaton and us 31 in brewton and flomaton overall damage in alabama amounted to 125million freshwater flooding in mobile resulted in one death the only direct death in the united statesin georgia the remnants of georges dropped 4in 100mm of rain across franklin county in appling county however rainfall of 57in 130180mm closed several roads and left 10,000 in damage atkinson county also reported flood damage of 15,000 in damage stewart county received over 5 inches 130mm of rain which caused extensive flooding that left several roads impassable damage from the storm totaled to 33,000 in the town of lumpkin a funnel cloud was reported but there were no damage in addition to the flooding the remnants of georges spawned numerous tornadoes across the state of georgia in randolph county an f1 tornado uprooted several trees and injured one person damage from the tornado totaled 500,000due to the extensive damage the name georges was retired following this storm and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with gaston in the 2004 season
