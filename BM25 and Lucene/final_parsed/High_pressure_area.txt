highpressure area  wikipedia a high-pressure area high or anticyclone is a region where the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the planet is greater than its surrounding environmentwinds within high-pressure areas flow outward from the higher pressure areas near their centers towards the lower pressure areas further from their centers gravity adds to the forces causing this general movement because the higher pressure compresses the column of air near the center of the area into greater density  and so greater weight compared to lower pressure lower density and lower weight of the air outside the centerhowever because the planet is rotating underneath the atmosphere and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it the air flow from center to periphery is not direct but is twisted due to the coriolis effect or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference viewed from above this twist in wind direction is in the same direction as the rotation of the planetthe strongest high-pressure areas are associated with cold air masses which push away out of polar regions during the winter when there is less sun to warm neighboring regions these highs change character and weaken once they move further over relatively warmer water bodiessomewhat weaker but more common are high-pressure areas caused by atmospheric subsidence that is areas where large masses of cooler drier air descend from an elevation of 8 to 15km after the lower temperatures have precipitated out the water vapormany of the features of highs may be understood in context of middle- or meso-scale and relatively enduring dynamics of a planets atmospheric circulation for example massive atmospheric subsidences occur as part of the descending branches of ferrel cells and hadley cells hadley cells help form the subtropical ridge steer tropical waves and tropical cyclones across the ocean and is strongest during the summer the subtropical ridge also helps form most of the worlds desertson english-language weather maps high-pressure centers are identified by the letter h weather maps in other languages may use different letters or symbolsthe direction of wind flow around an atmospheric high-pressure area and a low-pressure area as seen from above depends on the hemisphere high-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere low-pressure systems rotate clockwise in the southern hemispherethe scientific terms in english used to describe the weather systems generated by highs and lows were introduced in the mid-1800s mostly by the british the scientific theories which explain the general phenomena originated about two centuries earlierthe term cyclone was coined by henry piddington of the british east india company to describe the devastating storm of december 1789 in coringa india a cyclone forms around a low-pressure area anticyclone the term for the kind of weather around a high-pressure area was coined in 1877 by francis galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved in the opposite direction of a cyclone in british english the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise making the label anticyclones a logical extensiona simple rule of thumb is that for high-pressure areas where generally air flows from the center outward the coriolis force given by the earths rotation to the air circulation is in the opposite direction of earths apparent rotation if viewed from above the hemispheres pole so both the earth and winds around a low-pressure area rotate counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern the opposite to these two cases occurs in the case of a high these results derive from the coriolis effect that article explains in detail the physics and provides an animation of a model to aid understandinghigh-pressure systems form due to downward motion through the troposphere the atmospheric layer where weather occurs preferred areas within a synoptic flow pattern in higher levels of the troposphere are beneath the western side of troughson weather maps these areas show converging winds isotachs also known as convergence near or above the level of non-divergence which is near the 500 hpa pressure surface about midway up through the troposphere and about half the atmospheric pressure at the surfacehigh-pressure systems are alternatively referred to as anticyclones on english-language weather maps high-pressure centers are identified by the letter h in english within the isobar with the highest pressure value on constant pressure upper level charts it is located within the highest height line contourhighs are frequently associated with light winds at the surface and subsidence through the lower portion of the troposphere in general subsidence will dry out an air mass by adiabatic or compressional heating thus high pressure typically brings clear skies during the day since no clouds are present to reflect sunlight there is more incoming shortwave solar radiation and temperatures rise at night the absence of clouds means that outgoing longwave radiation ie heat energy from the surface is not absorbed giving cooler diurnal low temperatures in all seasons when surface winds become light the subsidence produced directly under a high-pressure system can lead to a buildup of particulates in urban areas under the ridge leading to widespread haze if the low level relative humidity rises towards 100 percent overnight fog can formstrong vertically shallow high-pressure systems moving from higher latitudes to lower latitudes in the northern hemisphere are associated with continental arctic air masses once arctic air moves over an unfrozen ocean the air mass modifies greatly over the warmer water and takes on the character of a maritime air mass which reduces the strength of the high-pressure system when extremely cold air moves over relatively warm oceans polar lows can develop however warm and moist or maritime tropical air masses that move poleward from tropical sources are slower to modify than arctic air massesin terms of climatology high pressure forms at the horse latitudes or torrid zone between the latitudes of 20 and 40 degrees from the equator as a result of air that has been uplifted at the equator as the hot air rises it cools losing moisture it is then transported poleward where it descends creating the high-pressure area this is part of the hadley cell circulation and is known as the subtropical ridge or subtropical high and is strongest in the summer the subtropical ridge is a warm core high-pressure system meaning it strengthens with height many of the worlds deserts are caused by these climatological high-pressure systemssome climatological high-pressure areas acquire regionally based names the land-based siberian high often remains quasi-stationary for more than a month during the most frigid time of the year making it unique in that regard it is also a bit larger and more persistent than its counterpart in north america surface winds accelerating down valleys down the western pacific ocean coastline causing the winter monsoon arctic high-pressure systems such as the siberian high are cold core meaning that they weaken with height the influence of the azores high also known as the bermuda high brings fair weather over much of the north atlantic ocean and mid to late summer heat waves in western europe along its southerly periphery the clockwise circulation often impels easterly waves and tropical cyclones that develop from them across the ocean towards landmasses in the western portion of ocean basins during the hurricane season the highest barometric pressure ever recorded on earth was 1,085.7 hectopascals 32.06inhg measured in tonsontsengel mongolia on 19 december 2001wind flows from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure this is due to density differences between the two air masses since stronger high-pressure systems contain cooler or drier air the air mass is more dense and flows towards areas that are warm or moist which are in the vicinity of low pressure areas in advance of their associated cold fronts the stronger the pressure difference or pressure gradient between a high-pressure system and a low-pressure system the stronger the wind the coriolis force caused by the earths rotation is what gives winds within high-pressure systems their clockwise circulation in the northern hemisphere as the wind moves outward and is deflected right from the center of high pressure and counterclockwise circulation in the southern hemisphere as the wind moves outward and is deflected left from the center of high pressure friction with land slows down the wind flowing out of high-pressure systems and causes wind to flow more outward than would be the case in the absence of friction this is known as a geostrophic wind
