baltimore-washington metropolitan area united states hurricane isabel formed from a tropical wave on september 6 2003 in the tropical atlantic ocean it moved northwestward and within an environment of light wind shear and warm waters it steadily strengthened to reach peak winds of 165mph 265kmh on september 11 after fluctuating in intensity for four days isabel gradually weakened and made landfall on the outer banks of north carolina with winds of 105mph 165kmh on september 18 it quickly weakened over land and became extratropical over western pennsylvania the next dayon september 19 tropical storm isabel passed through extreme western maryland though its large circulation produced tropical storm force winds throughout the state about 1.24million people lost power throughout the state the worst of its effects came from its storm surge which inundated areas along the coast and resulted in severe beach erosion on the eastern shore hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed primarily in queen annes county from tidal flooding thousands of houses were affected in central maryland with severe storm surge flooding reported in baltimore and annapolis washington dc sustained moderate damage primarily from the winds throughout maryland and washington damage totaled about 945million 2003usd 1.23billion 2017usd with only one fatality due to floodingwhile isabel was still over the western atlantic ocean as a category 5 hurricane forecasters predicted the storm would move northwestward and within five days be at a position 130miles 210km east-southeast of ocean city maryland as a 115mph 185kmh major hurricane by four days before isabel made landfall most computer models predicted isabel to make landfall between north carolina and new jersey on september 16 about two days before the hurricane struck land the national hurricane center issued a hurricane watch for the southern region of the maryland coastline on the chesapeake bay later that day a tropical storm watch was issued for the eastern maryland coastline which was upgraded to a tropical storm warning by about 24hours before landfallofficials recommended the citizens on smith island to evacuate on the day prior to the hurricane making landfall the only evacuations for the eastern shore of maryland mandatory evacuations were ordered for low-lying and other specific areas in calvert st marys and charles counties and the residents in six homes were asked to leave in howard county officials recommended residents in flood areas of baltimore county to evacuate and some in the city of baltimore left spontaneously due to flooding evacuation rates were low throughout the maryland coastline with the highest rate being in the southernmost counties on the western shore the primary reason for people staying was due to the track of the hurricane between 20% and 33% of those who participated in an evacuation survey said they had concerns about being caught on roadways while trying to evacuate as the storm arrived with similar numbers expressing concern about being able to return to their homes if they evacuated of those who left most went to the house of a friend or family member with two-thirds to three-fourths going to destinations in their own neighborhood or county most did not evacuate until the day before or the day of landfall in most areas the public response to the evacuation orders was normal to fast with traffic during the evacuation described as light to normal the most significant problems experienced during the evacuation were downed trees inadequate

5feet 1.5m of beach and throughout the chesapeake bay the erosion deposited about 81,000tons 73,500t of sediment into the bay the erosion was irregular however some locations were unaffected while others experienced greater losses despite that the two locations were similar the erosion and storm surge damaged many bulkheads and after the storm surge retreated into the bay it washed away
