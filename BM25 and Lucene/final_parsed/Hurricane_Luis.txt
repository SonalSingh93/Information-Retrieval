hurricane luis  wikipedia hurricane luis was a long-lived and an extremely destructive cape verde-type hurricane as well as one of the strongest deadliest and most notable hurricanes of the 1995 atlantic hurricane season with maximum sustained winds of 140mph 220kmh luis was also the strongest hurricane to make landfall and the third-most intense hurricane recorded during the extremely active season the storm was the twelfth tropical storm sixth hurricane and second major hurricane of the season at one point the storm was one of four simultaneous tropical systems in the atlantic basin along with humberto iris and karen the storm lasted for 14days as a tropical storm between late august and nearly middle septemberthe system initially formed from a tropical wave south of cape verde islands west of africa on august 27 then subsequently attained tropical storm status on august 29 two days later that day the storm reached hurricane status shortly thereafter it rapidly strengthened into a 140mph 220kmh category 4 hurricane at this strength it affected much of the leeward islands on september 4 to september 6 throughout the following days luis gradually weakened as it accelerated safely to the west of bermuda as a category 1 hurricane luis made landfall on newfoundland before it became extratropical on september 11it caused catastrophic damage in antigua barbuda st barthelemy st martin and anguilla as a category 4 with winds of 130mph 209kmh the storm accounted for 19 deaths left between 20,000 and 70,000 homeless mostly in antigua barbuda and saint martin and caused roughly 3 billion 1995usd in damage across the affected areas hurricane luis was the most devastating hurricane to strike the northern leeward islands in the 20th century and one of the strongest storms to hit the leeward islands at the time along with hurricane david in 1979 and hurricane hugo in 1989 additionally luis was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect guadeloupe in a short period of time the first being hurricane iris a week before and the last being hurricane marilyn only ten days afterward the next year the leeward islands would be struck by hurricane bertha while still repairing from luis and marilyn then successively hit by hortense erika georges jose lenny and debbyluis was also responsible for an intense rogue wave which struck rmsqueen elizabeth 2 on monday september 11 though the ship pulled through with little damagethe origins of hurricane luis trace back to an area of disturbed weather associated with a tropical wave over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 26 a low-level circulation center formed and moved westward until it developed a weak surface low on august 27 consequently a tropical depression was designated at 1200 utc that day the depression attained 36 hours later into a tropical storm named luis on august 29 though convective activity fluctuated for the next two days as a result of nearby wind shear the storm slowly intensified while pressure rose the shear relented the next day allowing an eye to gradually form and the system attained hurricane status thereafter on early august 31 then a category 3 major hurricane 18 hours laterhurricane luis continued to strengthen as it tracked west-northwestward into a category 4 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale on september 2 and the cyclone turned more towards the west earlier that day as it maintained a rectilinear slow motion on september 3 a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed that the storm that reached category 4 status earlier peaked with 140mph 230kmh and maintained it for two days and a half at this time it was located approximately 540 miles 870km to the east of the lesser antilles as a result the storm began to slightly accelerate as it moved along a subtropical ridge due to the absorption of karen by the stronger irisby the day of september 4 luis sustained a large wind field as it approach the lesser antilles its tropical storm-force winds measured from 345mi 555km to 365mi 587km in diameter as it begin to affected in the night antigua barbuda dominica and guadeloupe on the morning of september 5 islands such as dominica and even the islands of guadeloupe where it experienced hurricane-force winds on the northeastern coast of grande-terre and dsirade has been relatively spared by the storm however the eyewall of the hurricane skimed antigua and directly passing over barbuda while weakened slightly during the time it proceeded slowly northwestward affecting montserrat saint kitts and nevis sint eustatius and saba causing moderate damage later luis moved along st barthelemy st martin and ultimately crossed anguilla where maximum sustained winds within the eyewall were estimated to have reached 135mph 217kmh and its central pressure had dropped from 945 to 942mbar 27.9 to 27.8inhga large and powerful hurricane luis retained category 4 intensity until september 7 situated about 150mi 240km to the north of puerto rico the storm gradually re-curved over the northern atlantic as a category 2 after having spent 7 consecutive days as a major hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 115mph 185kmh from september 1 to 8 from there on the center of the storm passed 200 miles 320km to the west of bermuda on september 9 causing minor damage and then later weakened to a category2 hurricane with winds of 110mph 165kmh several hours later the hurricane made its closest approach to bermuda passing about 200mi 320km west of the island later that day the storm began to accelerate as it traveled northeast ahead of a strong trough located to the northwest of luis during the afternoon of september10 hurricane luis began to undergo an extratropical transition as it rapidly approached the canadian coastline due to the rapid movement of the storm significant weakening did not occur until luis was at an unusually high latitude as the central pressure of the storm decreased to 961mbar 28.38inhg but sustained winds did not exceed 90mph 140kmh according to the nhcluis maintained this intensity until it made landfall on the avalon peninsula in eastern newfoundland early on september11 while tracking over newfoundland cold dry air became entrenched in luiss circulation and the system began to merge with the approaching trough the nhc issued their final advisory on hurricane luis at 0900utc on september11 as it tracked nearly 65mph 100kmh to the northeast and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on september 11 as it moved ashore on eastern newfoundland the extratropical remnants persisted for 30more hours over the north atlantic ocean before being absorbed by the trough near the southern coast of greenland late on september12.3 days before devastation occurred in the northern lesser antilles hurricane luis became a category 4 hurricane and forecasted to avoid those area well to the north following humberto and karen however as karen neared iris it weakened and absorbed by a stronger iris as influenced by the subtropical ridge steering luis to the westdue to its slow motion giving local officials ample time to prepare in advance of the storm tropical cyclone watches and warnings were declared in several areas throughout the caribbean seventeen watches andor warnings were issued in association with luis the first two were a hurricane watch issued on antigua barbuda and guadeloupe on september2 at 2200utc five hours later a tropical storm watch was issued for dominica at 2100utc a hurricane warning was issued for antigua barbuda and a hurricane watch for guadeloupe at 1500utc puerto rico was put under a tropical storm watch at 1700utc guadeloupe st barthelemy and french portion of st martin were put under a hurricane warning four hours later puerto rico us and british virgin islands were put under a tropical storm warning this is including martinique and saint luciaadditionally a tropical storm warning was also issued for bermuda on september 7 all of which were canceled by september 10 however there were no tropical storm watches or warnings issued for any part of atlantic canadaoverall luis caused extensive crop and property damage across the leeward islands due to its high associated powerful winds and heavy rainfall the exact amount of damage caused by the storm is unknown due to lack of reports from affected areas since iris though it is estimated at 3billion 1995usdas a result of a direct hit from the category4 hurricane both antigua and barbuda experienced extensive damage to residences from 135mph winds and over 10 inches 250mm of rain according to the islands prime minister a great number of houses were damaged or destroyed in barbuda and nearly 45% of the residences on antigua were eradicated by the hurricane as it passed 25 miles 40km to the north of the island across the islands numerous inhabitants experienced power outages and disrupted water systems the storm ultimately accounted for three deaths and injured 165 locals 32.000 inhabitants on both islands were greatly affected forced 1,700 people to take shelter and left approximately 3,200 others homeless throughout the country the total damage from the storm was estimated 350million or 60% of the countrys gdp worth of damage was assessedinternational aid was sought after the storm had made its passing with shelter and food supplies being the most neededluis caused some damage as it passed 60 miles 97km north of guadeloupe essentially of grande-terre hurricane-force condition resulted in of moderate damage to homes and roofs uprooted trees and severe beach erosion meanwhile the basse-terre region received minor damage except to banana crops that been damaged at nearly 90% and sugar cane crops on the north at nearly 20%

soufrire within the 48-hour period that damaged some roads specifically in the west coast where high waves washed houses and coastal road the meteorological office in raizet recorded sustained winds of 48 miles per hour 77kmh with gusts reached 66 miles per hour 106kmh reported a fall in minimal pressure to 994 mb 29.36 in hg around 3 to 4 am on september5 and a total 178 millimetres 7.0in of rain during the whole period only the easternmost island desirade recorded a hurricane force-wind at 75 miles per hour 121kmh and a sustained gust at 84 miles per hour 135kmh between 3 and 4 on september 5 and a 990 mb 29.23 in hg pressure the storm claimed the life of a 29-year-old french tourist who had been dragged away by vigorous waves on a pier in eastern saint-franois the total damage estimated at 250 millions of francs 50 millions usd especially for the crops and the roadsthe islands suffered extensive damages from 135mph 215kmh winds as the hurricane passed 155miles 25km north of saint barthelemy the main weather station recorded wind speeds of 125mph 200kmh and gusts of up to 155mph 250kmh this difference may be due to local effects produced by mountainous terrain on the island and the aircraft sampling winds at a level above the region of maximum winds additionally minimal recorded pressure was at 948mbar 28.0inhg as the storm made its closest approach and stay below 1,000mbar 30inhg for at least 36hours periodthe island received the hardest condition of the eyewall as luis passed 15 miles 24km to 20 miles 32km northeast of st martin causing very extensive damage at 70% and spawning several f3 tornadoes a total of 6.50in 165mm of rain has been recorded on the islands territory during the 48 hours periodin grand case bay 90% of the houses were damaged or destroyed as a result of rough sea conditions and very strong winds damage was also common in other towns such as marigot french quarter and philipsburg where at least 70% of the city was decimated by the storm it also caused the great salt pond to deluge several streets leaving them partially submerged by 1 feet of the 1,500 boats sheltered in simpson bay lagoon nearly 1,300 or 85% were sunken or

island spent nearly 3 months without water and power luis killed nine people two in the french side and seven drowned in the dutch sideprincess juliana airport recorded 87mph 140kmh sustained winds with maximum gusts of 114mph 183kmh the barometric pressure at its lowest fell between 963 to 964mbar 28.4 to 28.5inhg the met office on the french side grand case airport of the island also measured a wind gust of 202mph 325kmh while an unofficial anenometer in marigots marina recorded wind gusts around 126mph 203kmh tropical storm-force winds brushed the islands for approximately 21 hours while hurricane-force sustained winds lasted up to 8 hours as the hurricane passed with minimal forward speed between 7mph 11kmh to 9mph 14kmh total damages in both sides french and dutch was astronomic accounted for 1.8billion 1995usd worth of damage as such luis was the most devastating hurricane to hit the islands since hurricane donna in 1960the eye of the hurricane past on the northeastern tip of anguilla although the island would have sustained worst damage than of st martin total damage was still unknown luis was the worst hurricane the island suffered from 1960's hurricane donnaluis passed nearly 50 miles 80km northeast that caused very severe beach erosion moderate damage to residences and leaving at least 2,000 homeless on saint kitts and nevis the vegetation and some of the road infrastructure was badly damaged as a result of the storm with problems essentially arising in relation to the poor water system total damage ultimately reached to 197millionas luis passed nearly at 120 miles 190km north majority of the damage experienced in dominica was inflicted to banana crops that had already been damaged from iris at 70% while overall damages was fairly minor beach erosion was common and that disrupt and washed few beach hotels and coastal roads where about 1,000 people were left homeless due to rough waves on the northeastern and the western coast of the islands town such as marigot roseau and portsmouth 40 miles 64km tropical storm force-wind affected most part of the islands from the earliest on september 5 until the afternoon of september 5 and lowest pressure recorded was between 1,000 to 1,005mbar 29.5 to 29.7inhg ultimately a fisherman was confirmed killed due to rough sea conditions all in all property damage was estimated at 47million the storm contributed to the effects of hurricane iris which had struck the country a week before and hurricane marilyn 10 days after total at 184millionluis passed at 120 miles 190km northeast of puerto rico causing minor damages in the east there were two deaths reported in the islandsbermuda reported sustained winds of 46 miles per hour 74kmh however little to no damage has been reported offshore the storm produced waves approaching 100 feet 30m in heightrough seas from the storm affected the us east coast resulting in some beach erosion and damage to two waterfront structures on fire island on september7 rip currents produced by luis caused the death of one person near corncake inlet north carolina high waves in combination with high tide caused significant beach erosion and coastal flooding in brunswick county eight homes were washed away by the waves and 40 feet 12m of beach was lost in hyde carteret and onslow counties waves up to 17 feet 5.2m washed out 33 feet 10m of the triple s pier in atlantic beach was destroyed total losses in north carolina amounted to 1.9million in new york rough seas undermined one home destroyed it and led to the death of one person who was swimming in the high waveson september 11 a rogue wave triggered by luis slammed queen elizabeth 2 when it was about 200 nautical miles 370km 230mi south of eastern newfoundland at about the same time a nearby canadian buoy recorded a 98-foot wave 30m though the ship did not sustain any significant damage its arrival in new york was delayed considerablythroughout eastern newfoundland the system dropped 2.4 to 4.7 inches 61 to 119mm of rain at its landfall as a category 1 northwesterly winds there gusted to 81mph 130kmh the storm caused minor damage to the large province one storm-related death was reported in canada flooding from luis caused an estimated 500,000 in damagesby september29 the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs provided both antigua and

of spain contributed 15,873 in emergency funds to the affected regionsaside from high winds and seas possible explanation for the storms heavy damage may have been complacency on the part of local island populations and their houses another factual reason was substantial difference in wind speed forecasts measured at sea-level princess juliana airport on the dutch side and those measured on homes throughout the island hillsides  broadcast from sites off the island sea-level airport readings showed 86mph 139kmh sustained winds and winds gusting to 114mph 183kmh whereas measurements on some hillside homes and especially the airport on the north of the french side between two mountains showed wind gusts between 170 and 205mph 275 and 330kmh an sailor that been sheltered in the lagoon recorded a 115mph 185kmh winds gusting and a minimal pressure reading to 965mbar 28.5inhgwhen tropical depression thirteen strengthened into tropical storm luis on august29 it marked the earliest date on which the twelfth named storm of any season formed surpassing the previous record set by tropical storm twelve of the 1933 seasonshortly before becoming extratropical hurricane luis was moving at 65mph 105kmh becoming one of the fastest moving atlantic hurricanes in recorded historyon september11 a 98 feet 30m wave struck an ocean liner this wave is the largest wave ever recorded however hurricane ivan in 2004 may have produced a wave up to 130 feet 40m high off the coast of mexicosince 1950 there have been very few atlantic hurricanes that have had an accumulated cyclone energy ace index over 50 as it spent nearly fourteen days as a named storm luis achieved and ace value of 53.5 which was the highest since inez in 1966 and remained the highest until being surpassed by hurricanes isabel in 2003 ivan in 2004 and irma in 2017due to the severe damage and loss of life caused by the storm in the leeward islands the name luis was retired in the spring of 1996 and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with lorenzo in the 2001 season luis was the first atlantic hurricane name beginning with l and the first hurricane to be retired in three years since hurricane andrew in 1992
