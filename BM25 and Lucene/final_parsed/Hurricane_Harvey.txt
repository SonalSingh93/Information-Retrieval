hurricane harvey  wikipedia hurricane harvey was the costliest tropical cyclone on record inflicting nearly 200billion in damage breaking the previous record set by hurricane katrina primarily from widespread flooding in the houston metropolitan area it was the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 ending a record 12-year span in which no hurricanes made landfall at such an intensity in the country in a four-day period many areas received more than 40 inches 100cm of rain as the system slowly meandered over eastern texas and adjacent waters causing catastrophic flooding with peak accumulations of 64.58in 164.0cm harvey was the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the united states the resulting floods inundated hundreds of thousands of homes displaced more than 30,000people and prompted more than 17,000rescuesthe eighth named storm third hurricane and the first major hurricane of the extremely active 2017 atlantic hurricane season harvey developed from a tropical wave to the east of the lesser antilles reaching tropical storm status on august17 the storm crossed through the windward islands on the following day passing just south of barbados and later near saint vincent upon entering the caribbean sea harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of colombia early on august20 the remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west-northwestward across the caribbean and the yucatn peninsula before redeveloping over the bay of campeche on august23 harvey then began to rapidly intensify on august24 regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day while the storm moved generally northwest harveys intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from august2425 however harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained category4 intensity later that day hours later harvey made landfall near rockport texas at peak intensity afterwards rapid weakening ensued and harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the lone star state on august28 it emerged back over the gulf of mexico strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in louisiana on august29 as harvey drifted inland it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on september1 before dissipating two days laterharvey caused at least 91 confirmed deaths 1 in guyana and 90 in the united states total damage from the hurricane is estimated at 198.63billion making it the costliest natural disaster ever in the united statesearly on august13 the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave on the western coast of africa amid favorable environmental conditions the wave was expected to merge with a broad area of low pressure to its east southwest of cape verde and gradually organize thereafter instead the two disturbances remained separate with the broad trough continuing westward and the tropical wave moving farther north eventually becoming potential tropical cyclone ten on august17 shower and thunderstorm activity in association with the trough began to show signs of organization while high-resolution satellite showed an increasingly defined low-level circulation as such the nhc initiated advisories on a potential tropical cyclone allowing tropical storm watches and warnings to be hoisted for portions of the lesser antilles an air force reserve hurricane hunter aircraft deployed to the disturbance later that afternoon found a well-defined center and tropical storm-force winds prompting the nhc to upgrade it to tropical storm harvey at 21:00utcfollowing its designation the cyclone moved swiftly westward into the caribbean sea under the influence of an expansive ridge of high pressure to its north an environment of moderate wind shear complicated the weather of the storms intensity with global forecast models suggesting dissipation in the central caribbean whereas statistical and hurricane models suggested the potential for harvey to be near hurricane strength in later days over the next day the storm changed little in structure remaining poorly organized with its low-level center on the eastern edge of associated deep convection harveys presentation began to deteriorate early on august19 its convective pattern became elongated while the circulation became less defined in fact a reconnaissance aircraft was unable to find a loosely-closed circulation at 850mb 4,781ft though it did locate one at lower levels harvey was downgraded to a tropical depression at 21:00utc on august19 six hours later based on continued data from a reconnaissance aircraft it was declared an open tropical waveearly on august20 the nhc began monitoring the remnants of harvey for redevelopment although the effects of strong upper-level winds and dry air were expected to limit development in the near-term conditions were expected to become more conducive to tropical storm and hurricane conditions when the disturbance entered the northwestern caribbean sea and especially in the bay of campeche despite an increase in convective organization the disturbance still lacked a well-defined center as it approached the yucatn peninsula while traversing inland satellite images and surface observations indicated that the circulation became better defineda reconnaissance aircraft investigating the remnants of harvey around 15:00utc on august23 indicated that it once again acquired a well-defined center and the nhc upgraded it to a tropical depression accordingly the system began to slowly consolidate amid an increasingly favorable environment attaining tropical storm intensity by 06:00utc on august24 later that morning harvey began to undergo rapid intensification as an eye developed and its central pressure quickly fell by 17:00utc the storm was upgraded to the third hurricane of the season slight entrainment of dry air slowed the intensification process however by the next day harvey was able to quickly strengthen into a category3 major hurricane by 19:00utc further deepening occurred as the storm approached the coast of texas with harvey becoming a category4 hurricane at 23:00utc based on reconnaissance aircraft data around 03:00utc on august26 the hurricane made landfall at peak intensity at rockport with winds of 135mph 215kmh and an atmospheric pressure of 938mbar 27.7inhg harvey became the first major hurricane to make landfall in the united states since wilma in 2005 and the strongest in terms of wind speed to hit the country since charley in 2004 it was the first hurricane to strike texas since hurricane ike in 2008 the first major hurricane in the state since bret in 1999 and the strongest in texas since carla in 1961after striking land the storm moved over the copano bay and made a second landfall in texas just north of holiday beach at 06:00utc on august26 as a category3 hurricane afterwards rapid weakening ensued as its speed slowed dramatically to a crawl and harvey weakened to a tropical storm at 18:00utc on august26 for about two days the storm stalled just inland dropping very heavy rainfall and causing widespread flash flooding harveys center drifted back towards the southeast positioning itself near or just off the texas coast at matagorda by 15:00 utc on august 28 once offshore convection blossomed and allowed the once-exposed low-level circulation to become obscured an air force reconnaissance plane investigating the system during the afternoon of august29 found that maximum winds had increased to 50mph 85kmh around 09:00utc the next morning harvey made its third and final landfall just west of cameron louisiana with winds of 45mph 75kmhthe system continued north and then north-northeast weakening to a tropical depression over central louisiana around 00:00utc on august30 associated convection with harvey became focused north of the center and along a warm front on september1 indicating that the system transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone by 15:00utc that day however harveys remnants continued moving northeastward while slowly weakening late on september 2 the wpc issued its final advisory on harveys remnant low while it was located over ohio harveys remnants continued to drift northward before being absorbed by another low pressure system north of lake erie late on september 3tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the windward islands were issued starting at 15:00utc on august17 about six hours before harvey developed at that time a tropical storm watch was posted for dominica while a tropical storm warning became in effect in barbados martinique saint lucia and saint vincent and the grenadines all watches and warnings were discontinued by late on august18 as the storm continued westward into the caribbeanin

relief mexico later rescinded their commitment for aid after hurricane katia made landfall on mexicos gulf coast on september 9 2017 venezuela offered 5 million through the state-owned citgo petroleum which operates a refinery in corpus christithe floodwaters contain a number of hazards to the environment and human health the houston health department stated that millions of contaminants were present in floodwaters these include e coli and coliform bacteria measurements of colony-forming units showed the concentrations were so high that there were risks of contracting flesh-eating disease from the waterhouston officials stated that the houston drinking water and sewer systems were intact however hundreds of thousands of people across the 38 texas counties affected by hurricane harvey use private wells according to an estimate by louisiana state university researchers and those people must fend for themselves additionally harris county which includes houston contains a large number of superfund-designed brownfield sites that contain a wide variety of toxins and carcinogens two superfund sites in corpus christi were floodedthe geography of houston places it in a low-lying part of the gulf coastal plain and its clay-based soils provide poor drainage the climate of houston brings very heavy rainfall which together with tidal flood events means that there have been repeated floods in the city ever since its founding in 1836 though the flood control district founded in 1947 aided by the us army corps of engineers managed to prevent statewide flooding for over fifty years more recently residents died in historic flooding in may 2015 and in the april 2016 tax day floods there is a tendency for storms to move very slowly over the region and drop huge amounts of rain over an extended period as occurred during tropical storm claudette in 1979 and tropical storm allison in 2001the area is a very flat flood plain at shallow gradient slowly draining rainwater through an intricate network of channels and bayous to the sea the main waterways the san jacinto river and the buffalo bayou meander slowly laden with mud and have little capacity for carrying storm waterhouston has seen rapid urban development urban sprawl with absorbent prairie and wetlands replaced by hard surfaces which rapidly shed storm water overwhelming the drainage capacity of the rivers and channels between 1992 and 2010 almost 25,000 acres of wetlands were lost decreasing the detention capacity of the region by four billion gallons however harvey was estimated to have dropped more than fifteen trillion gallons of water in the areathe katy prairie in western harris county which once helped to absorb floodwaters in the region has been reduced to one quarter of its previous size in the last several decades due to suburban development and one analysis discovered that more than 7,000 housing units have been built within the 100-year floodplain in harris county since 2010extraction of oil and groundwater from underground aquifers leaves unsupported voids resulting in ground collapse a process called subsidence houston itself is in a very large subsidence bowl with smaller bowls within that area showing greater subsidence in some cases as much as 9 feet 2.7m these result in drainage systems no longer having the required gradient to operate efficiently so storm water drains more slowly the coastline near houston has seen sea level increasing by 6 inches 15cm in recent decades due to subsidence combined with the effects of climate changethe gulf of mexico is known for hurricanes in august so their incidence alone cannot be attributed to global warming but the warming climate does influence certain attributes of storms studies in this regard show that storms tend to intensify more rapidly prior to landfall weather events are due to multiple factors and so cannot be said to be caused by one precondition but climate change affects aspects of extreme events and very likely worsened some of the impacts of harvey in a briefing the world meteorological organization stated that the quantity of rainfall from harvey had very likely been increased by climate change the relationship between climate change and the frequency of hurricanes or tropical cyclones is still unclear and is the subject of continuing researchharvey approached houston over sea-surface waters which were significantly above average temperatures warm waters provide the main source of energy for hurricanes and increased ocean heat can result in storms being larger more intense and longer lasting in particular bringing greatly increased rainfall sea level rise added to the resulting problems according to officials from the harris county flood control district harvey caused the third 500-year flood in three years  the national climate assessment statesthe recent increases in activity are linked in part to higher sea surface temperatures in the region that atlantic hurricanes form in and move through numerous factors have been shown to influence these local sea surface temperatures including natural variability human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases and particulate pollution quantifying the relative contributions of natural and human-caused factors is an active focus of researchwarmer air can hold more water vapour in accordance with the clausiusclapeyron relation and there has been a global increase of daily rainfall records regional sea surface temperatures around houston have risen around 0.5c 0.9f in recent decades which caused a 35% increase in moisture in the atmosphere this had the effect of allowing harvey to strengthen more than expected the water temperature of the gulf of mexico was above average for this time of the year and likely to be a factor in harveys impact within a week of harvey hurricane irma formed due to the same unusually warm sea-water some scientists fear this may be becoming a new normal also higher sea-water temperatures can make hurricanes more devastatingthe slow movement of harvey over texas allowed the storm to drop prolonged heavy rains on the state as has also happened with earlier storms harveys stalled position was due to weak prevailing winds linked to a greatly expanded subtropical high pressure system over much of the us at the time which had pushed the jet stream to the north research and model simulations have indicated an association between this pattern and human-caused climate changeother tropical cyclones that made landfall in the same region of the texas gulf coasthurricane ike 2008 the last hurricane to make landfall in texas before harvey
