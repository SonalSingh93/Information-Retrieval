hurricane opal  wikipedia hurricane opal was the most intense category4 hurricane that did not reach category5 intensity a powerful and intense hurricane that caused severe damage along the northern gulf coast of the united states in october 1995 opal was the ninth hurricane and the strongest of the abnormally active 1995 atlantic hurricane season it crossed the yucatn peninsula while still a tropical depression on september 27 then strengthened and moved northward in the gulf becoming the most powerful category 4 atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall october 4 in the florida panhandle near pensacola as a 115-mph 185-kmh hurricane opal devastated the pensacolapanhandle area with a 15-ft 5-m storm surge and traveled up the entire state of alabama becoming a tropical storm in tennessee opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-atlantic states before dissipatingthroughout the storms path from central america into the ohio valley 63 people died in storm-related events losses attributed to opal exceeded 5.1billion much of which took place in the united states the name opal was retired in 1996 replaced by olga for the 2001 seasonthe origins of hurricane opal were linked using satellite imagery and synoptic analyses to a tropical wave that left the western coast of africa on september11 ten days later the disturbance had crossed the central atlantic and had reached the lesser antilles continuing to track westward the disturbance showed little signs of organization before entering the western caribbean sea on september23 there the wave became entangled with a broad area of low-pressure east of nicaragua and the combined system drifted west-northwestward toward the yucatn peninsula even then the disturbance lacked any significant development however a burst of thunderstorm activity occurred near the storms center on september27 prompting the national hurricane centernhc to declare the system a tropical depression at 18:00utc that day at the time the depression was centered 80mi 130km south-southeast of cozumel mexicothe primordial depression meandered across the yucatn peninsula during the three days following tropical cyclogenesis due to the lack of dominant steering currents despite remaining over land for an extended period the depression developed organized rainbands and ships in the region reported weather conditions that were suggestive of a stronger system as a result the nhc upgraded the disturbance to tropical storm intensity at 12:00utc on september30 while the storm was over the north-central coast of yucatn this classification resulted in the tropical cyclone being named opal which also made it the first atlantic storm to be given a name starting with the letter o over the next two days opal would enter the gulf of mexico and track slowly west-southwestward into the bay of campeche there the storm strengthened into a hurricane at 12:00utc on october2 shortly afterward a primitive eye began to form at the same time a strong trough tracking across the united states caused opal to slowly turn northeastwardafter clearing the bay of campeche opal accelerated towards the united states gulf coast the combination of warm sea surface temperatures associated with an unusually warm pocket of warm ocean waters and an upper-level high pressure area over the gulf of mexico resulted in a highly conductive environment for intensification after a significant reorganization in opals internal structure the hurricane was able to rapidly intensify in these favorable conditions at 12:00utc on october4 opal reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150mph 240kmh and a minimum barometric pressure of 916 hpa 27.05inhg making it a category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale the tropical cyclones eye measured 12mi 19km at peak intensity as the storm was beginning an eyewall replacement cycle the progression of this cycle resulted in opals gradual weakening thereafter at 22:00utc that day opal made landfall between pensacola beach florida and cape san blas as a category3 hurricane with winds of 115mph 185kmh weakening quickened as opal moved further inland degenerating into a tropical depression over tennessee less than a day after landfall the diffusing cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone shortly afterwards these extratropical remnants tracked towards the northeast before they were last noted along the northern coast of lake ontario in quebecalthough opal was a weak system located over the yucatn peninsula at the time 350people evacuated from grand isle louisiana on september28 after rough surf associated with the distant cyclone began to threaten louisiana highway 1the only thoroughfare connecting grand isle with the louisianan mainland the following day oil companies operating offshore oil drilling platforms in the gulf of mexico began evacuating workers from the rigs to land on october1 a coastal flood watch was issued for portions of the united states coast due to the risk of storm surge from opal the united states coast guard issued an advisory for boaters in the gulf of mexico to use caution or remain in port where possible the next day the galveston texas emergency operations center opened to monitor the tropical cyclone and deliberate upon potential preparations for the city meanwhile the launch space shuttle columbias sts-73 mission set for october5 was postponed due to opals anticipated effectson october 3 a voluntary evacuation order was placed on plaquemines parish louisiana due to the risks of potential storm surge schools were also closed by noon that day across the parish voluntary evacuation orders for the florida panhandle which would ultimately be the most heavily affected area also began the same day with several counties giving evacuation orders farther west a mandatory evacuation order was placed on mobile county alabama by then-governor fob james just before noon october 4 with the hurricane near landfall escambia okaloosa and santa rosa counties halted evacuations instead ordering those still within vulnerable areas to seek shelter instead however the large amount of evacuees led to severe traffic congestion escambia county officials estimated that tens of thousands were still on evacuation routes within the county only a few hours before opal made landfall mass evacuations in some other counties concluded during the afternoon of october 4 though many evacuees in other locations were unable to reach safe areas prior to the onset of gale-force windsan estimated 100,000people evacuated from the united states gulf coast ahead of opal with 5 percent of evacuees seeking public shelters and over half of evacuees seeking shelter out of their home counties in their post-storm assessment the federal emergency management agencyfema noted that the landfalls of hurricane allison and hurricane erin on the florida panhandle earlier in the year produced a dichotomous mood toward preparations for hurricane opalsome people may have taken a wait and see approach that resulted in complacency while others affected by the widespread power outages caused by erin may have acquired a greater sense of readiness toward the approaching hurricane regardless the overall evacuation process was described as chaotic and the failure to clear hurricane evacuation routes of casual or communal traffic was blamed for the relative unease during evacuations for opal traffic congestion on these routes caused some evacuees to return to vulnerable areas along the coast while raising fears that stranded evacuees on highways could be subjected to potentially fatal hurricane-force windsthe post-landfall watches and warnings released in accordance with opal were a flash flood warning released on october 5 for portions of alabama northern georgia and the western parts of north carolina and south carolina the warning also included eastern tennessee a flash flood watch was also in effect for portions of the upper ohio valley the mid-atlantic region the central appalachians and the lower great lakes wind warnings were in effect for northwestern south carolina all the way to western new york a gale watch was also in effect for lake erie lake ontario and the southern sections of the st lawrence seawaysix hours later the gale warnings over lake erie lake ontario and the southern sections of the st lawrence seaway were upgraded into a storm warning for erie alone the gale warning for the other two sections remained the shoreline of lake erie was under a beach erosion warning from buffalo new york to ripley new york the storm prediction center released a tornado watch for northern and central new jersey and portions of new york and connecticut on october 6significant non-surge areas of escambia county florida south of us 98 were included in evacuation areas because of the potential for isolation by floodingalthough opal was only a weak tropical storm when it affected the yucatn peninsula its slow movement led to prolonged flooding rains over much of the region tabasco received about 20 percent of its annual rainfall in four days across campeche and tabasco more than 42,000 people were forced to evacuate as rivers overtopped their banks according to notimex an estimated 100,000 people evacuated due to the storm by october1 an estimated 500,000acres of crops had been destroyed by the floods in san francisco de campeche flood waters reached a depth of 6ft 1.8m governor jorge salomon ordered the closure of all government offices businesses and schools by october2 in light of the extensive flooding at least 60towns across the state were isolated by flooding by october 3 agricultural losses in campeche alone were estimated in the billions of pesos hundreds of millions of dollars at least 19 people perished across mexico while another 31 were killed in guatemalaabout 200 miles 320km of floridas coastline felt effects from hurricane opalrainfalls in florida peaked at 15.45 inches 392mm in ellyson 7.27 inches 185mm at pensacola and 6.64 inches 169mm at hurlburt field the highest gust recorded was a 145mph 233kmh gust at

surge to the area 8 feet 2.4m to 15 feet 4.6m in some areas comparing itself to hurricane eloise which struck the same area at near equal strength in 1975opal caused about us5.1billion 1995dollars in damage making it the third costliest hurricane at the time most of the structural damage occurred near the coastline on the florida panhandle due to intense surge amazingly enough nearly a mile of us highway 98 near eglin air force base was completely destroyed the pavement was nearly replaced by mounds of sand left behind after storm surge opal also spawned an f2 tornado that killed a young woman in florida none died as a direct result of storm surge this is quite unusual considering the strength and landfall location of opal okaloosa island fort walton beach was overwhelmed by storm surge numerous homes were under 3 feet 0.91m to 10 feet 3.0m of water residents were not allowed to return to the island until the homes could be secured a humver tour was arranged by the national guard so home owners could see the damage but the homeowners were not allowed off the bus sand dunes along the stretch of us 98 normally 25 feet 7.6m high were removed by wind and surge where once the ocean was obscured from view by the dunes for miles a flat open space opened up along us highway 98the peak rainfall from opal in alabama was 19.42 inches 493mm 3 miles 4.8km east-northeast of brewton alabama lesser amounts include 7.48 inches 190mm in mobile and 6.1 inches 150mm in anniston the highest gust reported was a 95mph 153kmh gust in fort rucker and a secondary one at maxwell air force

carolina over 17 inches 430mm of rain fell the rainfall included 9.89 inches 251mm in robinson creek and 8.95 inches 227mm in highlands the robinson creek rains spawned flash flooding officials in the state had the citizens boil their water before drinking it because of a possibility that floodwater may have entered purification plants a landslide triggered by opal and damaged the blue ridge parkway opal triggered a debris flow in the poplar cove area of macon county a flash flood from rainfall amounts typically ranged from four to six inches 152mm and closed roads and bridges were the result the most serious flooding apparently occurred in avery county where evacuations were required and tanks of propane were found floating in the banner elk riverthree deaths also occurred in the

middle rouge river crested one foot over flood stage causing the edward hines drive to be closed off to traffic high winds associated with the remains of hurricane opal affected the area during the late afternoon and early evening on the 5th strong northeast winds destroyed a new 200-foot 61-m two-story pole barn on the marine city highway in marine city the storm also cut power to several areas resulting in some school closings the maximum wind gust at detroit metro airport was a 38-mph 61-kmh gust which was from the northeast the damage from this incident totaled out to 15,000the remnants

in scattered parts of the county including route 57 near the tri-county firehouse downed wires caused power outages in hackettstown and mansfield townshipthe remnants of hurricane opal passed over northwest pennsylvania on thursday night 5th6th and caused wind gusts up to 50mph 80kmh and sustained winds of 20 to 30mph 32 to 48kmh heavy rains accompanied the storm and averaged 1.5 to 2.5 inches

issued in southern ontario and the upper st lawrence river in accordance with the remnants of opal by the canadian hurricane centre on october 5 the remnants also spawned a heavy rainfall warning by the ontario and the quebec weather centers for southern parts of both provinces but anticipated rain amounts would not be of the order of the ones associated with hurricane hazel 41years before the leftover system of opal spawned a gale warning for nova scotia toorainfalls were from 0.5 inches 13mm in northwestern ontario to 4 inches 100mm in southern parts of ontario and quebec less in new brunswick for example toronto received 78.6 millimetres 3.09in flooding basements and streets in quebec 80 millimetres 3.1in were recorded in montreal only 2 millimetres 0.079in short of the record set by hurricane frederic 16 years prior rainfall stretched out to the area of nova scotia but only up to 0.5 inches 13mm was reported thereacccompanying winds reached 83 kilometres per hour 52mph in toronto and up to 102 kilometres per hour 63mph in southern ontario feeling trees and power linesowing to the extreme destruction in the southeast united states and the death toll in mexico the name opal was retired in the spring of 1996 and will never again be used in the atlantic basin it was replaced with olga in the 2001 seasonopal was the first storm to be assigned a name beginning with letter o since hurricane naming began in the atlantic in 1950
