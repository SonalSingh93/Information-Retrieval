1692 the present counties were created by dividing the existing ones most recently union county in 1857 new jersey is the only state in the nation where elected county officials are called freeholders governing each county as part of its own board of chosen freeholders the number of freeholders in each county is determined by referendum and must consist of three five seven or nine membersdepending on the county the executive and legislative functions may be performed by the board of chosen freeholders or split into separate branches of government in 16 counties members of the board of chosen freeholders perform both legislative and executive functions on a commission basis with each freeholder assigned responsibility for a department or group of departments in the other 5 counties

was 566 before princeton township and princeton borough merged to form the municipality of princeton on january 1 2013 unlike other states all new jersey land is part of a municipality in 2008 governor jon corzine proposed cutting state aid to all towns under 10,000 people to encourage mergers to reduce administrative costs in may 2009 the local unit alignment reorganization and consolidation commission began a study of about 40 small communities in south jersey to decide which ones might be good candidates for consolidationstarting in the 20th century largely driven by reform-minded goals a series of six modern forms of government was implemented this began with the walsh act enacted in 1911 by the new jersey legislature which provided for a three- or five-member commission elected on a non-partisan basis this was followed by the 1923 municipal manager law which offered a non-partisan council provided for a weak mayor elected by and from the members of the council and introduced a council-manager government structure with an appointed manager responsible for day-to-day administration of municipal affairsthe faulkner act originally enacted in 1950 and substantially amended in 1981 offers four basic plans mayor-council council-manager small municipality and mayor-council-administrator the act provides many choices for communities with a preference for a strong executive and professional management of municipal affairs and offers great flexibility in allowing municipalities to select the characteristics of its government the number of seats on the council seats selected at-large by wards or through a combination of both staggered or concurrent terms of office and a mayor chosen by the council or elected directly by voters most large municipalities and a majority of new jerseys residents are governed by municipalities with faulkner act charters municipalities can also formulate their own unique form of government and operate under a special charter with the approval of the new jersey legislaturewhile municipalities retain their names derived from types of government they may have changed to one of the modern forms of government or further in the past to one of the other traditional forms leading to municipalities with formal names quite baffling to the general public for example though there are four municipalities that are officially of the village type loch arbour is the only one remaining with the village form of government the other three villages  ridgefield park now with a walsh act form ridgewood now with a faulkner act council-manager charter and south orange now operates under a special charter  have all migrated to other non-village formssocially new jersey is considered one of the more liberal states

legislature senate 2416 and assembly 4733 a 75 split of the states twelve seats in the us house of representatives and both us senate seats although the democratic party is very successful statewide the state had a republican governor from 1994 to 2002 as christie todd whitman won twice with 47% and 49% of the votes and in the 2009 gubernatorial election republican chris christie defeated incumbent democrat jon corzine with 48% in the 2013 gubernatorial election christie won reelection with over 60% of the votes because each candidate for lieutenant governor runs on the same ticket as the partys candidate for governor the current governor and lieutenant governor are members of the republican party the governors appointments to cabinet and non-cabinet positions may be from either party for instance the attorney general is a democratin federal elections the state leans heavily towards the democratic party for many years in the past however it was a republican stronghold having given comfortable margins of victory to the republican candidate in the close elections of 1948 1968 and 1976 new jersey was a crucial swing state in the elections of 1960 1968 and 1992 the last
