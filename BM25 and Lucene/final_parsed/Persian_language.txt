religious and literary language of the sasanian empire itself a continuation of old persian the language of the achaemenid empire its grammar is similar to that of many contemporary european languages persian gets its name from its origin at the capital of the achaemenid empire persis modern-day fars province hence the name persian farsi a persian-speaking person may be referred to as persophonethere are approximately 110 million persian speakers worldwide with the language holding official status in iran afghanistan and tajikistan for centuries persian has also been a prestigious cultural language in other regions of western asia central asia and south asia by the various empires based in the regionspersian has had a considerable mainly lexical influence on neighboring languages particularly the turkic languages in central asia caucasus and anatolia neighboring iranian languages as well as armenian georgian and indo-aryan languages especially urdu a register of hindustani it also exerted some influence on arabic particularly bahrani arabic while borrowing much vocabulary from it after the arab conquest of iranwith a long history of literature in the form of middle persian before islam persian was the first language in the muslim world to break through arabics monopoly on writing and the writing of poetry in persian was established as a court tradition in many eastern courts some of the famous works of persian literature are the shahnameh of ferdowsi the works of rumi the rubaiyat of omar khayyam the panj ganj of nizami ganjavi the divn of hafez and the two miscellanea of prose and verse by saadi shirazi the gulistan and the bustanpersian is one of the western iranian languages within the indo-european family other western iranian languages are the kurdish languages gilaki mazanderani talysh and balochi persian is classified as a member of the southwestern subgroup within western iranian along with lari kumzari and luriin persian the language is known by several namespersian the historically more widely used name of the language in english is an anglicized form derived from latin   latin   greek  persia a hellenized form of old persian  according to the oxford english dictionary the term persian as a language name is first attested in english in the mid-16th century native iranian persian speakers call it frsi farsi is the arabicized form of prsi subsequent to muslim conquest of persia due to a lack of the phoneme  in standard arabic ie the  was replaced with an  the origin of the name farsi and the place of origin of the language which is fars province is the arabicized form of prs in english this language has historically been known as persian though farsi has also gained some currency farsi is encountered in some linguistic literature as a name for the language used both by iranian and by foreign authorsin modern english the word farsi refers to the language while parsi or parsee describes zoroastrians particularly in south asiathe academy of persian language and literature has declared that the name persian is more appropriate as it has the longer tradition in western languages and better expresses the role of the language as a mark of cultural and national continuity some persian language scholars such as ehsan yarshater editor of encyclopdia iranica and university of arizona professor kamran talattof have also rejected the usage of farsi in their articlesthe international language-encoding standard iso 639-1 uses the code fa as its coding system is mostly based on the local names the more

the leading scholars of the persian languagewestern iranian languagesold persian cuneiformpahlavi scripts  manichaean alphabet  avestan alphabetpersian alphabet  tajiki cyrillic alphabetpersian is an iranian language belonging to the indo-iranian branch of the indo-european family of languages in general iranian languages are known from three periods usually referred to as old middle and new modern periods these correspond to three eras in iranian history old era being the period from sometime before achaemenids the achaemenid era and sometime after achaemenids that is to 400300 bc middle era being the next period most officially sassanid era and sometime in post-sassanid era and the new era being the period afterwards down to present dayaccording to available documents the persian language is the only iranian language for which close philological relationships between all of its three stages are established and so that old middle and new persian represent one and the same language of persian that is new persian is a direct descendant of middle and old persianthe known history of the persian language can be divided into the following three distinct periodsas a written language old persian is attested in royal achaemenid inscriptions the oldest known text written in old persian is from the behistun inscription examples of old persian have been found in what is now iran romania gherla armenia bahrain iraq turkey and egypt old persian is one of the oldest indo-european languages which is attested in original textsxenophon a greek general serving in some of the persian expeditions describes many aspects of armenian village life and hospitality in around 401 bc which is at a time when old persian was the only form of persian used he relates that the armenians spoke a language that to his ear sounded like the language of the persiansthe complex grammatical conjugation and declension of old persian yielded to the structure of middle persian in which the dual number disappeared leaving only singular and plural as did gender middle persian developed the ezfe construction expressed through  modern ye to indicate some of the relations between words that have been lost with the simplification of the earlier grammatical systemalthough the middle period of the iranian languages formally begins with the fall of the achaemenid empire the transition from old to middle persian had probably already begun before the 4th century however middle persian is not actually attested until 600 years later when it appears in the sassanid era 224651 inscriptions so any form of the language before this date cannot be described with any degree of certainty moreover as a literary language middle persian is not attested until much later to the 6th or 7th century and from the 8th century onward middle persian gradually began yielding to new persian with the middle-period form only continuing in the texts of zoroastrianismthe native name of middle persian was parsig or parsik after the name of the ethnic group of the southwest that is of pars old persian parsa new persian fars this is the origin of the name farsi as it is today used to signify new persian following the collapse of the sassanid state parsik came to be applied exclusively to either middle or new persian that was written in the arabic script from about the 9th century onward as middle persian was on the threshold of becoming new persian the older form of the language came to be erroneously called pahlavi which was actually but one of the writing systems used to render both middle persian as well as various other middle iranian languages that writing system had previously been adopted by the sassanids who were persians ie from the southwest from the preceding arsacids who were parthians ie from the northeast while ibn al-muqaffa eighth century still distinguished between pahlavi ie parthian and persian in arabic text al-farisiyah ie middle persian this distinction is not evident in arab commentaries written after that dategernot windfuhr considers new persian as an evolution of the old persian language and the middle persian language but also states that none of the known middle persian dialects is the direct predecessor of modern persian ludwig paul states the language of the shahnameh should be seen as one instance of continuous historical development from middle to new persiannew persian is conventionally divided into three stagesearly new persian remains largely intelligible to speakers of contemporary persian as the morphology and to a lesser extent the lexicon of the language have remained relatively stablenew persian is taken to replace middle persian in the course of the 8th to 9th centuries under abbasid rule with the decline of the abbasids began the reestablishment of persian national life and persians laid the foundations for a renaissance in the realm of letters new persian as an independent literary language first emerges in bactria through the adaptation of the spoken form of sassanian middle persian court language called dari the cradle of the persian literary renaissance lay in the east of greater iran in greater khorasan and transoxiana close to the amu darya modern day afghanistanthe mastery of the newer speech having now been transformed from middle into new persian was already complete by the era of the three princely dynasties of iranian origin the tahirid dynasty 820872 saffarid dynasty 860903 and samanid empire 874999 and could develop only in range and power of expressionabbas of merv is mentioned as being the earliest minstrel to chant verse in the newer persian tongue and after him the poems of hanzala badghisi were among the most famous between the persian-speakers of the timethe first poems of the persian language a language historically called dari emerged in afghanistan the first significant persian poet was rudaki he flourished in the 10th century when the samanids were at the height of their power his reputation as a court poet and as an accomplished musician and singer has survived although little of his poetry has been preserved among his lost works is versified fables collected in the kalila wa dimnathe language spread geographically from the 11th century on and was the medium through which among others central asian turks became familiar with islam and urban culture new persian was widely used as a trans-regional lingua franca a task for which it was particularly suitable due to its relatively simple morphological structure and this situation persisted until at least 19th century in the late middle ages new islamic literary languages were created on the persian model ottoman turkish chagatai and urdu which are regarded as structural daughter languages of persianclassical persian loosely refers to the standardized language of medieval persia used in literature and poetry this is the language of the 10th to 12th centuries which continued to be used as literary language and lingua franca under the persianized turko-mongol dynasties during the 12th to 15th centuries and under restored persian rule during the 16th to 19th centuriespersian during this time served as lingua franca of greater persia and of much of the indian subcontinent it was also the official and cultural language of many islamic dynasties including the samanids buyids tahirids ziyarids the mughal empire timurids ghaznavids seljuqs khwarazmians the sultanate of rum the shirvanshahs safavids afsharids zands qajars ottomans and also many mughal successors such as the nizam of hyderabad persian was the only non-european language known and used by marco polo at the court of kublai khan and in his journeys through chinadespite anatolia having been ruled at various times prior to the middle ages by various persian-speaking dynasties originating in iran the language lost its traditional foothold there with the demise of the sasanian empire centuries later however the practise and usage of persian in the region would be strongly revived a branch of the seljuks the sultanate of rum took persian language art and letters to anatolia they adopted persian language as the official language of the empire the ottomans which can roughly be seen as their eventual successors took this tradition over persian was the official court language of the empire and for some time the official language of the empire the educated and noble class of the ottoman empire all spoke persian such as sultan selim i despite being safavid irans archrival and a staunch opposer of shia islam it was a major literary language in the empire some of the noted earlier persian works during the ottoman rule are idris bidlisis hasht bihisht which begun in 1502 and covered the reign of the first eight ottoman rulers and the salim-namah a glorification of selim i after a period of several centuries ottoman turkish which was highly persianised itself had developed towards a fully accepted language of literature which was even able to satisfy the demands of a scientific presentation however the number of persian and arabic loanwords contained in those works increased at times up to 88%the persian language influenced the formation of many modern languages in west asia europe central asia and south asia following the turko-persian ghaznavid conquest of south asia persian was firstly introduced in the region by turkic central asians the basis in general for the introduction of persian language into the subcontinent was set from its earliest days by various persianized central asian turkic and afghan dynasties for five centuries prior to the british colonization persian was widely used as a second language in the indian subcontinent due to the admiration the mughals who were of turco-mongol origin had for the foreign language it took prominence as the language of culture and education in several muslim courts on the subcontinent and became the sole official language under the mughal emperors beginning in 1843 though english and hindustani gradually replaced persian in importance on the subcontinent evidence of persians historical influence there can be seen in the extent of its influence on certain languages of the indian subcontinent words borrowed from persian are still quite commonly used in certain indo-aryan languages especially urdu also historically known as hindustani there is also a small population of zoroastrian iranis in india who migrated around 16th-18th century to escape religious execution in qajar iran and speak a dari dialectin the 19th century under the qajar dynasty the dialect spoken in tehran rose to prominence this became the basis of what is now known as contemporary standard persianthere is still substantial arabic vocabulary but many of these words have been integrated into persian phonology and grammar in addition since the 19thcentury numerous russian french and english terms have been borrowed especially vocabulary related to technology the iranian national academy of persian language and literature is responsible for evaluating neologisms in order to devise their persian equivalentsthere are three modern varieties of standard persianall these three varieties are based on the classic persian literature and its literary tradition there are also several local dialects from iran afghanistan and tajikistan which slightly differ from the standard persian the hazaragi dialect in central afghanistan and pakistan herati in western afghanistan darwazi in afghanistan and tajikistan and the tehrani accent in iran the basis of standard iranian persian are examples of these dialects persian-speaking peoples of iran afghanistan and tajikistan can understand one another with a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibilitythe following are some languages closely related to persian or in some cases are considered dialectsiranian persian has six vowels and twenty-three consonantshistorically persian has distinguished length early new persian had a series of five long vowels     and  along with three short vowels   and  at some point prior to the 16th century in the general area now modern iran  and  merged into  and  and  merged into  thus older contrasts such as  shr lion vs  shr milk and  zd quick vs  zr strong were lost however there are exceptions to this rule and in some words  and  are preserved or merged into the diphthongs  and  which are descendants of the diphthongs  and  in early new persian instead of merging into  and  examples of the exception can be found in words such as   brighthowever in dari the archaic distinction of  and  respectively known as  y-ye majhl and  y-ye marf is still preserved as well as the distinction of  and  known as  ww-e majhl and  ww-e marf on the other hand in standard tajik the length distinction has disappeared and  merged with  and  with  therefore contemporary afghan dari dialects are the closest to the vowel inventory of early new persianaccording to most studies on the subject eg samareh 1977 pisowicz 1985 najafi 2001 the three vowels traditionally considered long    are currently distinguished from their short counterparts    by position of articulation rather than by length however there are studies eg hayes 1979 windfuhr 1979 that consider vowel length to be the active feature of the system with   and  phonologically long or bimoraic and   and  phonologically short or monomoraicthere are also some studies that consider quality and quantity to be both active in the iranian system such as toosarvandani 2004 that offers a synthetic analysis including both quality and quantity which often suggests that modern persian vowels are in a transition state between the quantitative system of classical persian and a hypothetical future persian which will eliminate all traces of quantity and retain quality as the only active featurethe length distinction is still strictly observed by careful reciters of classic-style poetry for all varieties including tajiksuffixes predominate persian morphology though there are a small number of prefixes verbs can express tense and aspect and they agree with the subject in person and number there is no grammatical gender in persian and pronouns are not marked for natural gendernormal declarative sentences are structured as s pp o v sentences have optional subjects prepositional phrases and objects followed by a compulsory verb if the object is specific the object is followed by the word r and precedes prepositional phrases s o  r pp vpersian makes extensive use of word building and combining affixes stems nouns and adjectives persian frequently uses derivational agglutination to form new words from nouns adjectives and verbal stems new words are extensively formed by compounding two existing words combining into a new one as is common in germanwhile having a lesser influence on arabic and other languages of mesopotamia and its core vocabulary being of middle persian origin new persian contains a considerable amount of arabic lexical items which were persianized and often took a different meaning and usage than the arabic original persian loanwords of arabic origin especially include islamic terms the arabic vocabulary in other iranian turkic and indic languages is generally understood to have been copied from new persian not from arabic itselfjohn r perry in his article lexical areas and semantic fields of arabic estimates that about 24 percent of an everyday vocabulary of 20,000 words in current persian and more than 25 percent of the vocabulary of classical and modern persian literature are of arabic origin the text frequency of these loan words is generally lower and varies by style and topic area it may approach 25 percent of a text in literature among the arabic loan words relatively few 14 percent are from the semantic domain of material culture while a larger number are from domains of intellectual and spiritual life most of the arabic words used in persian are either synonyms of native terms or could be glossed in persianthe inclusion of mongolian and turkic elements in the persian language should also be mentioned not only because of the political role a succession of turkic dynasties played in iranian history but also because of the immense prestige persian language and literature enjoyed in the wider non-arab islamic world which was often ruled by sultans and emirs with a turkic background the turkish and mongolian vocabulary in persian is minor in comparison to that of arabic and these words were mainly confined to military pastoral terms and political sector titles administration etc new military and political titles were coined based partially on middle persian eg  arte for army instead of the uzbek  qoshin  sarlakar  darybn etc in the 20th century persian has likewise influenced the vocabularies of other languages especially other indo-european languages such as armenian urdu and to a lesser extent hindi the latter two through conquests of persianized central asian turkic and afghan invaders turkic languages such as ottoman turkish chagatai tatar turkish turkmen azeri uzbek and karachay-balkar caucasian languages such as georgian and to a lesser extent avar and lezgin afro-asiatic languages like assyrian list of loanwords in assyrian neo-aramaic and arabic and even dravidian languages indirectly especially telugu and brahui as well as austronesian languages such as indonesian and malay persian has also had a significant lexical influence via turkish on albanian serbian croatian bosnian and serbo-croatian particularly as spoken in bosnia and herzegovinause of occasional foreign synonyms instead of persian words can be a common practice in everyday communications as an alternative expression in some instances in addition to the persian vocabulary the equivalent synonyms from multiple foreign languages can be used for example in iranian colloquial persian not in afghanistan or tajikistan the phrase thank you may be expressed using the french word  merci stressed however on the first syllable the hybrid persian-arabic phrase  moteakker am  moteakker being merciful in arabic commonly pronounced motakker in persian and the verb  am meaning i am in persian or by the pure persian phrase  seps-gozr amthe vast majority of modern iranian persian and dari text is written with the arabic script tajiki which is considered by some linguists to be a persian dialect influenced by russian and the turkic languages of central asia is written with the cyrillic script in tajikistan see tajik alphabetmodern iranian persian and afghan persian are written using a modified variant of the arabic alphabet which uses different pronunciation and additional letters not found in arabic tajik persian as used in tajikistan is typically written in a modified version of the cyrillic script there also exist several romanization systems for persian after the muslim conquest of persia it took approximately 150 years before persians adopted the arabic script in place of the older alphabet previously two different scripts were used pahlavi used for middle persian and the avestan alphabet in persian dndapirak or din dabireliterally religion script used for religious purposes primarily for the avestan but sometimes for middle persianin the modern persian script historically short vowels are usually not written only the historically long ones are represented in the text so words distinguished from each other only by short vowels are ambiguous in writing western persian  worm  generosity  cream and  chrome are all spelled   in persian the reader must determine the word from context the arabic system of vocalization marks known as harakat is also used in persian although some of the symbols have different pronunciations for example a ammah is pronounced  while in iranian persian it is pronounced  this system is not used in mainstream persian literature it is primarily used for teaching and in some but not all dictionariesthere are several letters generally only used in arabic loanwords these letters are pronounced the same as similar persian letters for example there are four functionally identical letters for   three letters for   two letters for   two letters for   on the other hand there are four letters that dont exist in arabic the persian alphabet adds four letters to the arabic alphabethistorically there was used also a special letter for the sound  this letter is used no more as the -sound changed to b ie archaic  zan   zbn languagethe persian alphabet also modifies some letters of the arabic alphabet for example alef with hamza below  changes to alef  words using various hamzas get spelled with yet another kind of hamza so that  becomes  even though the latter is also correct in arabic and teh marbuta  changes to heh  or teh the letters different in shape arethe international organization for standardization has published a standard for simplified transliteration of persian into latin iso 233-3 titled information and documentation transliteration of arabic characters into latin characters part 3 persian language simplified transliteration but the transliteration scheme is not in widespread useanother latin alphabet based on the common turkic alphabet was used in tajikistan in the 1920s and 1930s the alphabet was phased out in favor of cyrillic in the late 1930sfingilish is persian using iso basic latin alphabet it is most commonly used in chat emails and sms applications the orthography is not standardized and varies among writers and even media for example typing aa for the  phoneme is easier on computer keyboards than on cellphone keyboards resulting in smaller usage of the combination on cellphonesthe cyrillic script was introduced for writing the tajik language under the tajik soviet socialist republic in the late 1930s replacing the latin alphabet that had been used since the october revolution and the persian script that had been used earlier after 1939 materials published in persian in the persian script were banned from the countrythe following text is from article 1 of the universal declaration of human rights
