list of historic tropical cyclone names  wikipedia tropical cyclones are named for historical reasons and so as to avoid confusion when communicating with the public as more than one tropical cyclone can exist at a time names are drawn in order from predetermined lists and are usually assigned to tropical cyclones with one- three- or ten-minute windspeeds of more than 65kmh 40mph however standards vary from basin to basin with some tropical depressions named in the western pacific whilst tropical cyclones have to have gale force winds occurring more than halfway around the center within the australian and southern pacific regionsthe official practice of naming tropical cyclones started in 1945 within the western pacific naming continued through the next few years before in 1950 names also started to be assigned to tropical storms forming in the north atlantic ocean in the atlantic names were originally taken from the world war two version of the phonetic alphabet but this was changed in 1953 to use lists of women names which were created yearly around this time naming of tropical cyclones also began within the southern and central parts of the pacific however naming didnt begin in the eastern pacific until 1960 with the original naming lists designed to be used year after year in sequence in 1960 naming also began in the southwest indian ocean and in 1963 the philippine meteorological service started assigning names to tropical cyclones that moved into or formed in their area of responsibility later in 1963 warning centers within the australian region also commenced naming tropical cyclones in 2011 the brazilian navy hydrographic center started using naming list to name tropical cyclones over the south atlantic basinby 1950 tropical cyclones that were judged by the us weather bureau to have intensified into a tropical storm started to be assigned names storms were originally named in alphabetical order using the world war two version of the phonetic alphabet by 1952 a new phonetic alphabet had been developed and this led to confusion as some parties wanted to use the newer phonetic alphabet in 1953 to alleviate any confusion forecasters decided to use a set of 23 feminine names after the 1953 atlantic hurricane season public reception to the idea seemed favorable so the same list was adopted for the next year with one change gilda for gail however after storms like carol and hazel got a lot of publicity during the 1953 season forecasters agreed to develop a new set of names for 1955 however before this could happen a tropical storm was declared significant on january 2 1955 and was named as alice the new set of names were developed and used in 1955 beginning with brenda continuing through the alphabet to zelda for each season before 1960 a new set of names were developed in 1960 forecasters decided to begin rotating names in a regular sequence and thus four alphabetical lists were established to be repeated every four years the sets followed the example of the western pacific typhoon naming lists and excluded names beginning with the letters q u x y and z these four lists were used until 1972 when the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa replaced them with 9 lists designed to be used from 1972 in 1977 noaa made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the world meteorological organization to select the new sets of names which would contain male names and some spanish and french names in order to reflect all the cultures and languages within the atlantic ocean the world meteorological organization decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1979 since 1979 the same lists have been used with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names in 2002 subtropical cyclones started to be assigned names from the main list of names set up for that year in 2005 as all the names preselected for the season were exhausted the contingency plan of using greek letters for names had to be used since then there have been a few attempts to get rid of the greek names as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are considered generally unknown and confusing to the public however the lists of preselected names for the year are not expected to be used up frequently enough to warrant any change in the existing naming procedure and thus the greek alphabet will be used if the list of pre selected names should ever be used up againwithin the eastern pacific basin between the western coasts of the americas and 140w the naming of tropical cyclones started in 1960 with four lists of female names initially designed to be used consecutively before being repeated in 1965 after two lists of names had been used it was decided to return to the top of the second list and to start recycling the sets of names on an annual basisin 1977 after protests by various womens rights groups noaa made the decision to relinquish control over the name selection by allowing a regional committee of the world meteorological organization wmo to select new sets of names the wmo selected six lists of names which contained male names and rotated every six years they also decided that the new lists of hurricane name would start to be used in 1978 which was a year earlier than the atlantic since 1978 the same lists of names have been used with names of significant tropical cyclones removed from the lists and replaced with new names as in the atlantic basin should the names preselected for the season be exhausted the contingency plan of using greek letters for names would be used however unlike in the atlantic basin the contingency plan has never had to be used although in 1985 to avoid using the contingency plan the letters x y and z were added to the lists since the contingency plan had to be used in the north atlantic during 2005 there have been a few attempts to get rid of the greek names as they are seen to be inconsistent with the standard naming convention used for tropical cyclones and are generally unknown and confusing to the public however none of the attempts have succeeded and thus the greek letters will be used should the lists be used upin 1950 a tropical cyclone that affected hawaii was named able after a tropical cyclone had not affected hawaii for a number of years the system was also named salome by the air weather service office in guam before it became widely known as hurricane hiki since hiki is hawaiian for able typhoons olive and della of 1952 and 1957 developed within the central pacific but were not named until they had crossed the international dateline and moved into the western pacific basin during 1957 two other tropical cyclones developed in the central pacific and were named kanoa and nina by the hawaiian military meteorological offices it was subsequently decided that future tropical cyclones would be named by borrowing names from the western pacific naming lists hawaiian names were reinstated for the lists during 1979 with 5 sets of names drafted using only the 12letters of the hawaiian alphabet with the intent being to use the sets of names on an annual rotation basis however after no storms had developed in this region between 1979 and 1981 the annual lists were scrapped and replaced with four sets of names and designed to be used consecutively ahead of the 2007 hurricane season the central pacific hurricane center cphc introduced a revised set of hawaiian names for the central pacific after they had worked with the university of hawaii hawaiian studies department to ensure the correct meaning and appropriate historical and cultural use of the namesin the western north pacific ocean there are two sets of names generally used the first are the international names assigned to a tropical cyclone by the japan meteorological agency jma or the joint typhoon warning center jtwc the second set of names are local names assigned to a tropical cyclone by the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration this system often ends up with a tropical cyclone being assigned two names should a tropical storm threaten the philippineson january 1 2000 the japan meteorological agency as the official regional specialized meteorological center took over the naming of tropical storms the names selected by the world meteorological organizations typhoon committee were from a pool of names submitted by the various countries that make up the typhoon committeesince 1963 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa have assigned their own names to typhoons that pass through its area of responsibility unlike the world meteorological organizations standard of assigning names to tropical cyclones when they reach wind-speeds of 65kmh 40mph pagasa assigns a name to a tropical depression when they either form or move into their area of responsibility four sets of tropical cyclone names are rotated annually with typhoon names stricken from the list should they do more than 1billionpesos worth of damage to the philippines andor cause 300 or more deaths should the list of names for a given year prove insufficient names are taken from an auxiliary listduring its annual session in 2000 the wmoescap panel on north indian tropical cyclones agreed in principle to start assigning names to cyclonic storms that developed within the north indian ocean as a result the panel requested that each member country submit a list of ten names to a rapporteur by the end of the year 2000 at the 2001 session of the panel the rapporteur reported that seven of the eight countries had submitted their names however india had refused to submit a list of names as it had some reservations about assigning names to tropical cyclones due to the regional cultural and linguistic diversity of the panel members the panel subsequently studied the names and felt that some of the names would not be appealing to the public or the media and requested that members submit new lists of names at the following years session the rapporteur reported that there had been a poor response by member countries in resubmitting their lists of names in response the panel felt that it was important that the work continued and urged the members to copperate and submit their names to the rapporteur the names were subsequently submitted in time for the 2004 session however india had still not submitted their names despite promising to do so the rapporteur presented the 4 lists of names that would be used with a gap left for indias names and recommended that the india meteorological departments regional specialised meteorological centre in new delhi name the systems the rapporteur also recommended that the naming lists were used on an experimental basis during the season starting in may or june 2004 and that the lists should only be used until 2009 when a new list would be drawn up for the following ten years the naming lists were then completed in may 2004 after india submitted their names however the lists were not used until september 2004 when the first tropical cyclone was named onil by india meteorological departmentin january 1960 a formal naming scheme was introduced for the south-west indian ocean between africa and 80e by the mauritius and madagascan weather services with the first cyclone being named alix over the next few years the names were selected in various ways including by the meteorological services of the region for several years at a time before it was turned over to the wmos south west indian ocean tropical cyclone committee at the start of the 2000-01 seasontropical cyclones in the australian region are named by one of five tropical cyclone warning centers that each have the right to name tropical cyclones the naming of cyclones officially started during the 196364 tropical cyclone season with the first name being assigned on january 6 1964 to cyclone bessie female names were used exclusively until the current convention of alternating male and female names commenced in 1975 names that cause significant damage within the australian region are retired by the bureau of meteorology australia with new names selected at the bi-annual meeting of the world meteorological organizations ra v tropical cyclone committee in 2008 the lists used by the three tcwc centres were combined to form a single list of namestropical cyclones started to be named within the south pacific by the new caledonia meteorological office during the 195859 season the fiji office of the new zealand meteorological service subsequently started to also name cyclones during the 196970 season with alice being the first name to be usedduring march 2004 a rare tropical cyclone developed within the southern atlantic about 1,010km 630mi to the east-southeast of florianpolis in southern brazil as the system was threatening the brazilian state of santa catarina a newspaper used the headline furaco catarina which was presumed to mean furaco hurricane threatening santa catarina the state however when the international press started monitoring the system it was assumed that furaco catarina meant cyclone catarina and that it had been formally named in the usual way during march 12 2010 public and private weather services in southern brazil decided to name a tropical storm anita in order to avoid confusion in future references a naming list was subsequently set up by the brazilian navy hydrographic center with the names arani bapo cari deni and ea subsequently taken from that list during 2011 2015 and 2016
