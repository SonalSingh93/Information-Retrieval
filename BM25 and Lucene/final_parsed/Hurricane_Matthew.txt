hurricane matthew  wikipedia hurricane matthew was the first category5 atlantic hurricane since hurricane felix in 2007 caused catastrophic damage and a humanitarian crisis in haiti and also spread widespread damage in the southeastern united states the deadliest atlantic hurricane since hurricane stan in 2005 matthew was the thirteenth named storm fifth hurricane and second major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it caused extensive damage to landmasses in the greater antilles and severe damage in several islands of the bahamas who were still recovering from hurricane joaquin which had pounded such areas nearly a year earlier at one point the hurricane even threatened to be the first storm of category 3 or higher intensity to strike the united states since hurricane wilma in 2005 but matthew stayed just offshore paralleling the floridian coastlineoriginating from a tropical wave that emerged off africa on september22 matthew developed into a tropical storm just east of the lesser antilles on september28 it became a hurricane north of venezuela and colombia on september29 before undergoing explosive intensification ultimately reaching category5 intensity on october1 at just 13.4n latitude  the lowest latitude ever recorded for a storm of this intensity in the atlantic basin breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 matthew weakened slightly and fluctuated in intensity while making a northward turn toward the greater antilles remaining a strong category4 hurricane as it made its first landfall over haitis tiburon peninsula early on october4 and then a second one in cuba later that day matthew weakened somewhat but re-intensified as it tracked northwest making landfall in the northern bahamas the storm then paralleled the coast of the southeastern united states over the next 36 hours gradually weakening while remaining just offshore before making its fourth and final landfall over the cape romain national wildlife refuge near myrtle beach south carolina as a category 1 hurricane on the morning of october 8 matthew re-emerged into the atlantic shortly afterward eventually completing its transition into an extratropical cyclone as it turned away from cape hatteras north carolina on october9widespread effects were felt from matthew across its destructive path however the most significant impacts were felt in haiti with us1.9billion in damage and 546deaths making matthew the worst disaster to affect the nation since the 2010 earthquake the combination of flooding and high winds disrupted telecommunications and destroyed extensive swaths of land around 80% of jrmie sustained significant damage four people were killed in cuba due to a bridge collapse and total losses in the country amounted to us2.58billion most of which occurred in the guantnamo province passing through the bahamas as a major hurricane matthew spread damage across several islands grand bahama was hit directly where most homes sustained damage in the townships of eight mile rock and holmes rock preparations began in earnest across the southeastern united states as matthew approached with several states declaring states of emergencies for either entire states or coastal counties widespread evacuations were ordered for extensive areas of the coast because of predicted high wind speeds and flooding especially in the jacksonville metropolitan area in florida over 1million lost power as the storm passed to the east with 478,000losing power in georgia and south carolina while damage was primarily confined to the coast in florida and georgia torrential rains spread inland in the carolinas and virginia causing widespread floodinga vigorous tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 22 and moved rapidly across the atlantic being monitored by the national hurricane center nhc for possible tropical cyclogenesis despite possessing tropical-storm winds as it approached the lesser antilles on september 27 the wave could not initially be classified as a tropical cyclone as reconnaissance aircraft could not find a closed center however by 12:00utc on september 28 the wave developed a closed circulation while located near barbados hence becoming a tropical storm and was assigned the name matthew continuing westward under the influence of a mid-level ridge the storm steadily intensified to attain hurricane intensity by 18:00utc on september29 the effects of southwesterly wind shear unexpectedly abated late that day and matthew began a period of explosive intensification during a 24-hour period beginning at 00:00utc on september30 the cyclones maximum winds more than doubled from 80mph 130kmh to 165mph 270kmh making matthew a category 5 hurricane the first since hurricane felix in 2007 the rate of intensification has only been exceeded a few times in the atlantic since records began due to upwelling of cooler waters matthew weakened to a category4 hurricane later on october1 before attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 155mph 250kmh late on october 2slowly rounding the ridge matthew fluctuated in intensity within the category 4 range from october15 intensification resumed again late on october 3 and culminated when matthew made landfall near les anglais haiti around 11:00 utc on october 4 with winds of 150mph 240kmh and a pressure of 934 millibars 27.6inhg making it the strongest to hit haiti since hurricane cleo in 1964 continuing northward the hurricane struck mais in cuba early on october5 as a slightly weaker storm cubas and haitis mountainous terrain weakened matthew to category 3 status as it began to accelerate northwestwards through the bahamas restrengthening occurred as matthews circulation became better organized with the storm becoming a category4 hurricane again while passing freeport however matthew began to weaken again as an eyewall replacement cycle took place the storm significantly weakened while closely paralleling the coasts of florida and georgia with the northwestern portion of the outer eyewall coming ashore in florida while the system was a category3 hurricane with the strongest winds remaining just offshore matthew weakened to a category2 hurricane late on october7 and then to a category1 hurricane by 12:00utc on october8around 15:00utc on october8 the hurricane made landfall at cape romain national wildlife refuge near mcclellanville south carolina with winds of 85mph 140kmh and a central pressure of 963mbar 28.4inhg which made it the strongest to strike the united states in terms of pressure since hurricane isaac in 2012 and the first hurricane to make landfall north of florida in october since hurricane hazel in 1954 convection became displaced from the center as matthew pulled away from land due to increasing wind shear with the nhc declaring the system an extratropical cyclone about 200mi 320km east of cape hatteras north carolina on october9 the remnants persisted for another day before they were absorbed by a cold frontmatthew set several records during its long and destructive journey matthew intensified into a category5 hurricane at a latitude of 13.4degrees north breaking the record set by hurricane ivan in 2004 which had reached that intensity at a latitude of 13.7degrees north matthew also maintained at least category4 status for the longest duration on record for the month of october according to phil klotzbach of colorado state university doing so for roughly 5 dayson september27 prior to matthew becoming a tropical cyclone liat began cancelling flights across the
