rapid intensification  wikipedia rapid intensification is a meteorological condition that occurs when a tropical cyclone intensifies dramatically in a short period of time the united states national hurricane center defines rapid intensification as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 35mph 55kmh in a 24-hour periodin order for rapid deepening to occur several conditions must be in place water temperatures must be extremely warm near or above 30c 86f and water of this temperature must be sufficiently deep such that waves do not churn deeper cooler waters up to the surface wind shear must be low when wind shear is high the convection and circulation in the cyclone will be disruptedusually an anticyclone in the upper layers of the troposphere above the storm must be present as wellfor extremely low surface pressures to develop air must be rising very rapidly in the eyewall of the storm and an upper-level anticyclone helps channel this air away from the cyclone efficiently hot towers have been implicated in tropical cyclone rapid intensification though diagnostically has seen varied skill across basinsthe united states national hurricane center previously defined rapid deepening of a tropical cyclone when the minimum central pressure decreased by 42 millibars 1.240inhg over a 24-hour period however it is now defined as an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots 35mph 55kmh in a 24-hour period the term explosive cyclogenesis has been confused with rapid intensification in the literature however due to the redefinition based on sustained wind speeds rapid intensification is being applied to tropical systems while explosive cyclogenesis and associated terms to extratropical cyclonesin 1983 super typhoon forrest underwent one of the most explosive deepening events ever recorded with the pressure dropping from 975 to 885 millibars as it went from a tropical storm to a category 5 super typhoon in 24 hoursin 1992 hurricane andrew was just a minimum hurricane a day before making landfall in the bahamas when it began to rapidly deepen into a category 5 hurricane right up to its landfall at peak strength it weakened significantly over the island chain but it soon hit open water again and rapidly intensified back into a category 5 hurricane just hours before making a second landfall at category 5 strength in floridaon september 10 1997 hurricane linda was just a tropical storm the next day linda became a minimal hurricane by 6am on september 12

category two storm on the saffir-simpson scale of hurricane strength when just off the coast however its sustained winds rapidly increased from 110 to 150mph along with a pressure drop from 965 to 941mbar in only three hours charley caused unprecedented destruction in the punta gorda area and inflicted major damage across the state of floridaduring 2005 hurricane wilma sustained winds rapidly intensified from 60 knots 70mph 110kmh to 150 knots 175mph 280kmh within 24 hours as a result wilma intensified from being a tropical storm to a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale over the same time span the pressure dropped from 982 millibars 29.00inhg to 892 millibars 26.34inhg hurricane katrina and hurricane rita both rapidly intensified katrina from a category 2 to a 5 and rita from a 2 to a 5 katrina rapidly weakened as a result dropping one category every 6 hours rita kept cat 5 intensity for 24 hours before slowly weakening to a category 3 and dropping to a cat 1 just after landfallin 2006 the minimum central pressure of typhoon chebi in the western pacific dropped 75 mbar in 24 hours including a 60 mbar pressure drop in 6 hours as it intensified from a

the north indian ocean such as the 1999 odisha cyclone the strongest storm on record in the basin undergoing a 28 millibar pressure drop in 6 hours and cyclone giri undergoing 24 millibar drop in 6 hoursin may 2014 hurricane amanda rapidly intensified from a tropical storm to a category4 in 24hours over the span of 30hours its central pressure decreased by 62mbar hpa 1.83inhg while its winds increased by 95mph 153kmhin august 2014 hurricane genevieve underwent explosive intensification while crossing the international date line from a tropical storm to a category 5 typhoon in 30 hours
