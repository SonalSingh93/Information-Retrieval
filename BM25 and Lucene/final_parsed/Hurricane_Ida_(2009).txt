hurricane ida  wikipedia hurricane ida was the strongest landfalling tropical cyclone during the 2009 atlantic hurricane season crossing the coastline of nicaragua with winds of 80mph 130kmh the remnants of the storm became a powerful noreaster that caused widespread damage along coastal areas of the mid-atlantic states ida formed on november4 in the southwestern caribbean and within 24hours struck the nicaragua coast with winds of 80mph 130kmh it weakened significantly over land although it restrengthened in the yucatn channel to peak winds of 105mph 165kmh hurricane ida weakened and became an extratropical cyclone in the northern gulf of mexico before spreading across the southeastern united states the remnants of ida contributed to the formation of a noreaster that significantly affected the eastern coast of the united statesnumerous watches and warnings were issued during the hurricanes existence areas from panama to maine were affected by either the storm or the noreaster low in nicaragua nearly 3,000 people evacuated coastal areas ahead of the storm more extensive evacuations in mexico relocated over 100,000 residents and tourists in the united states several counties in louisiana alabama and florida declared a state of emergency because of fear of significant damage from the storm officials issued voluntary evacuations and most schools and non-emergency offices in the region closedin central america ida brought heavy rainfall to parts of costa rica nicaragua and honduras several people were reported missing in nicaragua however post-storm reports denied these claims thousands of buildings collapsed or sustained damage and roughly 40,000 people were left homeless damages from ida in nicaragua amounted to at least 46million crdoba 2.12million us aside from heavy rainfall in mexico and cuba little impact from ida was reported in either country in the united states the remnants caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic states one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others lost their lives in various incidents related to the noreaster widespread heavy rainfall led to numerous reports of flash flooding in areas from mississippi to maine overall the two systems caused nearly 300million in damage throughout the countryhurricane ida originated from a weak tropical wave that reached the western caribbean on november1 2009 by november2 the system spawned an area of low pressure north of panama which moved very little over the following days the low became increasingly organized within a favorable environment that allowed deep convection to develop by november4 the low had become sufficiently organized for the national hurricane center nhc to classify it as tropical depression eleven at this time the tropical depression was situated just southwest of san andrs island convective banding features became increasingly defined throughout the day and six hours after becoming a tropical depression the system intensified into tropical storm idalight wind shear allowed ida to quickly intensify as it slowly tracked towards the nicaraguan coastline late on november4 microwave satellite imagery depicted an eye-like featured forming within the storm the storm tracked west-northwestward in response to a weak ridge over the north-central caribbean sea and a weak trough over the southwestern gulf of mexico these features were also responsible for idas slow forward motion early on november 5 the storm intensified into a category1 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale as it passed near the corn islands at approximately 1117 utc the center of ida made landfall near rio grande nicaragua with winds of 80mph 130kmh after the hurricane moved inland the high mountains of nicaragua caused the convection associated with the hurricane to diminish resulting in rapid weakening roughly 18 hours after landfall ida weakened to a tropical depression as it turned northward over honduraslate on november6 ida re-emerged over water entering the northwestern caribbean sea upon moving back over water the storm quickly began to redevelop with convection increasing around the center of circulation early on november7 ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west of due north very warm sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification however wind shear over the area quickly increased resulting in modest strengthening later that day the storm turned northwestward in response to a strong trough over mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the southeast united states to hispaniola as ida neared the yucatn channel an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane by the morning of november8 the storm had attained category2 status with winds of 100mph 155kmhlate on november8 ida attained its peak intensity with winds of 105mph 165kmh and a barometric pressure of 975mbar hpa 28.79inhg shortly thereafter increasing wind shear and forward speed caused the storm to rapidly weaken to a tropical storm only a small area of convection remained near the center by the morning of november9 despite the strong shear the storm quickly re-organized attaining hurricane status for a third time during the afternoon based on readings from a nearby oil platform and reconnaissance data it was determined that ida attained its secondary peak intensity near the southeast coast of louisiana with winds of 85mph 140kmh however this intensification was short-lived as a combination of increasing wind shear and decreasing sea-surface temperatures induced weakening to a tropical storm within three hoursby the morning of november 10 all of idas convection appeared displaced to the northeast and the forward motion of the storm slowed substantially additionally the storm had begun to undergo an extratropical transition near the united states gulf coast shortly before making landfall near dauphin island alabama the storm completed its extratropical transition ida crossed mobile bay shortly thereafter and maximum winds decreased below gale-force after slowly tracking eastward for several hours the surface circulation of ida dissipated over the florida panhandle late on november 10 however energy from the storm led to the formation of a new low off the coast of north carolina this new low quickly intensified and became a powerful noreaster that caused substantial damage throughout the mid-atlantic states by november12 the system attained a minimum pressure of 992mbar hpa 29.29inhg along with winds of 65mph 100kmh the extratropical low weakened the following day and moved out to sea after stalling along the north carolina coastline the remnants of the cyclone persisted through november17 by which time it had moved over atlantic canadashortly after being designated as tropical storm ida on november4 the government of nicaragua issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coastline of nicaragua and the government of columbia also issued a warning for the nearby islands of san andrs and providencia later that day a hurricane watch was declared for areas between bluefields and the nicaraguahonduras border as ida moved closer to land the tropical storm warning for san andrs and providencia was discontinued several hours later the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were modified to cover areas south of the nicaraguahonduras border to puerto cabezas and a hurricane warning was issued for areas south of puerto cabezas to bluefields after ida made landfall in nicaragua all hurricane advisories were discontinued and replaced by a tropical storm warning shortly thereafter a tropical storm watch was declared for areas along the honduran coastline between limn and the nicaraguahonduras border however all watches and warnings were discontinued once ida weakened to a tropical depression on november6throughout nicaragua officials evacuated roughly 3,000 people from areas prone to flash floods and landslides as rainfall in excess of 20in 510mm was expected to fall about 1,100 of the evacuees were from corn island and little corn island where their homes were not expected to hold up to hurricane-force winds in bluefields roughly 1,100 people were evacuated to shelters authorities began stockpiling supplies such as food blankets and water that could supply 20,000 people after the storm upon the formation of ida officials in costa rica placed most northern regions under a yellow alert personnel from the costa rican red cross were also placed on standby in el salvador officials raised the disaster alert level to green the lowest stage of alert on november5 as ida neared the coastline of nicaragua officials in honduras warned residents of the likelihood of heavy rainfall from the storm in response to this the countrys disaster alert level was raised to yellowon november7 tropical depression ida re-entered the caribbean sea and restrengthened into a tropical storm prompting the nhc to issue a tropical storm watch for areas between san felipe yucatn and punta allen in mexico as well as in pinar del ro province cuba several hours later the watches were upgraded to warnings and a new tropical storm warning was declared for grand cayman a tropical storm watch was also issued for isla de la juventud and a hurricane watch for areas between tulum and cabo catoche mexico early on november8 the tropical storm warning and hurricane watch for mexico were modified to include areas from punta allen to playa del carmen and tulum to playa del carmen respectively a hurricane warning was also declared for areas between playa del carmen and cabo catoche later that day the tropical storm warning for grand cayman was discontinued as ida moved away from the island early on november9 all watches and warnings for cuba and mexico were discontinued as ida moved into the gulf of mexico and towards the united statesin mexico officials declared a yellow alert moderate hazard as hurricane ida neared the yucatn peninsula on november9 roughly 36,000 tourists and 1,500 residents were evacuated from coastal areas of quintana roo the mexican navy was placed on standby to assist in relief efforts once the storm had passed later that day the alert was raised to red the highest level as hurricane-force winds and heavy rains threatened the region a total of 95 shelters were opened in the state to house the evacueesas hurricane ida moved over the yucatn channel on november8 the nhc issued a hurricane watch for areas between grand isle louisiana and mexico beach florida as the storm moved closer to the states a tropical storm warning was declared for areas between grand isle and pascagoula mississippi as well as areas between indian pass florida and the mouth of the aucilla river the hurricane watch was also modified to encompass a smaller area between grand isle and pascagoula a hurricane warning was also issued from pascagoula to indian pass during the afternoon of november9 all hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued and the tropical storm warning was modified to include areas between grand isle and the mouth of the aucilla river as ida became extratropical the nhc discontinued all watches and warnings on the storm on november10due to the threat of large swells several oil rigs along the texas coastline were evacuated as a precautionary measure workers from the chevron corporation and the anadarko petroleum corporation were evacuated from offshore platforms while those working for conocophillips and exxonmobil remained on site the louisiana offshore oil port was also shut down on november9 as a result of idas passage as a result of the decreased oil production the price of oil rose more than 1 to 78 per barrel among the rigs that were damaged was the transocean marianas which was drilling the macondo well that vessel would be replaced on the macondo well by the deepwater horizon which caused the deepwater horizon oil spill in 2010on november8 lafourche parish louisiana president charlotte randolph declared a state of emergency for the parish as the storm approached the united states gulf coast although no evacuations were issued all schools and government offices were closed through november10 voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in plaquemines parish along coastal areas the belle chasse auditorium was converted into a shelter to house evacuees for the duration of the storm grand isle mayor david carmadelle issued voluntary evacuation orders for residents in recreational vehicles and trailers on the island nearly 1,400 families still living in temporary fema homes in louisiana in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita were urged to stay at homein baldwin county alabama a local state of emergency was declared on november9 as ida neared landfall voluntary evacuations were declared for residents living along coastal areas or in mobile homes all government offices were closed until november10 due to the storm the baldwin county coliseum was converted into a shelter to house possible evacuees during the storm as well in mississippi officials advised residents to remain vigilant and discussed possible evacuations residents living near pensacola beach florida and nearby perdido key were urged to evacuate on november8 emergency officials declared a state of emergency in escambia county the following day walton county was also placed under a state of emergency ahead of hurricane idas arrival voluntary evacuations were issued for residents in low-lying areas and all non-emergency offices were closed until november10 the freeport high school gymnasium was converted into a shelter to house evacueesthroughout nicaragua rainfall produced by the storm was significantly less than anticipated according to satellite derived estimates initial fears were that more than 15in 380mm of rain would fall however most areas received less than 5in 130mm especially further inland a maximum of 9.1in 230mm fell in puerto cabezas while areas further inland received less than 8in 200mm the most severe damage took place in karawala and corn island near where the storm made landfall there roughly 80percent of the structures were destroyed and over 2,000ha 4,900 acres of crops were lost on corn island 40 homes 3 schools and a church were destroyed and the electrical and water grids were severely disrupted roughly 6,000 people from the municipalities of sandy bay karawala kukra hilla laguna de perlas el tortuguero and the mouth of the rio grande were evacuated to 54 shelters during the storm officials stated that 42 people along the miskito coast were unaccounted for as they refused to evacuate before the storm the day after ida passed through officials began to assess the full extent of the hurricanes damage an estimated 40,000 people were left homeless throughout the country and one person was listed as missing mayors of severely affected towns reported that there were numerous injuries missing persons and extensive property damage in nicaragua there were no confirmed fatalities as a result of idadamage from ida in nicaragua was estimated to be at least 46million nicaraguan crdoba 2.12million usd a total of 1,334 people were injured by the storm throughout the country final damage assessments from the nicaraguan government for mainland nicaragua were completed on november12 a government report said that 283 homes were destroyed and 1,899 others damaged 1,184 latrines were destroyed and 444 were damaged and 476 wells were destroyed and 1,139 were damagedshortly after the storm moved inland 700 civil defense personnel were deployed to the affected region however due to damaged roads and poor travel conditions they struggled to reach isolated regions the nicaraguan army supplied relief crews with four helicopters and two an-2 aircraft for damage surveillance and search-and-rescue missions in the wake of ida the government of nicaragua allocated roughly 4.4million in relief funds for those affected by the storm several agencies from the united nations provided residents affected by the storm with relief supplies and donated disaster funds to the country the united nations population fund provided 49,000 in funds the world food programme deployed several rescue vehicles and logistics teams unicef also provided logistics assistance in the country ocha provided 2million in relief funds the government of sweden provided 400,000 swedish kronor 55,946usd for sanitation and health supplies the netherlands red cross also donated 20,000 euros 27,226usd for non-food itemsin costa rica the outer bands of ida brought torrential rainfall triggering isolated landslides one of these landslides damaged three homes leading to officials evacuating five families homes near los diques de cartago were flooded and the sewage system was damaged resulting in overflow in veraguas province panama severe flooding displaced more 400 people after 84 homes were inundated up to their roofs a flooding disaster that killed 124 people in el salvador was initially attributed to hurricane ida although the national hurricane center quickly affirmed that the event resulted from a separate tropical low-pressure system in the pacific after weakening to a tropical storm ida moved over honduras where widespread heavy rains fell a maximum rainfall of 7.1in 180mm was recorded in puerto lempira these rains caused some rivers in the country to swell but none overflowed its banks in northern areas of honduras minor flooding and fallen trees were reportedin cuba the outer bands of ida produced widespread heavy rainfall across western areas of the country a maximum rainfall amount of 12.5in 320mm fell in manuel lazo while nearby areas received between 7 and 9in 180 and 230mm strong winds gusting up to 87mph 140kmh in localized areas accompanied the storm during its passage several rivers were swollen due to the rains including the cuyaguateje river which overflowed its banks and flooded nearby areas in the yucatn peninsula significantly less rain fell due to the asymmetrical structure of ida even though the peninsula was relatively close to the storm isla holbox recorded substantial flooding with roughly 70percent of the island underwater however only minor damage was reported little to no beach erosion was sustained in coastal cities such as cancn however over 50,000 tourists were evacuated from chetumal quintana roo during the storm the outer bands of hurricane ida also affected grand cayman moderate rainfall and gusty winds were reported across the island and waves along the beach were estimated at 6ft 1.8mahead of idas arrival in the united states a tight pressure gradient between the hurricane and a high pressure system over the southeastern states resulted in strong winds across southern florida these winds reaching 45mph 75kmh in gusts caused moderate damage in parts of the state roughly 3,000 people were left without power in miami-dade broward and palm beach counties several trees were reported to have been downed and some uprooted one car was struck by a broken tree limb during the event additionally moderate beach erosion was reported in counties along the gulf coast rainfall from the system impacted florida for two days resulting in accumulations between 3 and 5in 76 and 127mm in parts of the panhandle a maximum rainfall of 5.41in 137mm fell in pensacola coastal and inland flooding resulted in numerous road closures and schools and non-governmental offices were closed on november10 water rise along the coast was estimated between 3 and 5ft 0.91 and 1.52m at the height of the storm following the storm a local state of emergency was declared in wakulla county throughout florida damage from the storm amounted to 265,000in alabama where ida made landfall heavy rains resulted in widespread flash flooding a maximum of 9.83in 250mm of rain fell in opelika during the storm several roads in coastal counties were closed after being covered by high water heavy rains in central areas of the state also resulted in moderate flooding in calhoun county a three-block area of anniston was inundated by 2.5ft 0.76m of water in addition to the storms heavy rains waves up to 20ft 6.1m caused severe damage along coastal regions a storm surge of 4.38ft 1.34m was recorded at bayou la batre the gulf state park pier near gulf shores recently re-opened after being destroyed by hurricane ivan in 2004 was damaged damage from beach erosion and coastal resorts amounted to roughly 9million in the statebefore making landfall in alabama hurricane ida brushed southeastern louisiana bringing light to moderate rains and increased surf to the state offshore one person drowned after attempting to assist a boat that let out a distress signal during the storm the rough seas resulted in moderate to severe beach erosion that caused roughly 1,000ft 300m of levee to collapse the levee collapse led to minor flooding and threatened three homes the storm cut a new pass through elmers island to grand isle between 100 and 200ft 30 and 61m wide a maximum sustained wind of 62mph 99kmh and a gust of 74mph 119kmh was recorded at the mouth of the mississippi river the highest rainfall total was recorded in venice at 1.16in 29mm although not solely caused by ida high tides along the texas coastline led to a few road closuresminor effects from ida were also experienced in mississippi georgia and tennessee in mississippi 4.13in 105mm of rain fell in waynesboro some flooding was reported in areas near the alabama border while winds of up to 45mph 75kmh brought down trees along the coast the hurricanes storm surge was estimated at between 3 and 3.5ft 0.91 and 1.07m heavy rainfall from the storm affected much of georgia with a large swath of 3 to 5in 76 to 127mm falling in northern parts of the state a peak of 7.32in 186mm was recorded in lithonia additionally minor rains affected parts of eastern tennessee totaling 4.11in 104mm on mount le contealong the east coast of the united states a noreaster involving the remnants of ida resulted in widespread damage along coastal areas in north carolina strong winds downed several trees loosened in saturated soil in rockingham county one person was killed after being struck by a branch while driving four homes were destroyed along the outer banks and over 500 others were damaged leaving at least 5.8million in losses widespread coastal damage and flooding took place in virginia as rainfall exceeding 7in 180mm fell in many places and large waves battered beaches in some areas roads were closed multiple times due to flooding minor damage was also reported as a few homes were inundated with up to 1ft 0.30m of water some areas reported a storm surge comparable to that of hurricanes gloria in 1985 and isabel in 2003 damage from the storm in virginia was estimated to be at least 38.8million of which 25million was in norfolk alone in new york one person drowned after being caught in rough seas off rockaway beach total beach losses in the state reached 8.2million
