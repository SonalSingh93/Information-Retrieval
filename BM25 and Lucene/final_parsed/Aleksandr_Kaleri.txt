participated in a wide array of research including fundamental physics biometric experiments and investigations of crystal growth in space as well as education outreachkaleri has participated in five spacewalks and has accumulated 23 eva hourson 8 july 1992 at 12:38 utc kaleri started his first career spacewalk during the spacewalk he and cosmonaut aleksandr viktorenko inspected some of mirs gyrodynes the spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 3 minuteson 2 december 1996 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut valery korzun completed a 5 hours 57 minutes long spacewalk the main purpose was to complete connections of the cooperative solar array to provide more electrical power to the mir station the spacewalk was kaleris second career spacewalkon 9 december 1996 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut valery korzun completed a 6 hours 36 minutes long spacewalk the spacewalk began at 13:50 utc and ended at 20:28 utc during the spacewalk the two cosmonauts completed connecting the solar array and attached a new kurs docking antenna subsequently used to guide progress vehicles docking with mir they also repaired the transceiver system that the mir crew used to talk to amateur operators all around the worldon 12 may 2000 kaleri and fellow cosmonaut sergei zalyotin completed a five-hour spacewalk to inspect the exterior of mir the two spacewalkers also tested a glue which would have been useful to

all but two of their planned tasks swapping out experiment packages and mounting an instrumented dummy torso on the stations hull to measure the radiation environment faced by spacewalking astronauts
