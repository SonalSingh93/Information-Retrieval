hurricane elena  wikipedia hurricane elena was an unpredictable and damaging tropical cyclone that affected eastern and central portions of the united states gulf coast in late august and early september 1985 threatening popular tourist destinations during labor day weekend elena repeatedly deviated from its forecast path triggering evacuations of unprecedented extent the hurricane wrought havoc to property and the environment between southwestern florida and eastern louisiana though lesser effects were felt well beyond those areas elena developed on august 28 near cuba and after traveling lengthwise across the island with little impact it entered the gulf of mexico and continued to strengthen initially projected to strike the central gulf coast the hurricane unexpectedly veered toward the east on august 30 then stalled just 50mi 80km west of cedar key florida despite predictions that elena would continue eastward across florida the cyclone remained nearly stationary for about 48 hours causing damage all along the eastern gulf with high winds and waves before slowly moving northwest and ultimately making landfall near biloxi mississippi on september 2 as a category 3 major hurricane the storm quickly weakened upon moving ashore and dissipated on september 4the hurricanes unpredictable shifts in direction created what was considered the largest peacetime evacuation in the nations history evacuations occurred in sequence to follow the storms forecast positions and many residents and tourists along portions of the gulf coast were forced to leave twice in a matter of days preparations were generally timely and efficient though accommodations and resources at storm shelters were stretched thin and many refugees tried to return home against officials orders about 1.25 million people fled the storm in florida alone contributing to a region-wide total of nearly 2 million evacuees tropical cyclone warnings and watches were continuously issued and adjusted and forecasters stressed the storms destructive potential for dayselenas slow movement off western florida resulted in severe beach erosion and damage to coastal buildings roads and seawalls especially to those of old or inadequate construction destruction was greatest near the shore and on islands such as cedar key and dog island though tornadoes spawned by the hurricane swept through communities and mobile home parks well inland the hurricane devastated the apalachicola bay shellfish industry killing large quantities of oysters destroying their reefs and leaving thousands of workers unemployed farther west dauphin island in alabama endured wind gusts as high as 130mph 210kmh and a significant storm surge the island sustained some of the most significant damage inflicted by elena including several hundred damaged or demolished homes the rest of the states coast also sustained considerable damage and the inland pecan and soybean crops were severely diminished in alabama and mississippiover 13,000 homes were damaged in mississippi and 200 were destroyed cities close to the alabama borderincluding pascagoulaexperienced widespread damage to residences schools and businesses and the community of gautier was effectively isolated from the outside world several apparent but unconfirmed tornadoes appear to have exacerbated the damage in the gulfport area wind damage extended into portions of eastern louisiana overall nine people died as a result of the hurricane two in texas due to drownings in rip currents three in florida two in louisiana one in arkansas and one in a maritime accident in the gulf of mexico damage totaled about 1.3 billion and power outages from the storm affected 550,000 people in elenas wake president ronald reagan declared parts of alabama mississippi and florida federal disaster areas making storm victims eligible for financial aid and temporary housing the name elena was later retired from the cyclical list of atlantic hurricane names because of the storms effectsthe origins of hurricane elena trace to an easterly tropical wave that was first identified off the western coast of africa on august 23 1985 the system sped westward across the atlantic at up to 35mph 56kmh its rapid motion combined with the presence of an unusually hostile saharan air layer prevented tropical cyclogenesis for several days driven by a strong subtropical ridge to its north the wave quickly approached north america as it began to show signs of organization at 00:00 utc on august 28 the disturbance developed into a tropical depression while over the windward passage the newly designated depression began to track west-northwestward over cuba which is known to disrupt tropical cyclone development despite that its central barometric pressure continued to deepen and reconnaissance aircraft found winds exceeding 50mph 80kmh near the center in response the national hurricane center upgraded the depression to tropical storm elena over northern cuba later on august 28after passing north of havana cuba elena emerged into the gulf of mexico at 12:00 utc on august 29 elena intensified into a category 1 hurricane analysis of steering currents through the morning of august 30 suggested that elena would continue on its northwestward track striking the area between new orleans louisiana and biloxi mississippi within 30 hours unexpectedly a mid-to-upper-level trough of low pressure diving in from the northwest created a weakness in the easterly currents allowing elena to recurve and slow drastically in forward speed roughly 24 hours after attaining hurricane intensity the storm abruptly turned east in response to the trough having defied initial forecasts hurricane elena drifted on its new course toward the coast of northwest florida forecasters now called for the trough to direct the hurricane across the florida peninsula and into the western atlantic however the relatively weak trough moved rapidly and instead of fully engaging elena its axis passed over the storms center further post-storm analysis of water vapor imagery suggested that the hurricane split the trough into two distinct segmentsextrapolation from the storms eastward progress yielded a projected landfall location near levy county however after the passage of the upper-level system early on august 31 steering currents slackened and elena became nearly stationary in the extreme northeastern gulf of mexico at its closest the center of the storm was around 50mi 80km from cedar key florida with maximum sustained winds estimated at 105mph 170kmh elenas intensity remained consistent and the cyclone was able to continue strengthening as soon as movement resumed early on september 1 elena reached category 3 major hurricane status an area of high pressure soon began to build over the eastern united states causing elena to slowly retrograde westward for much of september 1 the center of the hurricane was within range of the wsr-57 radar station in apalachicola florida enabling extensive study of small features within the eye and surrounding eyewall during that period of observation the previously unobstructed eye became cloud-filledthe hurricane accelerated on a trajectory toward the central us gulf coast sliding south of the florida panhandle during the afternoon of september 1 the hurricane attained its peak intensity with winds of 125mph 205kmh as confirmed by reconnaissance aircraft on the morning of september 2 elena approached coastal mississippi from the east-southeast still at major hurricane status it came ashore close to biloxi which was coincidentally within the hurricanes first forecast destination range before its extended detour once inland the hurricane immediately deteriorated weakening to a tropical storm just hours after landfall and its center rapidly filled the system curved northwestward over mississippi and louisiana and despite weakening it continued to ignite thunderstorm activity which spawned heavy rains elena persisted for several days before degenerating into a remnant area of low pressure on september 4 its associated cloud structure became distorted on september 5 and dissipated over kentucky that same nightthe unpredictable nature of the hurricane in conjunction with its arrival at popular tourist destinations on the labor day holiday weekend severely complicated preparations along the gulf coast evacuations and the hoisting of weather advisories inadvertently occurred in stages to keep up with elenas shifts in direction hurricane warnings were in effect at one point or another for every coastal location between morgan city louisiana and sarasota florida much of the northern gulf coast was under a hurricane warning on two separate occasions for two different trajectories of the storm evacuations of residents and vacationers also overlapped in many cases collectively this led to the largest number of people ever evacuated according to robert case some evacuees moved inland to meet relatives but many stayed relatively local filling hotels and designated shelters such as schools and churches despite the unusually fluid scenario officials were well aware of the storms destructive power days before its actual landfall national hurricane center hurricane expert bob sheets cautioned on august 30 that elena will be over a 1 billion stormduring elenas initial approach the first series of hurricane warnings were issued between grand isle louisiana and apalachicola florida the storms projected path quickly nudged westward prompting the warnings to be extended to morgan city louisiana and truncated to pensacola florida on their eastern reach heeding the advisories nearly one million residents and vacationers fled the storms path personnel on offshore oil rigs in the northern gulf of mexico began leaving as early as august 29 the governors of louisiana mississippi alabama and florida declared states of emergency by august 30 huge crowds formed at stores as individuals searched for emergency supplies and simultaneously lines grew at gas stations due to the impending danger many businesses closed and fortified their buildings across the gulf coast classes at schools were cancelled and residents in the new orleans area were particularly wary of what was being called the first serious hurricane threat in 20 years hurricane betsy caused catastrophic flooding in and around new orleans in 1965 in mississippi the mass exodus created bumper-to-bumper traffic on crucial highways such as the westeast us route 90 in florida then-governor bob graham activated 250 national guard troops on august 30 to facilitate efficient evacuations stating that 1,600 more were on standby by that time it became evident that elena would head farther east than initially expected stirring more concern for the eastern gulf coast accordingly hurricane warnings were dropped for coastal louisiana west of grand isle and replaced eastward to apalachicola floridaby the evening of august 30 after elenas sharp turn to the east hurricane warnings along most of the northern gulf coast were discontinued in accordance evacuees between louisiana and the four westernmost counties of the florida panhandle returned home as shelters closed with the storms new course the area of highest threat translated east to the remainder of the panhandle and the western florida peninsula as such governor graham recommended evacuations south to the tampa area late on august 30 a mandatory evacuation was then issued overnight for ten more coastal counties encompassing 573,000 affected individuals on august 31 governor graham advised residents in vulnerable areas of 15 inland counties to find safer ground in response to the heightening danger most of the national guard troops previously on standby were sent to block access to certain areas and an additional 3,000 were placed on standbyin the greater st petersburg pinellas county area alone 320,000 people evacuated ahead of the storm in what was a national record for the largest evacuation of a single county in history the large number of refugees from the storm put a strain on facilities highways and contingencies although the number of people required to leave far exceeded the capacity of pinellas county shelters only 120,000 of the 300,000 or more refugees made use of the shelters still official shelter usage was considered to be higher than average possibly due to shortened lead times limiting the ability of individuals to make arrangements with friends and relatives or increased awareness of available resources post-storm phone surveys indicated that evacuation order compliance rates were as high as 90% in pinellas county and the entire evacuation there took just 9 hours rather than the expected 15 with over 200,000 individuals recorded to be in more than 120 shelters along the coast of west-central florida evacuees became restless as a result of the duration of the storm supplies such as food ran short and many people ignored orders and tried to return home prematurely the threat of hurricane elena also triggered an unprecedented mass transfer of medical and nursing home patients tampa general hospital at 84% of patient capacity was evacuated four more hospitals and around 19 nursing homes in pinellas county were also cleared overall nearly 2,000 nursing home patients were transported to safety although successful the process encountered issues such as time constraints and staffing shortageslate on september 1 when the storm began to retrograde hurricane warnings were reinstated westward along the coast to grand isle louisiana as advisories along the west coast of the florida peninsula were allowed to expire by the time officials lifted evacuation orders the number of evacuees staying in shelters already decreased significantly due to the rampant eagerness and anxiety roughly 250,000 people in the florida panhandle 175,000 in alabama 70,000 in mississippi and 50,000 in louisianaa total of 545,000were ordered to leave several hundred thousand of the people affected by the new string of evacuation orders had also been forced to leave just days earlier and in extreme cases had one day or less reprieve governor grahams office reported that during the entire storm event 1.25 million people from florida evacuated at some point and state police in louisiana estimated that figure in their state to be around 400,000 in total nearly 2 million people fled the storm over its entire courseaccording to the hurricane research division of the atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory hurricane elena produced category 3 winds 111mph 179kmh or greater in florida alabama and mississippi the american red cross reported that in addition to the hundreds of single-family homes demolished by the hurricane over 17,000 sustained some degree of damage thousands of mobile homes apartments and condominiums were also damaged or destroyed a forecaster at the national hurricane center determined the worst of the hurricanes effects were focused around dauphin island alabama and pascagoula mississippi though noteworthy damage occurred across large areas of louisiana mississippi alabama and florida with effects documented as far west as south padre island texas and as far north as kentucky nine deaths were attributed to the hurricane in four states and on the waters of the gulf of mexico and 134 people along elenas path were hospitalized many of them due to storm-related stress power outages plagued the entire region affecting about 550,000 customers the national climatic data center compiled a total monetary damage figure of 1.3 billionin addition to its effects over land elena also affected offshore interests when a cargo ship close to the hurricanes center rolled in high seas on august 29 two unsecured storage containers collided crushing a man to death an oil platform operated by exxon and anchored off the coast of pensacola florida was ripped from its moorings and reported missing on september 2 the oil rig drifted 14mi 23km away before it was spotted by a coast guard aircraft exxon previously evacuated the platform after rough seas snapped the first two of its eight anchoring cables damage was reported on four other offshore platforms and a 6in 150mm oil pipeline broke during the hurricane at an estimated cost of 1.6 million the same pipeline broke two more times during the 1985 hurricane seasona large aspect of the hurricanes devastation was the havoc it wrought on the eastern gulf of mexico oyster industry particularly in the apalachicola bay area and off the coast of alabama elena subjected the apalachicola bay reefs to high winds strong tidal action and moderate to heavy rainfall churning up huge quantities of silt and mud which suffocated up to 90% of live oysters and virtually destroyed the most important harvesting sites commercial harvesting was suspended until may 1986 at which time some of the prominent reefs of the eastern apalachicola bay system were deemed able to sustain oyster-catching low astronomical tides amplified the effects of severe turbulence in the water thousands of individuals relying on the apalachicola bay oyster industry soon found themselves struggling to make a living losses in production at two major reefs were expected to surpass 30 million all of alabamas major reefs were affected by the hurricane and its most productive was nearly destroyed the problem was later confounded in november by hurricane kate which according to the national hurricane center dealt the final blow to certain oyster bedsthe storm began affecting florida late on august 28 and early on august 29 in key west on the east side of elenas strengthening center wind gusts exceeded 50mph 80kmh accompanied by 1.8in 46mm of rain and higher-than-normal tides several boats washed ashore at smathers beach similarly adverse conditions occurred throughout rest of the keys and across the southern florida peninsula 60mph 100kmh wind gusts and modest rainfall stretched as far east as the miami area easterly winds produced significant wave heights of 5.2ft 1.6m at west palm beach and 10.5ft 3.2m at jacksonville along the atlantic coast of florida by august 31outer rainbands of the large hurricane produced squally weather over parts of northern florida as early as the morning of august 30 by then the low-lying coastline near apalachicola already began to flood elena would continue to affect the state for several days as it meandered offshore resulting in moderate to heavy rainfall upwards of 10in 250mm accumulated in many locations peaking at 15.67in 398mm near cross city and reaching 11.31in 287mm at apalachicola farther south in the tampa area the precipitation was less significant exceeding 5in 130mm at clearwater parts of the states northeastern coastfarther away from the hurricanes centeralso saw formidable rainfall with a local maximum of 10.57in 268mm at jacksonville still those totals represented a relatively dry storm considering its long duration despite initial hopes that the hurricane would help alleviate drought conditions across interior portions of southern florida precipitation there was generally inconsequentialstorm-heightened tides extended along the florida coast as far south as sarasota and generally ran a modest 3 to 6ft 0.91 to 1.83m above normal though their duration and extent proved noteworthy the highest recorded storm surge associated with the hurricane was 10ft 3.0m at apalachicola the combination of raised water levels and strong waves resulted in severe erosion along many beaches many homes near the water were destroyed by the surge and shoreline structures such as docks causeways bridges low-lying roads and seawalls sustained substantial damage several large fishing piers were either partially or totally destroyed notably the city pier at cedar key and the popular 1,500ft 460m big indian rocks fishing pier were both demolished by the hurricane debris from the big indian rocks fishing pier drifted northward toward clearwater pass and accumulated along private beaches at belleair shorethe storms strongest winds remained largely over open waters although severe gusts still brushed coastal cities and barrier islands the strongest winds were observed in two areas of the coast from cedar key to clearwater and from apalachicola to pensacola official gust reports included 75mph 121kmh at cedar key and nearly 70mph 110kmh at clearwater later on september 2 a gust of 90mph 140kmh was observed at pensacola along the florida panhandle with sustained winds exceeding 50mph 80kmh winds in franklin county approached 125mph 201kmh by unofficial estimates the storms effects were not limited to the shore however as fallen trees in the inland tallahassee area damaged around 50 vehiclesthough hurricane elena never crossed floridas coast its drawn-out interaction with land agitated large swaths of the states western shore winds along and around the pinellas county coast generally blew from the south or southwest for several days creating persistent onshore flow that built up heavy seas near clearwater waves reached 8.2ft 2.5m in height marked by a period of 13 seconds on august 31 one study determined that the storm removed an average of 10 cubic yards of coastal material per linear foot of shoreline in escambia county gulf franklin and pinellas counties with values peaking at 15.6 cubic yards per foot along the predominantly marshy coasts of pasco hernando and citrus counties erosion and structural damage were much more limited partly due to the local southerly or southeasterly wind directionin some cases the hurricane left quasi-permanent alterations on beaches and small islands for example north bunces keyan island of southern pinellas countylost most of its vegetation to the storm and overwashing shifted the southern part of the island up to 330ft 100 m from its original settlement more extensive changes were seen on and near caladesi island which formed in 1921 after a hurricane split a larger barrier island into two by a new channel the inlet became dominant over dunedin pass to the south which grew narrower very gradually until elena rearranged the dynamics of the beach allowing dunedin pass to fill completely with sand within a couple years of the hurricanes passage as a result clearwater beach became connected to caladesi island elena also created a new inlet known as willys cut which existed until 1991 interest in artificially reopening dunedin pass prompted an official study in 1994 on the engineering and financial merits of such a project due to the high cost of dredging and the likelihood of nearly continuous maintenance no action was takenthe hurricane tore two barges from their moorings in tampa bay and blew them into gandy bridge leaving the bridge with unspecified damage throughout the area rising waters inundated streets washed boats ashore and destroyed numerous homes along the coast at low-lying cedar key to the north storm surge exceeded 9ft 2.7m there and at alligator point to the northwest the surge values represented return periods of 25 to 30 years elsewhere they were equivalent to about 10-year events floodwaters in cedar key rose to 8ft 2.4m in depth with 2ft 0.61m waves atop the standing water the extent of structural damage was largely dependent on construction type as newer elevated buildings fared much better than older structures nearer sea level waterfront restaurants were especially susceptible winds blew out several large sliding-glass doors at one establishment allowing both the winds and the tide to enter its interior elena severed the sole bridge to cedar key temporarily isolating the city and stranding several residents the florida department of transportation hurriedly worked to make the bridge passable long enough to rescue the stranded individuals the hurricane compromised several other roads destroying a 75ft 23m section of state road 24 monetary losses in cedar key alone were estimated at 2 million and all major aspects of local infrastructure were severely affected initially preventing residents from returning home to the island at least 34 homes and businesses on the island were damaged or destroyedpinellas county suffered some of the worst damage from hurricane elena in florida at the height of the storm over 500,000 of its residents were without electricity forty-four single-family homes were destroyed 31 more were damaged and several condominiums townhouses and commercial buildings were damaged or destroyed the hurricane also wrecked or irreparably compromised nearly 2.7mi 4.3km of coastal bulkheads and inflicted minor damage on 2.15mi 3.46km more most of the affected seawalls were degrading or poorly reinforced seawalls with higher standards of construction generally remained intact though even in those cases overwash from the gulf of mexico topped the barriers and deposited large volumes of sand the hurricane cost roughly 100 million in pinellas countyelenas track parallel to the florida panhandle subjected the coastline between apalachicola and pensacola beach to particularly severe conditions that resulted in significant property damage there in apalachicola proper winds tore large roofs off buildings and data from floridas department of natural resources indicate that 20 residences and one community building in franklin county were damaged or destroyed structural failure was prevalent along the countys waterfront and on islands such as dog island however it was mainly limited to poorly constructed buildings several miles of roadways in the county sustained significant damage and about  mile 800m of bulkhead was destroyed low seawalls allowed crucial points of the causeway to st george island to erode causing it to fail in escambia county the hurricane left 2 million in damages throughout much of the remainder of the florida panhandle structural damage was limited though 100,000 people in the pensacola area lost power the configuration of the southern tip of cape san blas in gulf county was changed by the storm the hurricane wiped out eagle nests generated freshwater fish kills and affected other species of wildlife at the st vincent and st marks national wildlife refuges st george island and honeymoon island state parks were heavily affected with appreciable but lesser damage in numerous other protected areas us route 98 which closely follows the coast in this region required extensive repairs after being undermined in nearly two dozen locationswhen tropical cyclones move over land they often produce the wind shear and atmospheric instability required for the development of weak embedded supercell thunderstorms which can produce tornadoes these tornadoes are usually weak and short-lived but still capable of producing significant damage while centered over the gulf of mexico the eastern side of hurricane elenas circulation spawned several such tornadoes over central florida a tornado struck just east of leesburg on september 1 destroying 64 single-family houses and mobile homes and damaging another 118 seven people were treated for non-life-threatening injuries later that same day another tornado touched down over downtown leesburg with much less damage in nearby marion county tornadic activity destroyed six mobile homes compromised another 50 residences and inflicted as much as 500,000 in total losses though only minor injuries were reported at kennedy space center launch complex 39 in cape canaveral a weak tornado struck two vehicles near the location where space shuttle atlantis was being prepared for its first flight a tornado in new port richey tore parts of the roof off at least one building and brought down trees and tornadic activity was also identified in sumter countythe hurricane took one life in the state and indirectly contributed to two additional deaths in daytona beach a tree struck a parked vehicle killing a person inside the exact cause of the trees uprooting was unknown although it may have been hit by lightning or a short-lived tornado elsewhere two individuals died of heart attacks one while installing storm shutters on his home and another at a designated shelterthe center of elena passed 30mi 50km south of mainland alabama as it accelerated toward the gulf coast affecting the states two-county coast and offshore islands wind gusts at dauphin island situated much closer to the hurricanes eye were estimated to have reached 130mph 210kmh these velocities represented some of the highest experienced on land from the storm and were strong enough to snap hundreds of large pine trees dauphin island received an 8.4ft 2.6m storm surge that resulted in substantial flooding and areas of total overwash rainfall amounted to just 3in 76mm on the islandwith its location close to the storms center dauphin island saw the greatest damage in alabama access to the island was shut down during and immediately after the hurricane slowing the progression of damage assessments additionally the storm cut power and phone services post-storm surveys revealed discernible patterns in structural damage on the island these included a nearly complete lack of destruction on the heavily wooded eastern end and damage concentrated closer to the western side and along areas exposed to strong easterly winds first-hand accounts relayed that in the most severe cases entire elevated homes were torn from their pilings and swept into the gulf of mexico the number of homes demolished in that manner was informally placed at 50 though such total building collapses were typically confined to poorly secured buildings in total the hurricane destroyed 190 residences on dauphin island accounting for nearly 25% of all homes and a further 235 sustained substantial damage an unofficial and early estimate of losses on the island was 30 millionwindspeeds were markedly lower over mainland alabama mobile recorded winds of over 50mph 80kmh with gusts as high as 84mph 135kmh the storms angle of approach created strong offshore winds along the mainland which depressed water levels and limited the extent of positive surge once winds shifted to onshore winds from the hurricane took a toll on crops ruining 8,000,000lb 3,600,000kg of pecans and reducing soybean production by 10% farms were still in the process of recovering from hurricane frederic in 1979 when elena struckwave action took a toll on the foundations of waterfront structures along the coasts of baldwin and mobile counties where elena inflicted about 715,000 worth of damage to roadways most damage was concentrated near the shore where extensive erosion took place and on islands and minor peninsulas farther inland elenas impact was generally limited to downed trees and power lines the storm destroyed the city boardwalk at gulf shores with the cost of rebuilding expected to approach 300,000 alabama power reported extensive power outages affecting up to 100,000 customers according to the insurance information institute storm-related damages in alabama totaled about 100 million an estimated 300 homes in the state were destroyed by hurricane elena and another 1,345 sustained lighter damagealong the coast of mississippi where elena made landfall the most significant effects of the storm stemmed from its strong winds gusting to over 120mph 190kmh recorded gusts included 121mph 195kmh at gulfport 115mph 185kmh at pascagoula and 90mph 140kmh at biloxi several other weather stations clocked sustained winds at over 90mph 140kmh consistent with the storms dry nature rainfall in the state was mainly light and confined to southern and western areas gulfport picked up more than 4.5in 110mm while just over 3 in 75mm of rain fell at natchez some streets in gulfport and biloxi flooded at the height of the storm the highest tides ran 6 to 8ft 1.8 to 2.4m above normal along the coast reaching 7.9ft 2.4m above average at pascagoula and ocean springs as in alabama negative surge values were recorded at the storms onset the tide gauge at gulfport recorded a water level of 5.6ft 1.7m below average early on september 2 before quickly swelling to 5.43ft 1.66m above normal air pressure reportedly fell so rapidly at pascagoula that car windows began to shatter the barometer there bottomed out at 953 mb the lowest pressure recorded on land in association with the cyclonethe worst of the damage occurred along a 40mi 64km stretch of coastline centered on the pascagoula area elenas winds damaged most of the schools in jackson county and more specifically every school in pascagoula was structurally compromised to some degree damages to schools in ocean springs totaled 3 million in the same city the overall conditions following the hurricane were described as worse than those in the prior hurricanes frederic or camille elena destroyed 20 houses and two supermarkets in ocean springs and several buildings on every city block sustained severe roof damage due to fallen trees two shopping centers were destroyed in nearby gautier possibly by short-lived tornadoes a fire captain in gautier remarked immediately after the storm that he had not yet seen an unharmed building in the city the community became essentially isolated from the outside world and quickly began to run short of food clean water and gasoline supplies initial reports from pascagoula also indicated that most or all of that citys buildings were damaged nearly every business in the city was damaged to the extent that none were able to open when the storm cleared a post-storm assessment by the mississippi emergency management agency revealed over 900 businesses in jackson county sustained damage contributing to a total of nearly 1,500 in the states three coastal countiesharrison and hancock counties were generally not affected quite as severely as communities closer to the alabama border but the entire area still suffered extensively in sections of gulfport large fires were sparked by downed power lines and fed by broken natural gas pipes debris on roadways prevented firefighters from reaching the fires allowing them to spread similar destruction was seen to the east at biloxi where the hurricanes winds tore the roofs off many buildings beachfront communities were in a state of disarray with large trees uprooted debris littering the ground and accumulations of sand on parts of roads like us 90 damage to schools in harrison countyparticularly in gulfport and biloxiwas extensive most homes in the area survived the storm which was locally estimated to have been a once-in-50-year event with relatively little damage several buildings along the coast in the biloxi area sustained severe damage but many of the older houses near the gulf of mexico there fared remarkably well winds brought down large highway signs in some cases striking nearby buildings along the coast elena caused beach erosion damaged coastal structures and recreational beach facilities and dislocated navigational buoys and markers in various ports several of which were closed pending coast guard inspection winds over inland pearl river county damaged 350 permanent and mobile homes and as in alabama the hurricane took a large toll on pecan and soybean crops and farmsthere were numerous reports in southern mississippi of embedded tornadoes that exacerbated the hurricanes effects reports in gulfport indicated that three schools actively being used as hurricane shelters were struck and damaged by tornadoes at one location almost 400 people being housed in a school had to rush to safety before part of its roof collapsed another apparent tornado sideswiped a senior citizens center endangering nearly 200 people in a structure that sustained damage to windows doors and part of its roof about 20 people required rescue by paramedics only minor injuries occurred in association with the possible tornadoes teams of experts tasked with reviewing the validity of tornado reports were largely unable to prove that a significant portion of the damage in southern mississippi had been done by tornadoes as a result few tornadoes were confirmed and it is likely that most of the damage in the region resulted from squall-like winds that are part of an intense hurricanes nature or potentially localized microbursts any unconfirmed tornadoes would have been no stronger than the hurricanes synoptic windsthe storm left 80,000 mississippi power company customers without electricity most of jackson countys 126,000 residents were affected by the outage operations at ingalls shipbuilding in pascagoula were halted due to the power outage and widespread damage to the shipyards buildings and cranes and at least two other shipyards in the state were affected by the hurricane additionally the storm forced the temporary closure of the chevron usa refinery at pascagoula facilities at horn island in the gulf islands national seashore buccaneer state park and the mississippi sandhill crane national wildlife refuge required repairs following the storm at the latter damages included the cost of healing a florida sandhill cranes injured leg thirty seafood processing plants were damaged and one was destroyed the red cross estimated that 200 single-family houses in the state were destroyed and some 13,200 were damaged 1,200 of them heavily additionally the hurricane demolished 390 mobile homes and damaged another 2,290 the overall cost of damage in mississippi alone approached 1 billionafter moving inland the storms northwestward track brought it over the louisiana border on two separate occasions first reaching washington parish as a minimal hurricane winds there were strong enough to bring down hundreds of trees damaging houses and knocking out power to over 15,000 customers in the process the hurricane also overturned mobile homes and strewn debris throughout communities such as bogalusa and franklinton in washington parish the hardest-hit area in the state downed trees caused damage to 200 homes and another 200 businesses chiefly near bogalusawinds across the rest of the state were moderate gusting to around 50mph 80kmh at slidell on the northeastern shore of lake pontchartrain so damage outside of washington parish was sporadic throughout the state at least 40,000 electric customers lost power located southwest of the storms core new orleans escaped with little damage and relatively benign weather conditions still the hurricane triggered minor flooding and brought down tree limbs around the city levees along the shores of lake pontchartrain were able to contain the lakes large waves despite initial fears to the contrary still the adverse conditions forced the temporary closure of the lake pontchartrain causeway the storm led to the deaths of two individuals in the state one due to a drowning in st tammany parish and another in a traffic accident attributed to the weather insured and uninsured damages were worth near 17 million combined with an additional 500,000 in agricultural losseselena subjected the chandeleur islands to a 6.5ft 2.0m or greater storm surge the island chain is an important buffer to parts of mainland louisiana against storms but is frequently reshaped or shrunken by intense hurricanes hurricane danny and hurricane juan also affected the islands in 1985 elena eroded away at least 20% and possibly up to 40% of the chandeleur islands total land mass and cut 30 significant channels into the island chain parts of the islands left intact suffered extensive loss of vegetation the hurricane along with danny and juan also affected several other barrier islands and elena itself removed as much as 112ft 34m of beach along the

period due to the storm shelters were opened to those displaced by the flooding but scarcely usedearly in its formative stages elena triggered rainshowers and thunderstorms over parts of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola later the mature hurricane generated strong rip currents as far away as south padre island texas where two swimmers drowned in separate incidents over the labor day weekend both victims were male texas residentshurricane elena has a multifaceted legacy it is remembered not only for its severe impacts but also for its unpredictability and the wide extent of pre-storm preparations due to its notoriety the name elena was retired from the cyclical list of atlantic hurricane names in the spring of 1986 consequently it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was replaced by erika which was first used during the 1991 seasonthe state of florida received a federal major disaster declaration on september 12 franklin levy manatee and pinellas

created a 13% drop in visitors between october 1984 and october 1985 in pinellas county marking an early end to the annual tourist season which generally ends after labor day weekend tourist spending fell accordinglyafter the storm residents were allowed to return to their neighborhoods on a by-town basis once authorized to enter their communities many individuals inadvertently gained access to other municipalities in the area that were not ready for the return of civilians in turn dangerous situations arose amid preliminary cleanup operations in pinellas county laws were proposed to unify the municipal decisions to accept residents after future disasters as part of the proposed laws the county sheriff as opposed to local officials would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen despite extensive resistance county commissioners approved the change giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders an additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies during hurricane elena intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane partiesto help the apalachicola bay

hurricane power was restored to most areas by september 4 with an exception being st georges island service was expected to be restored after several additional days more broadly owners of heavily damaged homes in the state faced new regulations on coastal construction in the state which went into effect less than a month after the storm the new rules entailed more rigorous study of factors such as a propertys prior history and surrounding buildings before approval to rebuild a demolished structure would be granted governor graham preliminarily advised that houses more than halfway destroyed not be rebuilt recovery efforts after hurricane elena continued to a small degree for years after its passage for example beach replenishment at indian rocks beach in pinellas county began in the summer of 1990power companies from several states sent workers to help restore service to the hardest-hit areas of the gulf coast most of alabama powers affected customers had power within 24 hours of the storm though restoration of service to dauphin island took significantly longer power was fully restored to central louisiana electric customers by september 4 alabamas two coastal counties were declared federal disaster areas on september 7 special loan assistance was made available by the small business administration and the farmers home administration the latter of which

without electricity by september 5by september 5 the salvation army red cross and other organizations had served 100,000 meals to those displaced by the hurricane in mississippi and federal food stocks became available for the state to distribute to storm victims still resources such as food and ice started to run short in the hardest-hit locations and long lines formed at the first few
