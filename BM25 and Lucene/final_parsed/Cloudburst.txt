cloudburst  wikipedia a cloudburst is an extreme amount of precipitation in a short period of time sometimes accompanied by hail and thunder that is capable of creating flood conditions a cloudburst can suddenly dump large amounts of water eg 25mm of precipitation corresponds to 25000 metric tonskm 1 inch corresponds to 72,300short tons over one square mile however cloudbursts are infrequent as they occur only via orographic lift or occasionally when a warm air parcel mixes with cooler air resulting in sudden condensation at times a large amount of runoff from higher elevations is mistakenly conflated with a cloudburst the term cloudburst arose from the notion that clouds were akin to water balloons and could burst resulting in rapid precipitation though this idea has since been disproven the term remains in userainfall rate equal to or greater than 100 millimetres 3.9in per hour is a cloudburst however different definitions are used eg the swedish weather service smhi defines the corresponding swedish term skyfall as 1mmmin for short bursts and 50mmh for longer rainfalls the associated convective cloud can extend up to a height of 15 kilometres 9.3mi above the groundduring a cloudburst more than 20 millimetres 0.79in of rain may fall in a few minutes the results of cloudbursts can be disastrous cloudbursts are also responsible for flash flood creationrapid precipitation from cumulonimbus clouds is possible due to the langmuir precipitation process in which large droplets can grow rapidly by coagulating with smaller droplets which fall down slowly it is not essential that cloudbursts occur only when a cloud clashes with a solid body like a mountain they can also occur when hot water vapor mingles into the cold resulting in sudden condensationin the indian subcontinent a cloudburst usually occurs when a monsoon cloud drifts northwards from the bay of bengal or arabian sea across the plains then onto the himalaya and bursts bringing rainfall as high as 75 millimeters per houron july 20  2017 a cloudburst caused huge damage at thathri town of doda district killing more than 6 people
