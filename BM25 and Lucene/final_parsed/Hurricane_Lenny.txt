hurricane lenny  wikipedia hurricane lenny was the twelfth tropical storm eighth hurricane and record-breaking fifth category 4hurricane in the 1999 atlantic hurricane season it is the second-strongest november atlantic hurricane on record behind the 1932 cuba hurricane lenny formed on november13 in the western caribbean sea and maintained an unprecedented west-to-east track for its entire duration it attained hurricane status south of jamaica on november 15 and passed south of hispaniola and puerto rico over the next few days lenny rapidly intensified over the northeastern caribbean on november17 attaining peak winds of 155mph 249kmh about 21mi 34km south of saint croix in the united states virgin islands it gradually weakened while moving through the leeward islands eventually dissipating on november23 over the open atlantic oceanbefore moving through the lesser antilles lenny produced rough surf that killed two people in northern colombia strong winds and rainfall resulted in heavy crop damage in southeastern puerto rico despite the hurricanes passage near saint croix at peak intensity damage on the small island was only described as moderate although there was widespread flooding and erosion damage in the united states territories totaled about 330million the highest precipitation total was 34.12in 867mm at the police station on the french side of saint martin on the island the hurricane killed three people and destroyed more than 200properties in nearby antigua and barbuda the hurricane killed one person torrential rainfall there contaminated the local water supply significant storm damage occurred as far south as grenada where high surf isolated towns from the capital cityhurricane lenny began as a low-pressure area that was first observed in the southwestern caribbean sea on november8 it developed an area of convection but remained poorly defined for the next few days thunderstorms spread across the region producing heavy rainfall in portions of mexico and central america on november13 the system became better organized a hurricane hunters flight later that day discovered a surface circulation and winds of about 35mph 56kmh the data indicated the development of tropical depression sixteen at 1800utc about 175mi 282km south of the cayman islands the depressions convection was fairly disorganized and the national hurricane center nhc did not anticipate any strengthening for three days for much of its existence the tropical cyclone maintained a track from west to east across the caribbean sea which was unprecedented in the atlantic hurricane database earning it the nickname left-hand lenny the path resulted from its movement along the southern end of a trough over the western atlantic oceanafter its formation the depression gradually became better organized the nhc upgraded it to tropical storm lenny on november14 based on reports from the hurricane hunters when it was first upgraded to a tropical storm the cyclone already had winds of 65mph 105kmh and a developing eye feature at 0000utc on november15 lenny attained hurricane status about 175mi 282km southwest of kingston jamaica the quick intensification was unexpected and occurred after a large area of convection blossomed over the center at the same time lenny developed an anticyclone aloft which provided favorable conditions for the hurricanes development after moving east-southeastward during its initial development stages the hurricane turned more to the east on november15 the hurricane hunters reported winds of 100mph 160kmh which indicated that lenny had become a category2 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale however the cloud pattern subsequently became less organized as the eye disappeared and lennys winds weakened to 85mph 137kmh while the hurricane passed south of hispaniola the nhc noted the deterioration could have been due to a disruption of the storms small inner core by subtle environmental changes after the sudden weakening the hurricane hunters reported that the eye had reformed and the hurricanes winds had reached 100mph 160kmh at the time a ridge was expected to build to lennys east and turn the storm northeastward into puerto rico 24hours laterbeginning on november16 hurricane lenny underwent a 24-hour period of rapid deepening reaching major hurricane status about 165mi 266km south of the mona passage it developed well-defined banding features good outflow and a circular eye that was visible from the radar in san juan puerto rico the hurricane continued to become better organized with an eye 29mi 47km in diameter surrounded by a closed eyewall around 1200utc on november17 lenny intensified into a category4 hurricane while approaching the islands of the northeastern caribbean it was the fifth storm of such intensity in the year setting the record for most category4 hurricanes in a season the hurricane then made its closest approach to puerto rico passing about 75mi 121km southeast of maunabo shortly thereafter lenny attained peak winds of 155mph 249kmh while passing 21mi 34km south of the island of saint croix in the united states virgin islands this made it the second-strongest hurricane on record to form during the month of november hurricane hunters reported lennys peak winds in the southeastern portion of the hurricane the group also reported a minimum pressure of 933mbar a drop of 34mbar in 24hours in addition a dropsonde recorded winds of 210mph 340kmh while descending to the surface the highest dropsonde wind speed recording in a hurricane at the timearound the time it peaked in intensity lennys forward speed decreased in response to light steering currents between two ridges despite favorable conditions for strengthening the hurricane weakened as it turned to an eastward drift possibly due to the upwelling of cooler waters late on november18 lennys eye moved over saint martin with winds of 125mph 201kmh after continued weakening the hurricane struck anguilla and saint barthlemy the next day it turned southeastward while still drifting bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the islands across the northeastern caribbean late on november19 lenny weakened to tropical storm intensity after increased wind shear exposed the cyclones center from the deepest convection early on november20 the storm made landfall on anguilla although by then the center had become difficult to locate later that day the cyclone exited the caribbean continuing its southeast track on november21 lenny turned to the northeast and weakened to a tropical depression the deep convection was located at least 100mi 160km east of the increasingly elongated center lenny turned to the east for the final time early on november22 dissipating the next day about 690mi 1,110km east of the lesser antillesearly in lennys duration a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were issued for jamaica later a hurricane watch was issued for the southern coast of hispaniola and a tropical storm warning was also issued for the dominican republic haitian officials declared a state of alert in three southern provinces and allocated about 1million 1999usd in hurricane funds residents in flood-prone areas were advised to evacuate in southern haiti and in the neighboring dominican republica hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico and the virgin islands late on november15 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning six hours later by that time lenny was projected to move over puerto rico after lenny made its closest approach to the island the hurricane warning was downgraded to a tropical storm warning on november17 which was discontinued the following day along with the advisories in the virgin islands in puerto rico the media

was little warning for the hurricane in grenada and most people left their boats in the wateracross the eastern caribbean hurricane lenny damaged vital infrastructure including roads and piers in the tourism-dependent islands most of the islands tourism areas were on western-facing beaches many of which were unprepared for the high waves and winds produced by lennyearly in its existence lenny produced large waves and high tides along the guajira peninsula in colombia sinking two boats and flooding 1,200houses there were also reports of flooded businesses and damaged crops in the country strong winds on the storms fringe killed a man by striking him with a beam although there were initial reports of nine people missing only two were counted in the death toll for mainland colombia two sailors were killed offshore when their yacht was lost in the southern caribbean seaalong the abc islands off the north coast of venezuela the hurricane produced 10-to-20ft 3-to-6m waves along the southwest coastlines the waves caused heavy beach erosion and coastal damage to properties and boatsin jamaica the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall but left little damage rains in the dominican republic caused flooding in the countrys southwest portion flooding around les cayes in southwestern haiti destroyed 60percent of the rice corn and banana plantations while high waves wrecked several houses in cavaellonhurricane lenny was originally forecast to strike puerto rico although it remained south of the island beginning on november17 lenny affected puerto rico with gusty winds and heavy rainfall rainfall in the days prior to lennys approach left areas susceptible to flooding which caused many rivers in the northeastern portion of the island to overflow their banks following the storm such flooding forced towns to evacuate along the rivers and also resulted in the closure of secondary and primary highways the heavy rains also caused mudslides and rockslides the peak rainfall on the island was 14.64in 372mm in jayuya in central puerto rico tides in san juan were about 1.8ft 0.55m above normal there high seas washed a 546ft 166m freighter ashore winds in the puerto rican mainland

roof of an apartment property damage in the british virgin islands totaled 5.6million 1999usd however the damage combined with the loss of tourism and productivity yielded a loss of 22million to the islands economy or 3.1percent of the gross domestic productthe eye of lenny moved over anguilla an island located east of the british virgin islands localized flooding was reported including in the capital the valley where waters reportedly reached a depth of 14ft 4.3m the hurricane struck only a month after hurricane jose had affected the region causing significant beach erosion along anguillas coastline damage from lenny amounted to 65.8millionsaint barthlemy and the sss islands which include saba sint eustatius and saint martin were in the path of hurricane lenny on november18 through 19
