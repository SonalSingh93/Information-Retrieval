began around 1884 when african-americans from the panhandle of florida purchased land a little inland from the orange grove house of refuge and began farming by 1894 the black community was large enough to establish the first school in the areain 1894 william s linton a republican us congressman for saginaw michigan bought a tract of land just west of the orange grove house of refuge and began selling plots in what he hoped would become a farming community initially this community was named after linton in 1896 henry flagler extended his florida east coast railroad south from west palm beach to miami with a station at lintonthe linton settlers began to achieve success with truck farming of winter vegetables for the northern market a hard freeze in 1898 was a setback and many of the settlers left including william linton partly in an attempt to change the communitys luck or to leave behind a bad reputation the settlements name was changed in 1901 to delray after the detroit neighborhood of delray delray being the anglicized spelling of del rey which is spanish for of the king which in turn was named after the mexican-american wars battle of molino del reysettlers from
