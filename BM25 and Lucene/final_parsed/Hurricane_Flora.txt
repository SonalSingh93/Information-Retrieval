hurricane flora  wikipedia hurricane flora is among the deadliest atlantic hurricanes in recorded history with a death total of at least 7,186 the seventh tropical storm and sixth hurricane of the 1963 atlantic hurricane season flora developed from a disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone on september 26 while located 755 miles 1,215km southwest of the cape verde islands after remaining a weak depression for several days it rapidly organized on september 29 to attain tropical storm status flora continued to quickly strengthen to reach category 3 hurricane status before moving through the windward islands and passing over tobago and it reached maximum sustained winds of 145 miles per hour 233kmh in the caribbeanthe storm struck southwestern haiti near peak intensity turned to the west and drifted over cuba for four days before turning to the northeast flora passed over the bahamas and accelerated northeastward becoming an extratropical cyclone on october 12 due to its slow movement across cuba flora is the wettest known tropical cyclone for cuba haiti and the dominican republic the significant casualties caused by flora were the most for a tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin since the 1900 galveston hurricanea disturbance in the intertropical convergence zone organized into a tropical depression on september 26 while located about 755 miles 1,215km southwest of the island of fogo in the cape verde islands upon forming the depression had a poorly organized circulation with banding features to its north and east the depression moved west-northwestward and the system failed to organize significantly by a day after developing on september 27 the banding features dissipated though the area of convection around the center increased satellite imagery was unavailable until september 30 during which there were not sufficient ship reports to indicate the presence of a low-level circulation the depression continued west-northwestward and it is estimated it intensified into tropical storm flora on september 29 while located about 560 miles 900km east-southeast of trinidad or about 350 miles 560km north of cayenne french guiana operationally advisories were not initiated until a day laterflora quickly intensified after it became a tropical storm and early on september 30 it attained hurricane status later that day reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the existence of the hurricane with the flight reporting a well-defined circular 8-mile 13km wide eye one observer noted flora to be the best organized tropical cyclone over the previous two years after attaining major hurricane status flora passed directly over the island of tobago late on the 30th with winds of 120mph 190kmh the hurricane continued west-northwestward as it entered the caribbean and early on october 2 its winds reached 140 miles per hour 230kmh thirty hours later flora intensified slightly further and attained peak winds of 145mph 233kmh while located about 105 miles 169km south of the border of haiti and the dominican republicafter turning to the northwest hurricane flora maintained its peak strength and made landfall in sud haiti late on october 3 as a 145mph 233kmh category4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale with gusts from 180 to 200 miles per hour 290 to 320kmh the calm of the eye lasted for up to 70minutes in one location after quickly weakening to a 120mph 190kmh hurricane flora turned more to the west in the windward passage and restrengthened slightly to strike southeastern cuba about 30 miles 48km east of guantanamo bay with winds of 125mph 201kmh a high pressure system to its north turned the motion of the hurricane to a westward drift causing it to weaken quickly over land flora neared the north coast of cuba on october 4 before turning to the south it executed a cyclonic loop and entered the coastal waters off granma province an anticyclone to the west of flora turned the hurricane to the north bringing it ashore near santa cruz del sur on october 7 with winds of around 90mph 140kmh flora initially turned southeastward over central cuba and late on october 8 a short-wave trough turned the hurricane northeastward bringing it into the coastal waters of the holgun province flora remained a hurricane while drifting over land due to abundant moisture and a favorable upper level environmentafter passing over the southeastern bahamas early on october 9 flora began to restrengthen and on october 10 it again reached major hurricane status while located 290 miles 470km south of bermuda the hurricane gradually weakened as it continued northeastward and weakened to a category1 hurricane on october 11 flora gradually lost its convection over the north atlantic ocean and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on october 12 while located 270 miles 430km east-southeast of cape race newfoundland the extratropical remnant dissipated the next daythe weather bureau in san juan puerto rico issued a hurricane warning for trinidad tobago and the grenadines south of saint vincent in the cyclones first advisory on hurricane flora gale warnings were later issued for islands off northern venezuela and from saint vincent northward to martinique advisories on flora emphasized the danger of the hurricane and advised preparations to be rushed to completion the advisories also recommended small craft throughout the windward islands to remain at harbor and for shipping in the path of the hurricane to advise extreme caution people in low-lying areas and near beaches were advised to evacuate to higher grounds as well lead time was short especially in tobago which received news of the approaching hurricane just two hours before it struckon october 2 two days before it made landfall on southwestern hispaniola the san juan weather bureau issued a gale warning from barahona in the dominican republic to sud-est haiti advisories recommended small craft in the southern portions of the countries to remain at port later that day the gale warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning in southwestern haiti on the day of when flora made landfall advisories recommended all citizens on beaches and in low-lying areas west of santo domingo to evacuate carmelo di franco the provisional director of civic defense for the dominican republic organized safety procedures and the dissemination of tropical cyclone bulletins from the san juan weather bureau di franco also organized for the transmission of hurricane emergency information to citizens believed to reduce the loss of life on the afternoon before the hurricane struck the head of the haitian red cross prohibited radio broadcasts of tropical cyclone advisories for fear of panic among citizens as a result many thought the hurricane would miss the countryofficials at the cuban national observatory issued radio bulletins on the hurricane which included the position of flora its intensity direction of motion and necessary warnings by the time the hurricane left the island more than 40,000 had been evacuated to safer areasthe weather bureau predicted flora to turn to the northwest after entering the windward passage and affect the bahamas forecasters advised those in the bahamas to quickly complete preparations though the eye of the hurricane did not pass over the archipelago until four days later when flora turned to the northeast out to sea forecasters again advised bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane and on october 9 weather advisories advised the southeastern bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides one advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern florida though weather bulletins advised florida citizens to monitor the hurricane at its closest approach to florida the hurricane remained 330miles 530km away though gale warnings were issued from stuart to key west due to the hurricanes large sizethroughout its path hurricane flora resulted in more than 7,000 deaths and over 525million in damage 1963usd 4.11billion 2017usd it is estimated that if a hurricane like flora had struck in 1998 it would have caused over 12,000 casualtieshurricane flora passed barbados a few days after hurricane edith moved through the area the two hurricanes resulted in about 65,000 in damage 1963usd primarily to fishing interestsabout four hours before the eye of hurricane flora moved over tobago the large hurricane began producing heavy rainfall throughout the island two hours later strong winds began affecting the island and while moving across the island flora produced winds of up to 100 miles per hour 160kmh while moving past tobago the hurricane produced rough surf and tides 5 to 7 feet 1.5 to 2.1m above normal the hurricane sunk six ships between 4 and 9 tons in scarborough harbour one crew member drowned while attempting to save his vessel heavy rainfall caused a large mudslide from mount dillon onto a road leading to castara this was considered the most well-known mudslide on the island the strong winds caused severe damage to coconut banana and cocoa plantations with 50% of the coconut trees being destroyed and another 11% being severely damaged 75% of forest trees fell and most of the remaining were greatly damaged the passage of hurricane flora destroyed 2,750 of tobagos 7,500 houses and damaged 3,500 others the hurricane killed 18 on the island and resulted in 30million in crop and property damage 1963usdwinds on trinidad reached 55mph 89kmh with much higher gusts of over 70mph 110kmh heavy rainfall and strong winds in the northern mountainous region lowered the visibility to zero due to the mountain range on its northern coast damage on the island was minimal totaling to 100,000 1963usd two people on the island died due to drowning when flora passed the island and the winds turned to the southwest many small boats in the westward facing harbor were sunk near chaguaramas nine boats were destroyed and eight were damaged additionally several large vessels sustained damage and resulted in them being intentionally sunk damage in grenada was minor around 25,000 1963usd though six people died due to drowning rough seas and higher than normal tides were reported along the south coast of puerto rico though no damage or deaths were reported thereflora produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds in the dominican republic the highest rainfall amount reported was 39.43 inches 1,002mm at polo barahona flooding from the hurricane considered to be the most extensive on record greatly damaged bridges and roads with many roads left unpassable for several months after the hurricane struck over 3,800 sq miles 10,000km in the western portion of the country were flooded the hurricane caused about 60million in damage 1963usd and over 400 deathswhile moving across southwestern haiti hurricane flora produced winds of up to 120mph 190kmh near derez while the capital city of port-au-prince reported peak winds of 65mph 105kmh intense rainbands dropped torrential precipitation estimated at over 75 inches 1,900mm in miragone with one location recording over 57 inches 1,400mm in three days one location in the southwestern peninsula recorded 16 inches 410mm of precipitation in 12 hours the storm surge on the southern coast is unknown but estimated to exceed 12 feet 3.7m flash floods from the hurricane washed out large sections of several towns while mudslides buried some entire towns resulting in many deaths heavy rainfall led to river flooding along the grise river which crested at 14 feet 4.3m above normal the flood waters created new channels and washed away entire banana plantationsstrong winds in southwestern haiti from the hurricane damaged or destroyed hundreds of trees the path of flora over the area was best determined by the trajectory of fallen trees across the peninsula the strong winds left entire villages roofless with many buildings entirely destroyed the combination of rough waves and strong winds destroyed three entire communities many of those who died in southwestern haiti suffered from intense burns from strong winds in most areas crops were entirely destroyed the coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years additionally strong winds downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula one official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrownabout 3,500 people were confirmed dead with several thousands missing at one report five months after the hurricane it is estimated the passage of hurricane flora killed around 5,000 people and caused between 125million and 180million in damage in haiti 1963usdstrong northerly winds from flora eroded the northern beaches in the cuban province of camagey by up to 1 kilometre 3,300ft santa cruz del sur reported strong southerly winds and rough seas winds in cuba reached 125 miles per hour 201kmh nearly all crops in southeastern cuba were affected by strong winds and flooding many citizens were left stranded at the tops of their houses several entire houses were swept away by the flooding and many roads and bridges were destroyed resulting in major disruptions to communications isolated locations in cuba received over 80 inches 2,000mm of rain with santiago de cuba recording 100.39 inches 2,550mm which is the highest rainfall total measured on cuba from any rainfall event on recordheavy rainfall fell across the island of jamaica due to southwest flow into the mountains on floras southern periphery over several days the maximum amount recorded was 60 inches 1,500mm at spring hill persistent which led to numerous landslides across the eastern portion of the island damage to the island totaled 11.9million 1963 dollars rough seas from flora affected the bahamas and the southeastern florida coast on october 5 as the hurricane stalled over cuba keeping small craft in port and hurricane-force winds affected ragged island later that day rainfall amounts peaked at 17.19 inches 437mm at duncan town in the bahamas damage to the island archipelago reached 1.5million 1963 dollarsin tobago the great agricultural damage from flora caused the crop plantations to be abandoned as a result the economy of the island changed towards tourism the destruction of the tobagonian rainforests resulted in a continual decline of agriculture on the island due to animals previously in the forest eating the crops for food the passage of the hurricane reduced the height of the rainforest canopy above 800 feet 240m by half twenty-five years passed before the canopy reached its previous heightin the dominican republic damage reports were largely unknown by a month after the hurricane passed the island primarily in the western provinces there roads were still impassable large areas remained without electricity and helicopters could not land in remote areas due to mud silt and up to 3 feet 0.91m of water in all landing fields one official estimated several months would pass before survey teams could obtain information on loss of life and overall damagesdue to its impact on the caribbean nations the name flora was retired after this year and was replaced by fern
