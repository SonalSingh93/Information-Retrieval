tropical storm marco  2008   wikipedia tropical storm marco was the smallest tropical cyclone on record the thirteenth named storm of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season marco developed out of a broad area of low pressure over the northwestern caribbean during late september 2008 influenced by a tropical wave on october4 a small low-level circulation center developed over belize after crossing the southern end of the yucatn peninsula and emerging into the bay of campeche the low was declared tropical depression thirteen early on october6 the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name marco later that day marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65mph 100kmh early on october7 around this time tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles 18.5km from the center of the storm making marco the smallest tropical cyclone on record around 1200utc marco made landfall near misantla veracruz the storm rapidly weakened after landfall dissipating later that day due to its small size marco caused minimal damage however the storms heavy rains led to floods up to 10 feet 3.05m deep that covered highways and damaged homestropical storm marco originated in a broad area of low pressure that persisted over the northwestern caribbean in late september 2008 on october4 a tropical wave reached the same area and the system spawned a circulation center over belize development of the low was initially inhibited by its proximity to land as the system neared the bay of campeche convection quickly developed around the low at 0000utc on october6 the low was designated as tropical depression thirteen while located over laguna de trminos a mid-level ridge located to the north of the depression led to movement in a general west-northwest direction forecasters anticipated intensification up until landfall because of the storms well-developed outflow and the low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures in its path by 1200utc the small cyclone with a cloud shield no more than 85 miles 137 kilometers across was upgraded to tropical storm marcofavorable conditions for development allowed marco to quickly intensify throughout the day on october6 early on october7 marco reached its peak intensity with winds of 65mph 105kmh and a minimum pressure of 998millibar hpa 29.47inhg this was based on a reconnaissance mission into marco which recorded flight-level winds of 70mph 110kmh corresponding to a surface wind speed of 61mph 98kmh following the quick increase in intensity forecasters noted the possibility of marco intensifying into a hurricane before making landfall the storm maintained a small area of deep convection averaging 9.2 miles 14.8km in diameter as it continued moving towards the west-northwest shortly after reaching peak intensity tropical storm force winds extended 11.5 miles 18.5km from the center of marco at 1200utc the center of marco made landfall near misantla veracruz with winds of 65mph 105kmh once inland marco rapidly weakened being downgraded to a tropical depression six hours after landfall the small depression dissipated later that day over the mountains of mexicoupon the storms formation the

near veracruz as people evacuated to higher ground the rains from marco worsened flood situations in areas of mexico already suffering from severe flooding officials in veracruz in their post-storm damage survey reported that two rivers the quilate and tenoch overflowed their banks due to rains produced by marco one of these rivers left the towns of minatitlan and hidalgotitlan under 10ft 3m of
