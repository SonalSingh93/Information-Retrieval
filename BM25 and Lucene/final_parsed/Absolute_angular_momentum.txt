absolute angular momentum  wikipedia in meteorology absolute angular momentum refers to the angular momentum in an absolute coordinate system absolute time and spaceangular momentum  equates with the cross product of the position vector  of a particle or fluid parcel and its absolute linear momentum  equal to  the product of mass and velocity mathematicallyabsolute angular momentum sums the angular momentum of a particle or fluid parcel in a relative coordinate system and the angular momentum of that relative coordinate systemmeteorologists typically express the three vector components of velocity  eastward northward and upward the magnitude of the absolute angular momentum  per unit mass wherethe first term represents the angular momentum of the parcel with respect to the surface of the earth which depends strongly on weather the second term represents the angular momentum of the earth itself at a particular latitude essentially constant at least on non-geological timescalesin the shallow troposphere of the earth one can approximate  the distance between the fluid parcel and the center of the earth approximately equal to the mean earth radiuswhereat the north pole and south pole latitude  no absolute angular momentum can exist  because  if a fluid parcel with no eastward wind speed  originating at the equator  so  conserves its angular momentum  as it moves poleward then its eastward wind speed increases dramatically  after those substitutions  or after further simplification  solution for  gives  if   then the zonal pressure gradient and eddy stresses cause torque that changes the absolute angular momentum of fluid parcelsholton james r hakim gregory j 2012 an introduction to dynamic meteorology 5 waltham massachusetts academic press pp342343 isbn978-0-12-384866-6
