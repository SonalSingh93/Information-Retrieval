1932 cuba hurricane  wikipedia the 1932 cuba hurricane known also as the hurricane of santa cruz del sur or the 1932 camagey hurricane was the deadliest and one of the most intense tropical cyclones in cuban history the only category 5 atlantic hurricane ever recorded in november the cyclone had a path through the caribbean sea atypical to most hurricanes developing late in the atlantic hurricane season the storms strong winds storm surge and rain devastated an extensive portion of central and eastern cuba where the storm was considered the worst natural disaster of the 20th century though the effects from the hurricane were concentrated primarily on cuba significant effects were also felt in the cayman islands and the bahamas with lesser effects felt elsewherethe tropical depression that would later develop into the destructive hurricane was first located east of the lesser antilles on october30 and tracked westward into the caribbean sea reaching tropical storm strength the next day moving southwestward towards the southern portion of the caribbean the storm reached hurricane strength on november2 before a period of rapid intensification ensued on november6 the tropical cyclone reached its peak intensity as a category5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 175mph 280kmh the storm weakened to category4 intensity while recurving northeast moving ashore cubas camagey province on november9 with winds of 150mph 240kmh after traversing the island the storm gradually weakened as it crossed the central bahamas islands and near bermuda on november13 the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and dissipated the next dayas an intensifying hurricane in the southern caribbean sea the storm moved near the netherlands antilles and colombia causing widespread effects a prolonged passage of curacao resulted in the damaging of the harbor fortification the storm lashed the coast of colombia with strong winds and torrential rainfall severely hampering the banana crop in the region and disrupting telecommunications several towns particularly those near the coast sustained significant infrastructural damage marked albeit localized damage to banana crops was also reported in jamaica where strong winds toppled numerous trees in open waters the storms track brought it across numerous shipping lanes largely disrupting shipping primarily in the central caribbean and damaging several shipsthe 1932cuba hurricane can be traced back to a tropical depression first identified at 06:00utc on october30 by ship observations roughly 200mi 320km east of guadeloupe tracking generally westward the depression crossed the lesser antilles the next day between dominica and martinique barometric pressures decrease to as much as 1008mbar hpa 29.77inhg in st lucia confirmed the presence of a developing tropical cyclone shortly after traversing the islands the disturbance strengthened to tropical storm intensity at 18:00utc on october31 concurrently as the storm was gradually intensifying the tropical cyclone began to take an unusual course towards the southwest on november2 the storm intensified to hurricane status while north of the netherlands antillessteadily strengthening the hurricane reached category2 status on november3 during the day the storm passed approximately 50mi 80km north of punta gallinas in colombia the northernmost extent of south america however at the same time the hurricane curved towards the west causing the storm to move away from colombia and venezuela during the next few days the hurricane rapidly intensified reaching major hurricane status late on november4 the next day the hurricanes intensity was analyzed to have been the equivalent of a modern-day category5 hurricane while curving northward although the storm was analyzed operationally to have maximized as a category4 hurricane reanalysis of the hurricane indicated that the tropical cyclone was much more intense than suggested initially based on observations by the ss phemius the crew of which visually estimated winds of around 200mph 320kmh at the maximum of the storm and measured unusually low pressures early on november6 the hurricane peaked with maximum sustained winds estimated at 175mph 280kmh during that time the ss phemius recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 915mbar hpa 27.02inhg this measurement was the lowest documented throughout the storms existence as this report did not occur within the hurricanes eye the storms true minimum pressure may have been much lesspacing northward the hurricane gradually weakened after maximum intensity on november6 but held its category5 strength for 72consecutive hours before finally dropping to category4 status due to a gradual curve towards the northeast the hurricane tracked near cayman brac on november9 a minimum barometric pressure of 939mbar hpa 27.73inhg was documented on the island only slight weakening occurred before the hurricane made landfall on the caribbean coast of cubas camagey province at 14:00utc that day at the time of landfall the tropical cyclone was estimated to have had a minimum pressure of 918mbar hpa 27.11inhg and maximum sustained winds of 150mph 240kmh with these winds extending as far as 40mi 65km from the center of the hurricane the storm traversed cuba in six hours before emerging into the atlantic ocean late on november9 after which it began to cross the central bahamian archipelago at 07:00utc on november10 the hurricane made a second landfall on long island bahamas with an intensity equivalent to that of a modern-day category3 continuing to track northeast the storm moved east of bermuda two days later on november13 the hurricane began to interact with an extratropical cyclone centered over the canadian maritimes and later weakened to tropical storm strength the tropical cyclone later became extratropical itself before it was last noted at 18:00utc on november14as the hurricane moved slowly through the eastern and southern caribbean the rough seas and strong winds disrupted shipping routes on november6 the american schooner abundance encountered the storm east of jamaica resulting in a destroyed rudder and a beaching on jamaicas morant point however the ships six crew were extracted from the disabled vessel and were transported to the united states although the ss phemius would later return safely to port in cuba reports that the ship had lost its smokestack and the relaying of an sos message prompted the united fruit company liner tela to search for the initially missing ship which failed due to poor visibility conditions this was followed by a search operation undertaken by the uss overton dd-239 and uss swan am-34 on november8 the ss phemius was found damaged and later towed to shore by a salvage tug however during the same period of time both the steamer tacira and the freighter san simeon were disabled after encountering the storm requiring towing to safety several other ships in the immediate area were also hampered by the stormsome damage was reported in northern south america as the hurricane swept near the coast in colombia rail telecommunications were interrupted near santa marta and banana plantations in the area were believed to have suffered to some extent due to the storms winds and rain in santa marta itself several homes were inundated and automotive traffic was hampered by the storms effects docks on santa martas port were also damaged heavy rains also washed out some railways and bridges further disrupting the distribution of banana shipments elsewhere along the coast many of colombias seaports were damaged by the storms effects while inland farms suffered extensive flood damage due to sparse reports from the remainder of colombia the extent of damage in barranquilla remains unspecified with other nearby towns reporting heavy damage the village of sevilla valle del cauca was almost entirely destroyed providencia island just off of colombia sustained significant agricultural damage and the loss of 36homes to the northeast in curacao the passing hurricane destroyed the island harbors fortifications a seawall near the entrance to sint anna harbor suffered partial collapse while a pontoon bridge linking both sides of the harbor was completely destroyed in nearby bonaire a pier succumbed to the driving rain and rough seaswith the hurricane threatening jamaica pan american world airways cancelled its flights servicing kingston jamaica in jamaica the storms passage to the west caused intense winds as strong as 71mph 114kmh to sweep across the island destroying over 2million trees although effects overall were generally minimal some localized areas on the island experienced as much as a 50%loss of banana trees due to the storm the cost of damage on jamaica was us4millionthe storm devastated the cayman islands especially cayman brac which was inundated by the storm surge which was reported to be as high as 10m 33ft many homes and buildings were washed out to sea as a result of the storm and many people had to climb trees to escape the floodwaters 110people died on the islands one of them was on grand cayman and the rest were on cayman brac the ship balboa also sank as a result of the stormalthough no warnings were issued initially the national observatory of cuba voiced concerns that the intense tropical cyclone presented a danger to cuba particularly camagey province as early as november5 however the observatory indicated that forecasting the future motion of the hurricane was difficult as the storms intensity and previous motion was not consistent with climatology on november8 a hurricane warning was issued for the southeastern extent of cuba as a precautionary measure shipping routes servicing ports in eastern cuba were suspendedthe town of santa cruz del sur in camagey province was virtually obliterated by a massive storm surge which measured 6.5m 21.3ft in height few buildings remained standing in the area in that coastal town alone a total of 2,870people lost their lives in total 3,033people died in cuba and damage there was estimated at 40million 1932 usd 702.1 million today
