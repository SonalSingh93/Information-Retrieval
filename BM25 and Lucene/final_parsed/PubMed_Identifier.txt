pubmed  wikipedia pubmed is a free search engine accessing primarily the medline database of references and abstracts on life sciences and biomedical topics the united states national library of medicine nlm at the national institutes of health maintains the database as part of the entrez system of information retrievalfrom 1971 to 1997 medline online access to the medlars online computerized database primarily had been through institutional facilities such as university libraries pubmed first released in january 1996 ushered in the era of private free home- and office-based medline searching the pubmed system was offered free to the public in june 1997 when medline searches via the web were demonstrated in a ceremony by vice president al gorein addition to medline pubmed provides access tomany pubmed records contain links to full text articles some of which are freely available often in pubmed central and local mirrors such as uk pubmed centralinformation about the journals indexed in medline and available through pubmed is found in the nlm catalogas of 11 july 2017 pubmed has more than 27.3 million records going back to 1966 selectively to the year 1865 and very selectively to 1809 about 500,000 new records are added each year as of the same date 13.1 million of pubmeds records are listed with their abstracts and 14.2 million articles have links to full-text of which 3.8 million articles are available full-text for free for any user approximately 12% of the records in pubmed correspond to cancer-related entries which have grown from 6% in the 1950s to 16% in 2016 other significant proportion of records correspond to chemistry 8.69% therapy 8.39% and infection 5%in 2016 nlm changed the indexing system so that publishers will be able to directly correct typos and errors in pubmed indexed articlessimple searches on pubmed can be carried out by entering key aspects of a subject into pubmeds search windowpubmed translates this initial search formulation and automatically adds field names relevant mesh medical subject headings terms synonyms boolean operators and nests the resulting terms appropriately enhancing the search formulation significantly in particular by routinely combining using the or operator textwords and mesh termsthe examples given in a pubmed tutorial demonstrate how this automatic process workslikewisea new pubmed interface was launched in october 2009 and encouraged the use of such quick google-like search formulations they have also been described as telegram searches by default the results are sorted by most recent but this changed to best match publication date first author last author journal or titlefor optimal searches in pubmed it is necessary to understand its core component medline and especially of the mesh medical subject headings controlled vocabulary used to index medline articles they may also require complex search strategies use of field names tags proper use of limits and other features reference librarians and search specialists offer search serviceswhen a journal article is indexed numerous article parameters are extracted and stored as structured information such parameters are article type mesh terms eg clinical trial secondary identifiers mesh terms language country of the journal or publication history e-publication date print journal publication datepublication type parameter allows searching by the type of publication including reports of various kinds of clinical researchsince july 2005 the medline article indexing process extracts identifiers from the article abstract and puts those in a field called secondary identifier si the secondary identifier field is to store accession numbers to various databases of molecular sequence data gene expression or chemical compounds and clinical trial ids for clinical trials pubmed extracts trial ids for the two largest trial registries clinicaltrialsgov nct identifier and the international standard randomized controlled trial number register irctn identifiera reference which is judged particularly relevant can be marked and related articles can be identified if relevant several studies can be selected and related articles to all of them can be generated on pubmed or any of the other ncbi entrez databases using the find related data option the related articles are then listed in order of relatedness to create these lists of related articles pubmed compares words from the title and abstract of each citation as well as the mesh headings assigned using a powerful word-weighted algorithm the related articles function has been judged to be so precise that the authors of a paper suggested it can be used instead of a full searchpubmed automatically links to mesh terms and subheadings examples would be bad breath links to and includes in the search halitosis heart attack to myocardial infarction breast cancer to breast neoplasms where appropriate these mesh terms are automatically expanded that is include more specific terms terms like nursing are automatically linked to nursing mesh or nursing subheading this feature is called auto term mapping and is enacted by default in free text searching but not exact phrase searching ie enclosing the search query with double quotes this feature makes pubmed searches more sensitive and avoids false-negative missed hits by compensating for the diversity of medical terminologythe pubmed optional facility my ncbi with free registration provides tools forand a wide range of other options the my ncbi area can be accessed from any computer with web-access an earlier version of my ncbi was called pubmed cubbylinkout a nlm facility to link and make available full-text local journal holdings some 3,200 sites mainly academic institutions participate in this nlm facility as of march 2010 from aalborg university in denmark to zymogenetics in seattle users at these institutions see their institutions logo within the pubmed search result if the journal is held at that institution and can access the full-textin 2016 pubmed allows authors of articles to comment on articles indexed by pubmed this feature was initially tested in a pilot mode since 2013 and was made permanent in 2016pubmedmedline can be accessed via handheld devices using for instance the pico option for focused clinical questions created by the nlm a pubmed mobile option providing access to a mobile friendly simplified pubmed version is also availableaskmedline a free-text natural language query tool for medlinepubmed developed by the nlm also suitable for handheldsa pmid pubmed identifier or pubmed unique identifier is a unique integer value starting at 1 assigned to each pubmed record a pmid is not the same as a pmcid which is the identifier for all works published in the free-to-access pubmed centralthe assignment of a pmid or pmcid to a publication tells the reader nothing about the type or quality of the content pmids are assigned to letters to the editor editorial opinions op-ed columns and any other piece that the editor chooses to include in the journal as well as peer-reviewed papers the existence of the identification number is also not proof that the papers have not been retracted for fraud incompetence or misconduct the announcement about any corrections to original papers may be assigned a pmidthe national library of medicine leases the medline information to a number of private vendors such as embase ovid dialog ebsco knowledge finder and many other commercial non-commercial and academic providers as of october 2008 more than 500 licenses had been issued more than 200 of them to providers outside the united states as licenses to use medline data are available for free the nlm in effect provides a free testing ground for a wide range of alternative interfaces and 3rd party additions to pubmed one of a very few large professionally curated databases which offers this optionlu identifies a sample of 28 current and free web-based pubmed versions requiring no installation or registration which are grouped into four categoriesas most of these and other alternatives rely essentially on pubmedmedline data leased under license from the nlmpubmed the term pubmed derivatives has been suggested without the need to store about 90gb of original pubmed datasets anybody can write pubmed applications using the eutils-application program interface as described in the e-utilities in-depth parameters syntax and more by eric sayers phdalternative methods to mine the data in pubmed use programming environments such as matlab python or r in these cases queries of pubmed are written as lines of code and passed to pubmed and the response is then processed directly in the programming environment code can be automated to systematically queries with different keywords such as disease year organs etc a recent publication 2017 found that the proportion of cancer-related entries in pubmed has rise from 6% in the 1950s to 16% in 2016
