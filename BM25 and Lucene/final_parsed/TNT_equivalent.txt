tnt equivalent  wikipedia tnt equivalent is a convention for expressing energy typically used to describe the energy released in an explosion the ton of tnt is a unit of energy defined by that convention to be 4.184 gigajoules which is the approximate energy released in the detonation of a metric ton 1,000 kilograms or one megagram of tnt the convention intends to compare the destructiveness of an event with that of conventional explosive materials of which tnt is a typical example although other conventional explosives such as dynamite contain more energythe kiloton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 terajoulesthe megaton of tnt is a unit of energy equal to 4.184 petajoulesthe kiloton and megaton of tnt have traditionally been used to describe the energy output and hence the destructive power of a nuclear weapon the tnt equivalent appears in various nuclear weapon control treaties and has been used to characterize the energy released in such other highly destructive events as an asteroid impacta gram of tnt releases 26736702j joules upon explosion the energy liberated by one gram of tnt was arbitrarily defined as a matter of convention to be 4184j which is exactly one kilocaloriean explosives energy is normally expressed as the thermodynamic work produced by its detonation which for tnt has been accurately measured as 4686jg from a large sample of air blast experiments and theoretically calculated to be 4853jgthe measured pure heat output of a gram of tnt is only 2724j but this is not the important value for explosive blast effect calculationsalternative tnt equivalency can be calculated as a function of when in the detonation the value is measured and which property is being compareda kiloton of tnt can be visualized as a cube of tnt 8.46 metres 27.8ft on a side1 ton tnt equivalent is approximatelythe relative effectiveness factor re factor relates an explosives demolition power to that of tnt in units of the tnt equivalentkg tntekg the re factor is the relative mass of tnt to which an explosive is equivalent the greater the re the more powerful the explosivethis enables engineers to determine the proper masses of different explosives when applying blasting formulas developed specifically for tnt for example if a timber-cutting formula calls for a charge of 1kg of tnt then based on octanitrocubanes re factor of 2.38 it would take only 1.0/2.38 or 0.42 kg of it to do the same job using petn engineers would need 1.0/1.66 or 0.60 kg to obtain the same effects as 1kg of tnt with anfo or ammonium nitrate they would require 1.0/0.74 or 1.35 kg or 1.0/0.42 or 2.38 kg respectively tbx thermobaric explosives or ebx enhanced blast explosives in a small confined space may have over twice the power of destruction the total power of aluminized mixtures strictly depends on the condition of explosions
