pascal  unit   wikipedia the pascal symbol pa is the si derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure stress youngs modulus and ultimate tensile strength it is defined as one newton per square metre it is named after the french polymath blaise pascalcommon multiple units of the pascal are the hectopascal 1hpa  100pa which is equal to one millibar and the kilopascal 1kpa  1000pa which is equal to one centibarthe unit of measurement called standard atmosphere atm is defined as  and approximates to the average pressure at sea-level at the latitude 45n meteorological reports typically state atmospheric pressure in millibarsthe unit is named after blaise pascal noted for his contributions to hydrodynamics and hydrostatics and experiments with a barometer the name pascal was adopted for the si unit newton per square metre nm by the 14th general conference on weights and measures in 1971the pascal can be expressed using si derived units or alternatively solely si base units aswhere n is the newton m is the metre kg is the kilogram and s is the secondone pascal is the pressure exerted by a force of magnitude one newton perpendicularly upon an area of one square metrethe unit of measurement called atmosphere or standard atmosphere atm is pa 101.325kpa this value is often used as a reference pressure and specified as such in some national and international standards such as iso2787 pneumatic tools and compressors iso2533 aerospace and iso5024 petroleum in contrast iupac recommends the use of 100 kpa as a standard pressure when reporting the properties of substancesthe unicode computer character set has dedicated symbols    and    in the cjk compatibility block but these exist for backward-compatibility with some older ideographic character-sets and are therefore deprecatedthe pascal pa or kilopascal kpa as a unit of pressure measurement is widely used throughout the world and has largely replaced the pounds per square inch psi unit except in some countries that still use the imperial measurement system or the us customary system including the united statesgeophysicists use the gigapascal gpa in measuring or calculating tectonic stresses and pressures within the earthmedical elastography measures tissue stiffness non-invasively with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging and often displays the youngs modulus or shear modulus of tissue in kilopascalsin materials science and engineering the pascal measures the stiffness tensile strength and compressive strength of materials in engineering use because the pascal represents a very small quantity the megapascal mpa is the preferred unit for these usesthe pascal is also equivalent to the si unit of energy density jm this applies not only to the thermodynamics of pressurised gases but also to the energy density of electric magnetic and gravitational fieldsin measurements of sound pressure or loudness of sound one pascal is equal to 94 decibels spl the quietest sound a human can hear known as the threshold of hearing is 0dbspl or 20pathe airtightness of buildings is measured at 50pathe units of atmospheric pressure commonly used in meteorology were formerly the bar which was close to the average air pressure on earth and the millibar since the introduction of si units meteorologists generally measure pressures in hectopascals hpa unit equal to 100 pascals or 1 millibar exceptions include canada which use kilopascals kpa in many other fields of science the si is preferred which means pa with a prefix in multiples of 1000 is preferredmany countries also use the millibar or hectopascal to give aviation altimeter settings in practically all other fields the kilopascal 1000 pascals is used instead
