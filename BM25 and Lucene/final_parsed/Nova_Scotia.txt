shaping nova scotia initially nova scotiathe 14th american colony as some called itdisplayed ambivalence over whether the colony should join the more southern colonies in their defiance of britain and rebellion flared at the battle of fort cumberland 1776 and at the siege of saint john 1777 throughout the war american privateers devastated the maritime economy by capturing ships and looting almost every community outside of halifax these american raids alienated many sympathetic or neutral nova scotians into supporting the british by the end of the war nova scotia had outfitted a number of privateers to attack american shipping british military forces based at halifax succeeded in preventing american support for rebels in nova scotia and deterred any invasion of nova scotia however the british navy failed to establish naval supremacy while the british captured many american privateers in battles such as the naval battle off halifax 1782 many more continued attacks on shipping and

british administration divided nova scotia and carved out the present-day province of new brunswick in 1784 the loyalist exodus created new communities across nova scotia including shelburne which briefly became one of the larger british settlements in north america and infused nova scotia with additional capital and skills however the migration also caused political tensions between loyalist leaders and the leaders of the existing new england planters settlement the loyalist influx also pushed nova scotias mikmaq people to the margins as loyalist land grants encroached on ill-defined native lands as part of the loyalist migration about 3,000 black loyalists arrived they founded the largest free black settlement in north america at birchtown near shelburne however unfair treatment and harsh conditions caused about one-third of the black loyalists to resettle in sierra leone in 1792 where they founded freetown and became known in africa as the nova scotian settlersduring the war
