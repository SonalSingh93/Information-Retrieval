sixth winter published in 1979 have similar themes before and during the films release members of environmental and political advocacy groups distributed pamphlets to moviegoers describing the possible effects of global warming although the film depicts effects of global warming predicted by scientists such as rising sea levels more destructive storms and disruption of ocean currents and weather patterns it depicts their occurrence more rapidly and severely than what is considered scientifically plausible the theory that a superstorm could create rapid worldwide climate change does not appear in the scientific literatureto choose a studio writer michael wimer created an auction a copy of the script was sent to all major studios along with a term sheet they had 24 hours to decide

insensitivity in his inclusion of scenes of a devastated new york city less than three years after the september 11 attacks emmerich said that it was necessary to showcase the increased unity of people in the face of disaster because of the attackssome scientists criticized the films scientific aspects paleoclimatologist and professor of earth and planetary science at harvard university daniel p schrag said on the one hand im glad that theres a big-budget movie about something as critical as climate change on the other im concerned that people will see these over-the-top effects and think the whole thing is a joke  we are indeed experimenting with the earth in a way that hasnt been done for millions of years but youre not going to see another ice age  at least not like that j marshall shepherd a research meteorologist at the nasa goddard space flight center expressed a similar sentiment im heartened that theres a movie addressing real climate issues but as for the science of the movie id give it a d minus or an f and id be concerned if the movie was made to advance a political agenda according to university of victoria climatologist andrew weaver its the towering inferno of climate science movies but im not losing any sleep over a new ice age because its impossiblepatrick j michaels a former research professor of environmental science at the university of
