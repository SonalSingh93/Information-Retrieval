used for the port of veracruz and created by the spanish in the early 16th centurythe state is a crescent-shaped strip of land wedged between the sierra madre oriental to the west and the gulf of mexico to the east its total area is 78,815km 30,431sqmi accounting for about 3.7% of mexicos total territory it stretches about 650km 403.9mi north to south but its width varies from between 212km 132mi to 36km 22mi with an average of about 100km 62mi in width veracruz shares common borders with the states of tamaulipas to the north oaxaca and chiapas to the south tabasco to the southeast and puebla hidalgo and san luis potos on the west veracruz has 690km 429mi of coastline with the gulf of mexicothe natural geography can be categoried into nine regions the sierra de zongolica the tecolutla region the huayacocotla region the metlac river area the tuxtlas region the central region the laguna del castillo region the pueblo viejo-tamiahua region and the laguna de alvarado region the topography changes drastically rising from the narrow coastal plains to the highlands of the eastern sierra madre elevation varies from sea level to the pico de orizaba mexicos highest peak at 5,636m 18,491ft above sea level the coast consists of low sandy strips interspersed with tidewater streams and lagoons most of the long coastline is narrow and sandy with unstable dunes small shifting lagoons and points the mountains are of the sierra madre oriental and the trans-mexican volcanic belt mountain ranges include the sierra de topila sierra de otontepec sierra de huayacocotla sierra de coxquihui sierra de chiconquiaco sierra de jalacingo sierra de axocuapan sierra de huatusco sierra de zongolica and the sierra de los tuxtla major peaks include pico de orizaba 5,636m 18,491ft cofre de perote 4,282m 14,048.6ft cerro de tecomates 3,227m 10,587ft cerro del viga alta 3,055m 10,023ft and cerro de 3 tortas 2,997m 9,833ft the pico de orizaba is covered in snow year round the cofre de perote is covered in winter major valleys include the acultzingo crdoba maltrata orizaba and san andrsmore than 40 rivers and tributaries provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power they also carry rich silt down from the eroding highlands which is deposited in the valleys and coastal areas all of the rivers and streams that cross the state begin in the sierra madre oriental or in the central mesa flowing east to the gulf of mexico the important ones include actopan river acuatempan river ro blanco cazones river coatzacoalcos river ro de la antigua hueyapan river jamapa river nautla river pnuco river papaloapan river tecolutla river tonal river tuxpan river and xoloapa river the largest in terms of water discharge are the pnuco tuxpan papaloapan coazocoalcos and uxpanapa the panuco tuxpan papaloapan and coatzacoalcos are navigable two of mexicos most polluted rivers the coatzacoalcos and the ro blanco are located in the state much of the pollution comes from industrial sources but the discharge of sewerage and uncontrolled garbage disposal are also major contributors the state has very few sewage treatment plants with only 10% of sewage being treated before dischargethe state also has ten major waterfalls and ten major coastal lagoons there is only one significant lake called lake catemaco off the coast are the islands of isla de lobos isla de los burros isla de sacrificios isla de salmendina isla del idolo isladel toro isla frijoles isla juan a ramirez isla pajaros and isla terrn and the ocean reefs called blanquilla medio tangillo tuxpan gualleguilla gallega anegada de adento anegada de afuera and cabezothe large variation of altitude results in a large mixture of climates from cold snow-topped mountain peaks to warm wet tropical areas on the coast 32% of the state is classified as hot and humid 52% as hot and semi humid 9% is warm and humid 6% as temperate and humid and 1% is classified as cold hot and humid and hot and semi-humid climates dominate from sea level to about 1,000m 3,280.8ft above sea level average annual temperature ranges from 22 to 26c with precipitation varying from 2,000mm 78.7in to just over 3,500mm 137.8in per year cooler and humid climates are found at elevations between 1,000m 3,280.8ft and 1,600m 5,249.3ft these have an average temperature of between 18 and 22c with precipitation varying between 2,000mm 78.7in and 2,500mm 98.4in temperate climates are found at higher altitudes between 1,600m 5,249.3ft and 2,800m 9,186.4ft temperatures here vary from 12 to 18c with precipitation varying more between 500mm 19.7in and 2,500mm 98.4in cold climates are found at the highest elevations reaching up to the cofre de perote and the pico de orizaba there is a small semi arid region around the city of perote and the west of the huasteca area this is due to a rain shadow caused by the trans-mexican volcanic belt and the sierra madre oriental which do not permit the flow of moist gulf air to this regionvarious types of forest cover the state but evergreen tropical forest dominate the states ecoregion is of great importance for many plant and animal species it is a center of plant endemism and has two separate endemic bird areasthe northern part of the state as well as the higher mountain areas are convergence zones between lowland evergreen tropical forests and more temperate flora and fauna it is also the northernmost occurrence of subhumid tropical forest in mexico although little of this remains mostly on steep slopes this tropical forest is situated in the northeastern coastal plain and extends into southern tamaulipas state on the east side of the sierra madre oriental the soils here are volcanic and shallow but with rich organic matter species that predominate include mayan breadnut brosimum alicastrum sapodilla manilkara zapota rosadillo celtis monoica bursera simaruba dendropanax arboreus and sideroxylon capiri this ecoregion extends into the central part of the state with vegetation changing to include mahogany swietenia macrophylla sapodilla manilkara zapota bernoullia flammea and astronium graveolens veracruz has been described as having one of the richest varieties of wildlife in the western hemisphere there is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous arsenura armida as well as insects the state is known for its many arachnids and features over 25 species of tarantula theraphosidae of which many are endemic the state is part of birdlife internationals endemic bird areaeba project due to the number of endemic birds here some of these include green-cheeked amazon amazona viridigenalis tamaulipas crow corvus imparatus altamira yellowthroat geothlypis flavovelata and crimson-collared grosbeak rhodothraupis celaeno despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents peromyscus ochraventer neotoma angustapalata the jaguar panthera onca ocelot leopardus pardalis jaguarundi herpailurus yaguarondi and coati nasua narica  the endangered bairds tapir may occasionally be spotted in the states southern jungle regions such as bisfera los tuxtlas this region is also the northernmost extent of the primate alouatta palliata or mantled howlermost of veracruzs native forests have been destroyed and replaced by scrub and secondary communities of trees from 1900 to 1987 over 18,553km 7,163.4sqmi of forest had been logged resulting in the loss of habitat and biodiversity much of the logging is due to commercial timber search for tropical hardwoods and the clearing of land for local farmers especially for cattle grazing only 20% of veracruzs original ecosystem remains with 64% transformed by human exploitation despite some efforts at conservation and reclamation exploitation continues to put pressure on remaining wild areasthe state has 31 environmentally protected areas in 21 different municipalities nine are urban parks three are national parks pico de orizaba cofre de perote and san jos de los molinos  the cofre de perote national park is 11,700 hectares of pine and oyamel forest which was created in 1937 the los tuxtlas biosphere reserve covers the municipalities of ngel r cabada santiago tuxtla san andres tuxtla catemaco soteapan mecayapan pajapan and tatahuicapan for a total of 155,122ha 383,314.8 acres it contains various volcanos such as san martn and santa marta and rich biodiversity as it stretches from sea level to higher elevations with 16 climate regions groups into four climate types forest types range from evergreen tropical rainforest to pine 75% of species here are also found in central america and there is a total of 2,368 plant species some such as costus dirzoi daphnopsis megacarpa eugenia sotoesparzae inga sinacae miconia ibarrae mormodes tuxtlensis and thelypteris rachyflexuosa are native only to this area wildlife includes 102 mammal species 49 amphibian 109 reptilian 561 bird species and more species in danger of extinction include the jaguar spider monkey and anteater the veracruz reef system is also considered to be a national park and is mostly off the coast of veracruz city boca del ro and alvarado the area includes coral reefs seaweed beds and other marine vegetation covering an area of 52,239ha 129,085.4 acres there are seventeen reefs in total some of which jut above the surface to form small islands this system links with the reef systems of campeche and yucatn the history of the native peoples of the state of veracruz is complex in the pre-columbian period the modern-day state of veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures the huastecs and otomis occupied the north while the totonacs resided in the north-center the olmecs one of the oldest cultures in the americas became dominant in the southern part of veracruz remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as pnuco castillo de teayo el zapotal las higueras quiahuiztln el tajn cempoala tres zapotes and san lorenzo tenochtitln the first major civilization in the territory of the current state was that of the olmecs the olmecs lived in the coatzacoalcos river region and it became the center of olmec culture the main ceremonial center here was san lorenzo tenochtitln other major centers in the state include tres zapotes in the city of veracruz and la venta in tabasco the culture reached its height about 2600 years ago with its best-known artistic expression being the colossal stone heads these ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period for this reason many anthropologists consider the olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many mesoamerican cultures that followed it by 300 bce this culture was eclipsed by other emerging civilizations in mesoamericaanother major group was the totonacs who have survived to the present day their region called totonacapan is centered between the cazones river and the papaloapan river in the north of the state pre-columbian totonacs lived from hunting fishing and agriculture mostly of corn beans chili peppers and squash this is also the native region of the vanilla bean clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture the major site is el tajn located near papantla but the culture reached its apogee in cempoala about five miles 8km inland from the current port of veracruz when it was conquered by the aztecs when the spaniards arrived in 1519 the territory was still home to a population of about 250,000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four totonac dialects 25,000 were living in cempoala alonethe huastecs are in the far north of the veracruz and extend into parts of tamaulipas hidalgo san luis potos quertaro and puebla the language and agricultural techniques of these people and the maya are similar however only a few buildings and ceramics remain from the early huastec culture this culture also reached its peak between 1200 and 1519 when it was conquered by the spanishduring the 15th and very early 16th century the aztecs came to dominate much of the state and dividing it into tributary provinces of tochtepec cuetlaxtlan cempoallan quauhtochco jalapa misantla and tlatlauhquitepec the aztecs were interested in the areas vegetation and crops such as cedars fruit cotton cacao corn beans and vanilla however the totonacs chafed under aztec rule with aztec rulers from axayacatl to moctezuma ii having to send soldiers to quell rebellions the huastecs were subjugated more successfully by the aztecs and relegated to the provinces of atlan and tochpanveracruz played an important part in the spanish conquest of the aztec empire by hernn corts and his expedition members they founded villa rica de la vera cruz on may 18 1519 as the first spanish town in what is now mexico by doing so corts threw off the authority of the governor of cuba diego velquez and took authority from the town council cabildo of veracruz and claim authority directly from the spanish crown a small contingent of the expedition remained at veracruz while the main body of conquerors moved inlandthe totonacs were the first people with whom the spanish had contact on the american mainland the very first contact was with captain juan de grijalva on the coastline north of the present-day city of veracruz still chafing under aztec rule totonac ruler tlacochcalcatl welcomed hernn corts and promised 50,000 warriors to help defeat tenochtitlan the spanish helped the totonacs expel aztec tribute collectors and to seize control of some aztec outposts the spanish founded the port city of veracruz on the coast as the first municipality under the direct control of the king of spain corts then began his march inland to tenochtitlan during the conquest the rest of the totonac peoples allied themselves with the spanish but the huastecs despite also being under aztec rule fought against them after the fall of tenochtitlan corts sent a regiment to subdue the huastecsduring the early conquest era corts distributed the labor of indigenous settlements to particular conquerors in an institution known as encomienda the indigenous ruler of the settlement was charged with mobilization labor and tribute that was due the holder of the encomienda veracruz had a number of encomiendas that changed hands a number of times but early on came under the direct control of the spanish crown rather than individual encomenderosduring the colonial era veracruz was the main port of entry for immigrants from spain african slaves and all types of luxury goods for import and export the first group of franciscans arrived in veracruz in 1524 walking barefoot to the capital of the spanish colony of new spain the route between veracruz and the spanish capital of mexico city built on the site of the aztec capital tenochtitlan was the key trade route during the colonial era much of the history of the state is involved with the port city that corts founded in 1519 veracruz became the principal and often only port to export and import goods between the colony of new spain and spain itself to ensure the ports monopoly it came to have control over almost all of new spains gulf coastline new spains silver and cochineal red dye were the two most important exports from the port along with chocolate vanilla chili peppers and much more were exported imported were livestock sheep cows goats horses wheat and other cultivars from the caribbean slaves pineapple and sugar cane were introduced this made the port a highly prized target for pirates during the colonial period with attacks and sackings frequent this led to the building of the fort of san juan de ula and the fortification of the city overallmuch of totonac and huastec culture have survived the colonial period into the present day much of the reason for this is that the north of veracruz is rugged with thick vegetation and relatively little of the resources the spanish were looking for veracruz is considered to be where the mestizo or mixed europeanindigenous race began which is a large part of mexican cultural identitythough the spaniards had halted the azrtec wars and human sacrifices an unexpected problem arose european diseases decimated the native population of the province prompting the importation of african slaves during the colonial period starting in the 16th century the spanish imported between 500,0001,000,000 west african slaves into mexico between 1535 and 1767 miscegenation between indigenous and african population began almost immediately new spain did not have any laws prohibiting interracial marriage hence the correct term is afro-mestizo which includes all 3 races indigenous african and spanishrunaway slaves cimarrones became problematic to public order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways crown efforts against these groups began in earnest in the late sixteenth century but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 in the areas of villa rica nueva veracruz antn lizardo and the rio blanco area however the gravest of these occurred in the orizaba area where there were about 500 fugitive slaves in 1609 a leader named gaspar yanga led an insurrection against the spanish but was defeated in battle unrest continued eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the africans the right to form their own community exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed this was called san lorenzo de zerral but today it is known as the municipality of yanga this was the first time slavery was abolished in the americasin the first half of the seventeenth century cities such as crdoba orizaba and xalapa were formed or expanded to protect the trade route between mexico city and the port of veracruz during this time the spanish and mixed-race population increased as the purely indigenous population continued to fall to a fraction of pre-conquest levels due now to mixing rather than disease almost all trade in and out of new spain had to be with spain except for some limited trade authorized with england and other spanish colonies this would stay in place until 1778 when the decreto de libre comercio allowing a limited free trade within spanish-held realms lifted many of these restrictions on trade with europe this would make the port more important than it had been and led to increased prosperity for the inhabitantsoutside of the port in other areas of the province the economy was based on agriculture livestock and commerce in 1720 xalapa organized the first trade fair making it the center for trade between inland mexican goods and those from abroad this would lead to its eventual status as capital of the statein 1746 the state was divided into the civil jurisdictions of pnuco tampico huayacocotla huauchinango papantla misantla xalapa jalacingo veracruz crdoba orizaba cosamaloapan tuxtla and cotaxtlathe port city of veracruz and the fort of san juan de ula where corts landed three hundred years earlier was where the loyalist soldiers of the spanish crown made their last stand against the independence movement in 1824during the mexican war of independence there was support for the insurgents in many parts of the state with skirmishes erupting in various parts as early as 1811 a major conspiracy against the colonial government was discovered in the port in 1812 with rebels taking ayahualulco and ixhuacn during the same year this forced royalist troops to withdraw to xalapa eventually this city along with the port were cut off from mexico city most of the state remained in rebel hands during the rest of the war although the commercial class of the port did not support the effort in 1821 juan de odonoj the last viceroy of new spain came to the port to leave for spain however until 1823 spanish troops continued to occupy san juan de ula fort in 1826 the city would receive the first of its four titles of heroic city for confronting these remaining spanish troopswhile the last of the spanish held on in san juan de ula agustn de iturbide had been declared the emperor of mexico in 1822 however his reign quickly encountered resistance from those favoring a republican form of government including from antonio lpez de santa anna from his stronghold in veracruz state months later iturbide would go into exile and santa anna would eventually hold nine terms as presidentthe french intervened in mexico through veracruz for the first time in the 1838 in what became the pastry war the port was blockaded efforts to defend the country were coordinated from xalapa the port was bombarded but eventually a settlement was reachedduring the mexicanamerican war the port was blockaded again this time by the americans initial american attempts in 1847 to land in alvarado were checked but the americans then made a plan to land a few miles south of veracruz which surrendered after a 20-day siege defeated general santa annas forces at the battle of cerro gordo and marched inland through xalapa towards mexico city led by general winfield scott  mexico surrendered shortly afterthe municipalities of tuxpan and chicontepec belonged to puebla until 1853 when they were annexed to veracruz to give the state its final form in 1855 the state government palace was constructed during the reform war the major player was ignacio de la llave whose name is part of the states official designation in 1858 the port became the site for the liberal government under benito jurez after he was forced out of mexico city during the reform war their control of this port and its customs duties allowed liberal forces to gather resources conservative forces attacked the state but were repelled from both the port and xalapathe reform war wrecked mexicos economy and it found itself unable to pay debts it owed to europe as a result jurez cancelled mexicos foreign debt spain britain and france all outraged by this action decided in october 1861 to force repayment of their loans by the occupation of the mexican gulf coast normally this move would have been blocked by the united states under the monroe doctrine however that nation was occupied with a civil war at the time and the european powers believed that the americans could not act in december spanish troops commanded by general manuel gasset occupied the port of veracruz without any local resistance followed a month later by french and british forces the spanish and the british withdrew after making deals with jurez but the french pushed on to establish the reign of maximilian i of mexico however this was short-lived and the french were expelled through veracruz in 1866/67in 1863 the state was officially named veracruz-llave after the french were expelled the state government was in the port of veracruz in 1878 the capital was transferred to orizaba it was later moved to xalapa in 1885by the end of the century many infrastructure improvements such as roads and railways especially the ferrocarril interocenico had been completed with the major cities being veracruz orizaba xalapa crdoba jalacingo chicontepec and tantoyuca the discovery of oil in the north of the state attracted foreign firms which brought machinery needed for its extraction these companies included huasteca company petroleum and el aguila along with american and english firms during the same time period uprisings against the government under porfirio daz in the agricultural south of the state were brutally repressedunrest against the daz regime continued until the outbreak of the mexican revolution ousted him from power the major event leading up to this war in veracruz was the cigar-makers strike of 1905 when more than 5,000 workers of the el valle nacional company walked off the job the governor teodora a dehesa unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a settlement the strike went on for months until the strikers won this victory encouraged more actions until strikes at the factories in rio blanco nogales santa rosa and contn de orizaba resulted in dramatic violence in january 1907 no major battles of the mexican revolution were fought in the state though there were skirmishes and attacks on the port by 1914 rebel cndido agular occupied a number of municipalities in the state and in 1917 venustiano carranza transferred the federal government here temporarilyon april 21 1914 an incident involving us sailors in tampico led president woodrow wilson to land american troops in veracruz where they remained for six months mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relationsafter the revolution agrarian reform including the redistribution of land and the creation of ejidos took place here the oil companies in the north of the state were nationalized and consolidated into pemex in the 1930s by lzaro crdenas in the 1950s more road construction such as the mexico city- poza rica veracruz-alvarado- coatzacoalco and tinajas-ciudad aleman-tlacoatalpan highways were constructed the universidad veracruzana was expanded as well in 1960 the museum of anthropology in xalapa was inaugurated as well as the coatzacoalco-salina cruz highway the veracruz city international airport was opened in the 1970sveracruz has one of mexicos leading economies based on agriculture and petroleum using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with gross county product the informal sector of the local economy in veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the fox administration though the regional government remained pri the assumption that the informal economy of mexico is a constant 30% of total economic activity is not supported at the local level the small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in veracruz but not enough to warrant including an i-statistic as a regressor global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy while indigenous people are relatively poor little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people while the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000 by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality while rural municipios have smaller economies they are not different than urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenuesthe primary sector of the economy agriculture forestry and fishing has been important since pre-hispanic times and continues to be important both as a source of income as well as culturally the state has abundant rainfall and extremely fertile soils as well as a long coastline and forest containing a wide variety of trees and other plantsthere is about 1 million hectares of cultivable land half of which is in private hands and 43% is ejido or communal land the rest is occupied by human settlements there are 3,620 ejidos parceled out to 270,000 ejido members 52.5% of agricultural land is used for the growing of crops or used as pasture and 43.1% is forest or rainforest chief agricultural products include coffee vanilla sugarcane tobacco bananas coconuts and vegetables but local farmers depend mainly on corn and beans two corn crops per year are generally produced planted on 644,936 hectares with a production of 1,114,325 tons the state is the leading national producer of coffee sugarcane corn and rice coffee is grown on 152,993 hectares producing 400,575 tons export earnings from this crop are about 232 million usd annually most coffee is grown in the mountain areas of crdoba-huatusco coatepec-teocelo-cosautln and misantla-tlapacoyan-atzalan sugarcane is cultivated on 254,000 hectares producing 16,867,958 tons annually veracruz is the largest producer of rice with 24,000 hectares producing 120,000 tons much is this crop is protected by import bans from asiathe state grows half of the countrys citrus fruit and grows the most kinds this occupies 180,577 hectares and produces 2,575,140 tons annually varieties include oranges tangerines mandarins limes and grapefruit most citrus is grown in the north of the state and much of the lime crop is exported supporting a packing and shipping industry veracruz is the largest mango producer in the country grown on 31,640 hectares producing 287,000 tons most of this is the manila variety which is preferred in mexico 95% of this crop is consumed fresh within mexico although exports to canada have begun vanilla beans are native to the state which is the primary producer for mexico most of this crop is grown in an area known as totonacapan in and around papantlalivestock raising is an important activity there are over 300,000 units of production most of which raise cattle with veracruz being the main beef producer for the country at 14% of the total in addition to beef cattle dairy cattle pigs sheep goats horses domestic fowl and bees are raisedfrom the tropical forests of the inland regions come dyewoods hardwoods and rubber about 20% of the states territory is forested with 220,000 of temperate forest and 1,200,000 hectares of tropical forests logging in the state produces 128,254 m3 of wood products per year the most exploited species include pine oyamel cypress and oak some tropical hardwoods are harvested as wellveracruzs long coastline supports a large fishing industry producing one-fifth of mexicos catch most of the countrys mojarra oysters and shrimp come from here other major fish catches include crab sea bass and red snapperagroindustry focuses on the processing of coffee and sugar products with citrus packers holding an important position as welltoday the state of veracruz rich in natural resources is an important component of mexicos economy approximately 35% of mexicos water supply is found in veracruz there are a number of metallic and non-metallic mineral mining but the most important resource is oilthe mountains contain relatively unexploited deposits of gold silver iron and coal although veracruz is an important source of metals such as iron and copper a great deal of its mining involves non-metallic minerals as sulfur silica feldspar calcium kaolin and marble the state is ranked fourth in the nation for this kind of mining production however mining only accounts for 1.5% of economic activity for the entire stateveracruz was a pioneer in both the extraction and refining of petroleum products the state has about one-fourth of mexicos petroleum reserves and ranks third in petroleum production most of this production is concentrated in the northern part of the state approximately 40,000,000 barrels 6,400,000m of oil are produced each year and 109,870,000,000 cubic feet 3.11110m of natural gas petrochemicals represent 28.1% of the states manufacturing and ranks first nationally there are 22 petrochemical plants with the most important being la cangrejera jltipan de morelos poza rica cosoleacaque pajaritos and minatitlnthe golden lane dos bocas-alamo structure or the ridge refers to a series of oil fields aligned in an arc onshore and a symmetrical alignment offshore forming two sides of a cretaceous atoll 180km long the structure was discovered in 1908 by weetman pearsons mexican eagle petroleum company san diego de la mar no 1 well which flowed 2,500 bblday the golden lane oil fields penetrate a massive elliptical reef platform identified as the sierra del abra limestone consisting of reef backreef and lagoonal facies which dips southeast the site for the discovery well was selected due to the presence of petroleum seeps just as was edward laurence dohenys la paz no well in the ebano-panuco petroleum district west of tampico tamaulipas the first mexican discovery well in 1904 in 1908 the infamous dos bocas oil fire occurred after the san diego de la mar no 3 blowout this was followed by the potrero del llano no 4 well flowing 100,000 bbl per day during the three months it was out of control dohenys cerro azul no 4 well located by ezequiel ordonez became the largest daily production record holder in 1916 at 260,000 bbl geophysical studies in particular gravimetry starting in 1920 led to the discovery of the poza rica field in 1932 and moralillo field in 1948 on the west flank of the golden lane in the tamabra forereef facies refraction seismography surveys started in 1930 augemented in 1948 with reflection seismography which led to the discovery of the southern extent of the atoll with the ezequiel ordonez no 1 well in 1952 and additional discoveries through 1968 marine seismic and magnetometer surveys starting in 1957 showed the extent of the atoll offshore and led to the first offshore well isla de lobos no 1-b in 1963 the depths of wells are on the order of 500 m onshore and 2000 m offshorelaguna verde nuclear power plant lvnpp in alto lucero veracruz produces about 4.5% of mexicos electrical energythe manufacturing industry in veracruz accounts for between 21% and one-third of the states gross domestic product and approximately 64% of the manufacturing industry gdp is generated by the chemical and petrochemical
