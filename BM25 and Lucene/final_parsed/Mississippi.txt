mississippi  wikipedia mississippi  is a state in the southern region of the united states with part of its southern border formed by the gulf of mexico its western border is formed by the mississippi riverthe state has a population of approximately 3 million it is the 32nd most extensive and the 32nd most populous of the 50 united states located in the center of the state jackson is the state capital and largest city with a population of approximately 175,000 peoplethe state is heavily forested outside of the mississippi delta area between the mississippi and yazoo rivers before the american civil war most development in the state was along riverfronts where slaves worked on cotton plantations after the war the bottomlands to the interior were cleared mostly by freedmen by the end of the 19th century african americans made up two-thirds of the deltas property owners but timber and railroad companies acquired much of the land after a financial crisisclearing altered the deltas ecology increasing the severity of flooding along the mississippi much land is now held by agribusinesses a largely rural state with agricultural areas dominated by industrial farms mississippi is ranked low or last among the states in such measures as health educational attainment and median household income the states catfish aquaculture farms produce the majority of farm-raised catfish consumed in the united statessince the 1930s and the great migration mississippi has been majority white albeit with the highest percentage of black residents of any us state from the early 19th century to the 1930s its residents were mostly black a population that before the american civil war was composed largely of african american slaves democratic party whites retained political power through jim crow laws in the first half of the 20th century nearly 400,000 rural blacks left the state for work and opportunities in northern and midwestern cities with another wave of migration around world war ii to west coast cities in 2010 37% of mississippians were african americans the highest percentage of african americans in any us state since gaining enforcement of their voting franchise in the late 1960s most african americans support democratic candidates in local state and national elections conservative whites have shifted to the republican party african americans are a majority in many counties of the mississippi-yazoo delta an area of historic settlement during the plantation era since 2011 mississippi has been ranked as the most religious state in the countrythe states name is derived from the mississippi river which flows along its western boundary settlers named it after the ojibwe word misi-ziibi great rivermississippi is bordered to the north by tennessee to the east by alabama to the south by louisiana and a narrow coast on the gulf of mexico and to the west across the mississippi river by louisiana and arkansasin addition to its namesake major rivers in mississippi include the big black river the pearl river the yazoo river the pascagoula river and the tombigbee river major lakes include ross barnett reservoir arkabutla lake sardis lake and grenada lake with the largest lake being sardis lakemississippi is entirely composed of lowlands the highest point being woodall mountain in the foothills of the cumberland mountains 807 feet 246m above sea level the lowest point is sea level at the gulf coast the states mean elevation is 300 feet 91m above sea levelmost of mississippi is part of the east gulf coastal plain the coastal plain is generally composed of low hills such as the pine hills in the south and the north central hills the pontotoc ridge and the fall line hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations yellow-brown loess soil is found in the western parts of the state the northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the alabama black beltthe coastline includes large bays at bay st louis biloxi and pascagoula it is separated from the gulf of mexico proper by the shallow mississippi sound which is partially sheltered by petit bois island horn island east and west ship islands deer island round island and cat islandthe northwest remainder of the state consists of the mississippi delta a section of the mississippi alluvial plain the plain is narrow in the south and widens north of vicksburg the region has rich soil partly made up of silt which had been regularly deposited by the flood waters of the mississippi riverareas under the management of the national park service

and about 48f about 9c in january the temperature varies little statewide in the summer however in winter the region near mississippi sound is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state the recorded temperature in mississippi has ranged from 19f 28c in 1966 at corinth in the northeast to 115f 46c in 1930 at holly springs in the north heavy snowfall is possible across the state such as during the new years eve 1963 snowstorm yearly precipitation generally increases from north to south with the regions closer to the gulf being the most humid thus clarksdale in the northwest gets about 50inches about 1,270mm of precipitation annually and biloxi in the south about 61inches about 1,550mm small amounts of snow fall in northern and central mississippi snow is occasional in the southern part of the statethe late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for hurricanes moving inland from the gulf of mexico especially in the southern part of the state hurricane camille in 1969 and hurricane katrina in 2005 which killed 238 people in the state were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state both caused nearly total storm surge destruction of structures in and around gulfport biloxi and pascagoulaas in the rest of the deep south thunderstorms are common in mississippi especially in the southern part of the state on average mississippi has around 27 tornadoes annually the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year two of the five deadliest tornadoes in us history have occurred in the state these storms struck natchez in southwest mississippi see the great natchez tornado and tupelo in the northeast corner of the state about seven f5 tornadoes have been recorded in the statemississippi is heavily forested with over half of the states area covered by wild trees including mostly pine as well as cottonwood elm hickory oak pecan sweetgum and tupelodue to seasonal flooding possible from december to june the mississippi and yazoo rivers and their tributaries created a fertile floodplain in the mississippi delta the rivers flooding created natural levees which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops temporary workers built levees along the mississippi river on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river floodedfrom 1858 to 1861 the state took over levee building accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor in those years planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work contractors hired gangs of irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land many of the irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established before the american civil war the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height although in some areas they reached twenty feetflooding has been an integral part of mississippi history but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth the banks of the river were denuded becoming unstable and changing the character of the river after the civil war major floods swept down the valley in 1865 1867 1874 and 1882 such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by confederate and union fighting during the war as well as those constructed after the war in 1877 the state created the mississippi levee district for southern countiesin 1879 the united states congress created the mississippi river commission whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees both white and black transient workers were hired to build the levees in the late 19th century by 1882 levees averaged seven feet in height but many in the southern delta were severely tested by the flood that year after the 1882 flood the levee system was expanded in 1884 the yazoo-mississippi delta levee district was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern delta counties also included were some counties in arkansas which were part of the deltaflooding overwhelmed northwestern mississippi in 19121913 causing heavy damage to the levee districts regional losses and the mississippi river levee associations lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts on a scale of 2:1 although us participation in world war i interrupted funding of levees the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the mississippi-yazoo delta to 22 feet 6.7m in the 1920s scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains the region was severely damaged due to the great mississippi flood of 1927 which broke through the levees there were losses of millions of dollars in property stock and crops the most damage occurred in the lower delta including washington and bolivar countieseven as scientific knowledge about the mississippi river has grown upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover strengthening the rivers current the state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecologynear 10,000 bc native americans or paleo-indians arrived in what today is referred to as the american south paleoindians in the south were hunter-gatherers who pursued the megafauna that became extinct following the end of the pleistocene age in the mississippi delta native american settlements and agricultural fields were developed on the natural levees higher ground in the proximity of rivers the native americans developed extensive fields near their permanent villages together with other practices they created some localized deforestation but did not alter the ecology of the mississippi delta as a wholeafter thousands of years succeeding cultures of the woodland and mississippian culture eras developed rich and complex agricultural societies in which surplus supported the development of specialized trades both were mound builder cultures those of the mississippian culture were the largest and most complex constructed beginning about 950ce the peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the great lakes to the gulf coast their large earthworks which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts still stand throughout the mississippi and ohio river valleysdescendant native american tribes of the mississippian culture in the southeast include the chickasaw and choctaw other tribes who inhabited the territory of mississippi and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns include the natchez the yazoo and the biloxithe first major european expedition into the territory that became mississippi was that of the spanish explorer hernando de soto who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540 in his second expedition to the new worldin april 1699 french colonists established the first european settlement at fort maurepas also known as old biloxi built in the vicinity of present-day ocean springs on the gulf coast it was settled by pierre le moyne diberville in 1716 the french founded natchez on the mississippi river as fort rosalie it became the dominant town and trading post of the area the french called the greater territory new france the spanish continued to claim part of the gulf coast area east of mobile bay of present-day southern alabama in addition to the entire area of present-day floridathrough the 18th century the area was ruled variously by spanish french and british colonial governments the colonists imported african slaves as laborers under french and spanish rule there developed a class of free people of color gens de couleur libres mostly multiracial descendants of european men and enslaved women and their children in the early days the french and spanish colonists were chiefly men even as more european women joined the settlements the men had interracial unions among women of african descent and increasingly multiracial descent both before and after marriages to european women often the european men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades and sometimes they settled property on them they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved as part of contracts of plaage with this social capital the free people of color became artisans and sometimes educated merchants and property owners forming a third class between the europeans and most enslaved africans in the french and spanish settlements although not so large a free community as in the city of new orleans louisiana after great britains victory in the french and indian war seven years war the french surrendered the mississippi area to them under the terms of the treaty of paris 1763 they also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the mississippi river including the illinois country and quebecafter the american revolution 176583 britain ceded this area to the new united states of america the mississippi territory was organized on april 7 1798 from territory ceded by georgia and south carolina to the united states their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the pacific ocean the mississippi territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the united states and spainfrom 1800 to about 1830 the united states purchased some lands treaty of doaks stand from native american tribes for new settlements of european americans they were mostly migrants from other southern states particularly virginia and north carolina where soils were exhausted on september 27 1830 the treaty of dancing rabbit creek was signed between the us government and the choctaw the choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in mississippi and alabama for compensation and removal to reservations in indian territory now oklahoma this opened up land for sale to european-american immigrant settlement article 14 in the treaty allowed those choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become us citizens the second major non-european ethnic group to do so the cherokee were the first today approximately 9,500 choctaw live in neshoba newton leake and jones counties federally recognized tribes include the mississippi band of choctaw indiansmany slaveholders brought slaves with them or purchased them through the domestic slave trade especially in new orleans through the trade nearly one million slaves were transported to the deep south including mississippi in a forced internal migration that broke up many slave families of the upper south where planters were selling excess slaves the southerners imposed slave laws and restricted the rights of free blacks according to their view of white supremacy beginning in 1822 slaves in mississippi were protected by law from cruel and unusual punishment by their owners southern slave codes made the willful killing of a slave illegal in most cases for example the 1860 mississippi case of oliver v state charged the defendant with murdering his own slaveon december 10 1817 mississippi was the 20th state admitted to the union david holmes was elected the first governor of the state plantations were developed primarily along the major rivers where the waterfront provided access to the major transportation routes this is also where early towns developed linked by the steamboats that carried commercial products and crops to markets the backcountry remained largely undeveloped frontier until it was cleared by freedmen during reconstruction and laterwhen cotton was king during the 1850s mississippi plantation ownersespecially those of the delta and black belt central regionsbecame wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil the high price of cotton on the international market and their assets in slaves they used the profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves the planters dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites played strong roles both in state politics and in planters support for secession the state was thinly settled with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and townsby 1860 the enslaved african-american population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the states total of 791,305 there were fewer than 1000 free people of color the relatively low population of the state before the civil war reflected the fact that land and villages were developed only along the riverfronts which formed the main transportation corridors ninety percent of the delta bottomlands were frontier and undeveloped the state needed many more settlers for developmenton january 9 1861 mississippi became the second state to declare its secession from the union and it was one of the founding members of the confederate states the first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves during the war union and confederate forces struggled for dominance on the mississippi river critical to supply routes and commerce more than 80,000 mississippians fought in the civil war and casualties were extremely heavy union general ulysses s grants long siege of vicksburg finally gained the union control of the river in 1863in the postwar period freedmen withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations the majority of blacks left the southern baptist church sharply reducing its membership they created independent black baptist congregations by 1895 they had established numerous black baptist state associations and the national baptist convention of black churchesin addition independent black denominations such as the african methodist episcopal church established in philadelphia pennsylvania and the african methodist episcopal zion church established in new york city sent missionaries to the south in the postwar years they quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the south southern congregations brought their own influences to those denominations as wellduring reconstruction the first mississippi constitutional convention in 1868 with delegates both black and white framed a constitution whose major elements would be maintained for 22 years the convention was the first political organization in the state to include african-american representatives 17 among the 100 members 32 counties had black majorities at the time some among the black delegates were freedmen but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the north the convention adopted universal suffrage did away with property qualifications for suffrage or for office a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites provided for the states first public school system forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel under the terms of reconstruction mississippi was restored to the union on february 23 1870because the mississippi delta contained so much fertile bottomland that had not been developed before the civil war 90 percent of the land was still frontier after the civil war tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land in addition black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and raising timber and eventually advance to ownership the new farmers included many freedmen who achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the mississippi bottomlands by the late 19th century in the 1870s and 1880s many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownershiparound the start of the 20th century two-thirds of the mississippi farmers who owned land in the delta were african american many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the civil war as another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s however numerous african-american farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts thus losing the land which they had developed by personal labordemocrats regained control of the state legislature in 1875 after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the white line campaign based on asserting white supremacy democratic whites became well armed and formed paramilitary organizations such as the red shirts to suppress black voting from 1874 to the elections of 1875 they pressured whites to join the democrats and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known riots in cities around the state to intimidate blacks and suppress their voting they killed a total of 150 blacks although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many a total of three white republicans and five white democrats were reported killed in rural areas deaths of blacks could be covered up riots better described as massacres of blacks took place in vicksburg clinton macon and in their counties as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and lynched known black leaders destroying local political organizations seeing the success of this deliberate mississippi plan south carolina and other states followed it and also achieved white dominance in 1877 the last of federal troops were withdrawn from the regioneven in this environment black mississippians continued to be elected into local office however black residents were deprived of all political power after white legislators passed a new state constitution in 1890 specifically to eliminate the nigger from politics according to the states democratic governor james k vardaman it erected barriers to voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively disenfranchised most black mississippians and many poor whites estimates are that 100,000 black and 50,000 white men were removed from voter registration rolls in the state over the next few yearsthe loss of political influence contributed to the difficulties of african americans in their attempts to obtain extended credit in the late 19th century together with imposition of jim crow and racial segregation laws whites committed an increased rate of lynchings of blacks mostly men beginning in the 1890s and extending to 1930 cotton crops failed due to boll weevil infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913 creating crisis conditions for many african americans with control of the ballot box and more access to credit white planters bought out such farmers expanding their ownership of delta bottomlands they also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the statein 1900 blacks made up more than half of the states population by 1910 a majority of black farmers in the delta had lost their land and become sharecroppers by 1920 the third generation after freedom most african americans in mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty starting about 1913 tens of thousands of black americans left mississippi for the north in the great migration to industrial cities such as st louis chicago detroit cleveland philadelphia and new york they sought jobs better education for their children the right to vote relative freedom from discrimination and better living in the migration of 19101940 they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity most migrants from mississippi took trains directly north to chicago and often settled near former neighborsblacks also faced violence in the form of lynching shooting and the burning of churches in 1923 the national association for the advancement of colored people stated the negro feels that life is not safe in mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white manin the early 20th century some industries were established in mississippi but jobs were generally restricted to whites including child workers the lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as chicago and detroit seeking employment where they also competed with european immigrants the state depended on agriculture but mechanization put many farm laborers out of workby 1900 many white ministers especially in the towns subscribed to the social gospel movement which attempted to apply christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day many strongly supported prohibition believing it would help alleviate and prevent many sinsafrican-american baptist churches grew to include more than twice the number of members as their white baptist counterparts the african-american call for social equality resonated throughout the great depression in the 1930s and world war ii in the 1940sthe second great migration from the south started in the 1940s lasting until 1970 almost half a million people left mississippi in the second migration three-quarters of them black nationwide during the first half of the 20th century african americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs the second great migration included destinations in the west especially california where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both african americans and whitesblacks and whites in mississippi generated rich quintessentially american music traditions gospel music country music jazz blues and rock and roll all were invented promulgated or heavily developed by mississippi musicians many of them african american and most came from the mississippi delta many musicians carried their music north to chicago where they made it the heart of that citys jazz and bluesso many african americans left in the great migration that after the 1930s they became a minority in mississippi in 1960 they made up 42% of the states population the whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890 preventing most blacks from voting even if they were well educated court challenges were not successful until later in the century after world war ii african-american veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the united states and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rightsthe civil rights movement had many roots in religion and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism mississippi was a center of activity based in black churches to educate and register black voters and to work for integration in 1954 the state had created the mississippi state sovereignty commission a tax-supported agency chaired by the governor that claimed to work for the states image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local white citizens councils to suppress black activism white citizens councils had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 united states supreme court ruling brown v board of education that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional they used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists including teachers and other professionals techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housingin the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in mississippi and establish freedom schools the mississippi freedom democratic party was established to challenge the all-white democratic party of the solid south most white politicians resisted such changes chapters of the ku klux klan and its sympathizers used violence against activists most notably the murders of chaney goodman and schwerner in 1964 during the freedom summer campaign this was a catalyst for congressional passage the following year of the voting rights act of 1965 mississippi earned a reputation in the 1960s as a reactionary stateafter decades of disenfranchisement african americans in the state gradually began to exercise their right to vote again for the first time since the 19th century following the passage of federal civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965 which ended de jure segregation and enforced constitutional voting rights registration of african-american voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices the mississippi freedom democratic party fielded some candidates teacher robert g clark of holmes county was the first african american to be elected to the state house since reconstruction he continued as the only african american in the state legislature until 1976 and was repeatedly elected into the 21st century including three terms as speaker of the housein 1966 the state was the last to repeal officially statewide prohibition of alcohol before that mississippi had taxed the illegal alcohol brought in by bootleggers governor paul johnson urged repeal and the sheriff raided the annual junior league mardi gras ball at the jackson country club breaking open the liquor cabinet and carting off the champagne before a startled crowd of nobility and high-ranking state officialson august 17 1969 category 5 hurricane camille hit the mississippi coast killing 248 people and causing us1.5 billion in damage 1969 dollarsin 1987 20 years after the us supreme court had ruled in 1967's loving v virginia that a similar virginian law was unconstitutional mississippi repealed its ban on interracial marriage also known as miscegenation which had been enacted in 1890 it also repealed the segregationist-era poll tax in 1989 in 1995 the state symbolically ratified the thirteenth amendment which had abolished slavery in 1865 though ratified in 1995 the state never officially notified the us archivist which kept the ratification unofficial until 2013 when ken sullivan contacted the office of secretary of state of mississippi delbert hosemann who agreed to file the paperwork and make it official in 2009 the legislature passed a bill to repeal other discriminatory civil rights laws which had been enacted in 1964 the same year as the federal civil rights act but ruled unconstitutional in 1967 by federal courts republican governor haley barbour signed the bill into lawthe end of legal segregation and jim crow led to the integration of some churches but most today remain divided along racial and cultural lines having developed different traditions after the civil war most african americans left white churches to establish their own independent congregations particularly baptist churches establishing state associations and a national association by the end of the century they wanted to express their own traditions of worship and practice in more diverse communities such as hattiesburg some churches have multiracial congregationson august 29 2005 hurricane katrina though a category 3 storm upon final landfall caused even greater destruction across the entire 90 miles 145km of the mississippi gulf coast from louisiana to alabamathe center of population of mississippi is located in leake county in the town of lenathe united states census bureau estimates that the population of mississippi was 2,992,333 on july 1 2015 a 0.84% increase since the 2010 united states census the states economist characterized the state as losing population as job markets elsewhere have caused 3.2 per 1000 to migrate recentlyfrom 2000 to 2010 the united states census bureau reported that mississippi had the highest rate of increase in people identifying as mixed-race up 70 percent in the decade it amounts to a total of 1.1 percent of the population in addition mississippi led the nation for most of the last decade in the growth of mixed marriages among its population the total population has not increased significantly but is young some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births but it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity a binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of racial segregation in the civil rights era people of african descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rightsas the demographer william frey noted in mississippi i think its identifying as mixed race changed from within historically in mississippi after indian removal in the 1830s the major groups were designated as black african american who were then mostly enslaved and white primarily european american matthew snipp also a demographer commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race in a sense theyre rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressedafter having comprised a majority of the states population since well before the civil war and through the 1930s today african americans comprise approximately 37 percent of the states population most have ancestors who were enslaved with many forcibly transported from the upper south in the 19th century to work on the areas new plantations some of these slaves were mixed race with european ancestors as there were many children born into slavery with white fathers some also have native american ancestry during the first half of the 20th century a total of nearly 400,000 african americans left the state during the great migration for opportunities in the north midwest and west they became a minority in the state for the first time since early in its developmentthe state has had conservative laws related to sexuality the states sodomy law criminalized consensual sex between adults of the same gender until 2003 but was seldom enforced when such laws were voided by the supreme court case lawrence v texas in 2004 voters in mississippi approved amendment 1 amending the states constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage the measure passed with 86% of the vote the highest margin of victory in the nation this law was overturned by obergefell v hodges 2015 the decision of the us supreme court making same-sex marriage a constitutional rightdespite conservative laws same-sex couples were forming families in the state according to the 2010 census approximately 33% of households led by same-sex couples in mississippi included at least one child the highest such percentage in the nationat the 2010 us census the racial makeup of the population wasethnically 2.7% of the total population among all racial groups was of hispanic or latino origin they may be of any race as of 2011 53.8% of mississippis population younger than age 1 were minorities meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-hispanic white for more information on racial and ethnic classifications in the united states see race and ethnicity in the united states censusamericans of scots-irish english and scottish ancestry are present throughout the state it is believed that there are more people with such ancestry than identify as such on the census in part because their immigrant ancestors are more distant in their family histories english scottish and scots-irish are generally the most under-reported ancestry groups in both the south atlantic states and the east south central states the historian david hackett fischer estimated that a minimum 20% of mississippis population is of english ancestry though the figure is probably much higher and another large percentage is of scottish ancestry many mississippians of such ancestry identify simply as american on questionnaires because their families have been in north america for centuries in the 1980 census 656,371 mississippians of a total of 1,946,775 identified as being of english ancestry making them 38% of the state at the timethe state in 2010 had the highest proportion of african americans in the nation the african-american percentage of population has begun to increase due mainly to a younger population than the whites the total fertility rates of the two races are approximately equal due to patterns of settlement and whites putting their children in private schools in almost all of mississippis public school districts a majority of students are african american african americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern yazoo delta and the southwestern and the central parts of the state these are areas where historically african americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the civil war or worked on cotton plantations and farmspeople of french creole ancestry form the largest demographic group in hancock county on the gulf coast the african-american choctaw mostly in neshoba county and chinese-american portions of the population are also almost entirely native bornchinese came to mississippi as indentured laborers from cuba during the 1870s with others coming from mainland china in the later 19th century the majority entering the state immigrated directly from china to mississippi between 1910 and 1930 when they were recruited by planters as laborers while most first worked as sharecroppers the chinese worked as families to improve their lives many became small merchants and especially grocers in small towns throughout the delta in these roles the ethnic chinese carved out a niche in the state between black and white where they were concentrated in the delta these small towns have declined since the late 20th century and many ethnic chinese have joined the exodus to larger cities

stressed that obesity starts in early childhood extending into the adolescent years and then possibly into adulthood it noted impediments to needed behavioral modification including the delta likely being the most underserved region in the state with african americans the major ethnic group lack of accessibility and availability of medical care and an estimated 60% of residents living below the poverty level additional risk factors were that most schools had no physical education curriculum and nutrition education is not emphasized previous intervention strategies may have been largely ineffective due to not being culturally sensitive or practical a 2006 survey found nearly 95 percent of mississippi adults considered childhood obesity to be a serious problemthe bureau of economic

contributionsat 56 percent the state has one of the lowest workforce participation rates in the country approximately 70,000 adults are disabled which is 10 percent of the workforcemississippis rank as one of the poorest states is related to its dependence on cotton agriculture before and after the civil war late development of its frontier bottomlands in the mississippi delta repeated natural disasters of flooding in the late 19th and early 20th century that required massive capital investment in levees and ditching and draining the bottomlands and slow development of railroads to link bottomland towns and river cities in addition when democrats regained control of the state legislature they passed the 1890 constitution that discouraged corporate industrial development in favor of rural agriculture a legacy that would slow the states progress for yearsbefore the civil war mississippi was the fifth-wealthiest state in the nation its wealth generated by the labor of slaves in cotton plantations along the rivers slaves were counted as property and the rise in the cotton markets since the 1840s had increased their value by 1860 a majority  55 percent  of the population of mississippi was enslaved ninety percent of the delta bottomlands were undeveloped and the state had low overall density of populationlargely due to the domination of the plantation economy focused on the production of agricultural cotton the states elite was reluctant to invest in infrastructure such as roads and railroads they educated their children privately industrialization did not reach many areas until the late 20th century the planter aristocracy the elite of antebellum mississippi kept the tax structure low for their own benefit making only private improvements before the war the most successful planters such as confederate president jefferson davis owned riverside properties along the mississippi and yazoo rivers in the mississippi delta away from the riverfronts most of the delta was undeveloped frontierduring the civil war 30,000 mississippi soldiers mostly white died from wounds and disease and many more were left crippled and wounded changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the south caused severe losses in wealth in 1860 assessed valuation of property in mississippi had been more than 500 million of which 218 million 43 percent was estimated as the value of slaves by 1870 total assets had decreased in value to roughly 177 millionpoor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression the constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens the committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes it took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles the upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war by 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figuresblacks cleared land selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership in 1900 two-thirds of farm owners in mississippi were blacks a major achievement for them and their families due to the poor economy low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties two decades later the majority of african americans were sharecroppers the low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of african americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debtsafter the civil war the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens in addition the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the boll weevil in the early 20th century devastating floods in 19121913 and 1927 collapse of cotton prices after 1920 and drought in 1930it was not until 1884 after the flood of 1882 that the state created the mississippi-yazoo delta district levee board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper delta despite the states building and reinforcing levees for years the great mississippi flood of 1927 broke through and caused massive flooding of 27,000 square miles 70,000km throughout the delta homelessness for hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars in property damages with the depression coming so soon after the flood the state suffered badly during those years in the great migration hundreds of thousands of african americans migrated north and west for jobs and chances to live as full citizensthe legislatures 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the mississippi river and the gulf coast has led to increased revenues and economic gains for

disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites excluding them from politics until the late 1960s it established a one-party state dominated by white democratsin the mid-20th century mississippi white voters together with other southern white voters shifted their allegiance to the republican party first for national and then for state offices but may still vote for democrats at the local level mississippi was the last state to have presidential elections in which one candidate gained a popular vote exceeding 90% and 85% in 1944 and 1964 respectively in both years the voting reflected essentially only white voters in the state as most african americans were overwhelmingly still disenfranchised under the states 1890 constitution and discriminatory practices in 1944 democrat franklin

number of schools and no educational institutions for african americans the first school for black students was not established until 1862during reconstruction in 1871 black and white republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free public education in the state the states dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools in the early 20th century there were still few schools in rural areas particularly for black children with seed money from the julius rosenwald fund many rural black communities across mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children essentially many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities in many cases donating land andor labor to build such schoolsblacks and whites attended segregated and separate public schools in mississippi until the late 1960s although such segregation had been declared unconstitutional by the united states supreme court in its 1954 ruling in brown v board of education in the majority-black mississippi delta counties white parents worked through white citizens councils to set up private segregation academies where they enrolled their children often funding declined for the public schoolsbut in the state as a whole only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools state officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new
