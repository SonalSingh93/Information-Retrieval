job growth the bush campaign portrayed kerry as a staunch liberal who would raise taxes and increase the size of government the bush campaign continuously criticized kerrys seemingly contradictory

us in order to increase public support for his plan for a 1.35trillion tax cut programone of the largest tax cuts in us history bush argued that unspent government funds should be returned to taxpayers saying the surplus is not the governments money the surplus is the peoples money federal reserve chairman alan greenspan warned of a recession and bush stated that a tax cut would stimulate the economy and create jobs treasury secretary paul h oneill opposed some of the tax cuts on the basis that they would contribute to budget deficits and undermine social security oneill disputes the claim made in bushs book decision points that he never openly disagreed with him on planned tax cuts by 2003 the economy showed signs of improvement though job growth remained stagnant another tax cut program was passed that yearduring the 2001 to 2008 years gdp grew at an average annual rate of 2.125percent less than for past business cyclesbush entered office with the dow jones industrial average

accumulated as a result of what became known as the bush tax cuts and increased national security spending in march 2006 then-senator barack obama said when he voted against raising the debt ceiling the fact that we are here today to debate raising americas debt limit is a sign of leadership failure by the end of bushs presidency unemployment climbed to 7.2percentin december 2007 the united states entered the longest postworld war ii recession which included a housing market correction a subprime mortgage crisis soaring oil prices and a declining dollar value in february 63,000 jobs were lost a five-year record to aid with the situation bush signed a 170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses the bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac in 2003 and after two years the regulations passed the house but died in the senate many republican senators as well as influential members of the bush administration feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sectors risky practices in september 2008 the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac followed by the collapse of lehman brothers and a federal bailout of american international group for 85billionmany economists and world governments determined that the situation had become the worst financial crisis since the great depression additional regulation over the housing market would have been beneficial according to former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan bush meanwhile proposed a financial rescue plan to buy back a large portion of the us mortgage market vince reinhardt a former federal reserve economist now at the american enterprise institute said it would have helped for the bush administration to empower the folks at treasury and the federal reserve and the comptroller of the currency and the fdic to look at these issues more closely and additionally that it would have helped for congress to have held hearingsin november 2008 over 500,000 jobs were lost which marked the largest loss of jobs in the united states in 34 years the bureau of labor statistics reported that in the last four months of 2008 1.9million jobs were lost by the end of 2008 the us had lost a total of 2.6million jobsbush undertook a number of educational agendas such as increasing the funding for the national science foundation and national institutes of health in his first years of office and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for american high school students funding for the nih was cut in 2006 the first such cut in 36 years due to rising inflationone of the administrations early major initiatives was the no child left behind act which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools and target more federal funding to low-income schools this landmark education initiative passed with broad bipartisan support including that of senator ted kennedy of massachusetts it was signed into law by bush in early 2002 many contend that the initiative has been successful as cited by the fact that students in the us have performed significantly better on state reading and math tests since bush signed no child left behind into law critics argue that it is underfunded and that nclbas focus on high-stakes testing and quantitative outcomes is counterproductiveafter being re-elected bush signed into law a medicare drug benefit program that according to jan crawford resulted in the greatest expansion in americas welfare state in forty years the bills costs approached 7trillion in 2007 bush opposed and vetoed state childrens health insurance program schip legislation which was added by the democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by congress the schip legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about sixmillion to tenmillion children it was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax bush viewed the legislation as a move toward socialized health care and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as 83,000 per year who did not need the helpfollowing republican efforts to pass the medicare act of 2003 bush signed the bill which included major changes to the medicare program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits the retired persons lobby group aarp worked with the bush administration on the program and gave their endorsement bush said the law estimated to cost 400billion over the first ten years would give the elderly better choices and more control over their health carebush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform social security which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005 bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the us congress in his 2005 state of the union address bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program which included partial privatization of the system personal social security accounts and options to permit americans to divert a portion of their social security tax fica into secured investments democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the systembush embarked on a 60-day national tour campaigning for his initiative in media events known as conversations on social security in an attempt to gain public support nevertheless public support for the proposal declined and the house republican leadership decided not to put social security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda the proposals legislative prospects were further diminished by the fall of 2005 political fallout from hurricane katrina after the democrats gained control of both houses of congress as a result of the 2006 midterm elections there was no prospect of further congressional action on the bush proposal for the remainder of his term in officeupon taking office in 2001 bush stated his opposition to the kyoto protocol an amendment to the united nations framework convention on climate change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions citing that the treaty exempted 80percent of the worlds population and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year he also cited that the senate had voted 950 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocolin may 2001 bush signed an executive order to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects and later signed two other executive orders to tackle environmental issuesin 2002 bush announced the clear skies act of 2003 aimed at amending the clean air act to reduce air pollution through the use of emissions trading programs many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal the initiative was introduced to congress but failed to make it out of committeelater in 2006 bush declared the northwestern hawaiian islands a national monument creating the largest marine reserve to date the papahnaumokukea marine national monument comprises 84million acres 340,000km and is home to 7,000 species of fish birds and other marine animals many of which are specific to only those islands the move was hailed by conservationists for its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible areabush has said that he believes that global warming is real and has noted that it is a serious problem but he asserted there is a debate over whether its man-made or naturally caused the bush administrations stance on global warming remained controversial in the scientific and environmental communities critics have alleged that the administration misinformed the public and did not do enough to reduce carbon emissions and deter global warmingin his 2006 state of the union address bush declared america is addicted to oil and announced his advanced energy initiative to increase energy development researchin his 2007 state of the union address bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing fossil fuel consumption and increasing alternative fuel production amid high gasoline prices in 2008 bush lifted a ban on offshore drilling however the move was largely symbolic because there was still a federal law banning offshore drilling bush said this means that the only thing standing between the american people and these vast oil reserves is action from the us congress bush had said in june 2008 in the long run the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies my administration has worked with congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen fuel cells in the short run the american economy will continue to rely largely on oil and that means we need to increase supply especially here at home so my administration has repeatedly called on congress to expand domestic oil productionin his 2008 state of the union address bush announced that the us would commit 2billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change saying along with contributions from other countries this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner more efficient technologies in developing nations like india and china and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive he also announced plans to reaffirm the united states commitment to work with major economies and through the un to complete an international agreement that will slow stop and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases he stated this agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ridefederal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the department of health and human services and the national institutes of health has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the dickey-wicker amendment by congress and the signature of president bill clinton bush has said that he supports adult stem cell research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research however bush did not support embryonic stem cell research on august 9 2001 bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing lines of stem cells but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned testing can be done on only 12 of the original lines and all approved lines have been cultured in contact with mouse cells which creates safety issues that complicate development and approval of therapies from these lines on july 19 2006 bush used his veto power for the first time in his presidency to veto the stem cell research enhancement act the bill would have repealed the dickey-wicker amendment thereby permitting federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryoon may 21 2008 president george w bush signed into law the genetic information nondiscrimination act gina the bill aims to protect americans against discrimination based on their genetic information when it comes to health insurance and employment the issue had been debated for 13 years before becoming law it is designed to protect citizens while not hindering genetic researchnearly 8million immigrants came to the united states from 2000 to 2005 more than in any other five-year period in the nations history almost half entered illegally in 2006 bush urged congress to allow more than 12million illegal immigrants to work in the united states with the creation of a temporary guest-worker program bush also urged congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 national guard troops to the mexicounited states border from may to june 2007 bush strongly supported the comprehensive immigration reform act of 2007 which was written by a bipartisan group of senators with the active participation of the bush administration the bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants with an eventual path to citizenship establishing a guest worker program a series of border and work site enforcement measures a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based merit system for green cards elimination of chain migration and of the diversity immigrant visa and other measures bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of us laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnestya heated public debate followed which resulted in a substantial rift within the republican party most conservatives opposed it because of its legalization or amnesty provisions the bill was eventually defeated in the senate on june 28 2007 when a cloture motion failed on a 4653 vote bush expressed disappointment upon the defeat of one of his signature domestic initiatives the bush administration later proposed a series of immigration enforcement measures that do not require a change in lawon september 19 2010 former israeli prime minister ehud olmert said that bush offered to accept 100,000 palestinian refugees as american citizens if a permanent settlement had been reached between israel and the palestinian authorityhurricane katrina one of the most damaging natural disasters in us history struck early in bushs second term katrina formed in late august during the 2005 atlantic hurricane season and devastated much of the north-central gulf coast of the united states particularly new orleansbush declared a state of emergency in louisiana on august 27 and in mississippi and alabama the following day he authorized the department of homeland security dhs and federal emergency management agency fema to manage the disaster but his announcement failed to spur these agencies to action the eye of the hurricane made landfall on august 29 and new orleans began to flood due to levee breaches later that day bush declared that a major disaster existed in louisiana officially authorizing fema to start using federal funds to assist in the recovery efforton august 30 dhs secretary michael chertoff declared it an incident of national significance triggering the first use of the newly created national response plan three days later on september 2 national guard troops first entered the city of new orleans the same day bush toured parts of louisiana mississippi and alabama and declared that the success of the recovery effort up to that point was not enoughas the disaster in new orleans intensified critics charged that bush was misrepresenting his administrations role in what they saw as a flawed response leaders attacked bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at fema notably michael d brown it was also argued that the federal response was limited as a result of the iraq war and bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal governments failures in its handling of the emergency it has been argued that with katrina bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recoverduring bushs second term a controversy arose over the justice departments midterm dismissal of seven united states attorneys the white house maintained that the us attorneys were fired for poor performance attorney general alberto gonzales later resigned over the issue along with other senior members of the justice department the house judiciary committee issued subpoenas for advisers harriet miers and josh bolten to testify regarding this matter but bush directed miers and bolten to not comply with those subpoenas invoking his right of executive privilege bush maintained that all of his advisers were protected under a broad executive privilege protection to receive candid advice the justice department determined that the presidents order was legalalthough congressional investigations focused on whether the justice department and the white house were using the us attorney positions for political advantage no official findings have been released on march 10 2008 the congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas on july 31 2008 a united states district court judge ruled that bushs top advisers were not immune from congressional subpoenasin all twelve justice department officials resigned rather than testify under oath before congress they included attorney general alberto gonzales and his chief of staff kyle sampson gonzales liaison to the white house monica goodling aide to the president karl rove and his senior aide sara taylor in addition legal counsel to the president harriet miers and deputy chief of staff to the president joshua bolten were both found in contempt of congressin 2010 the justice department investigator concluded that though political considerations did play a part in as many as four of the attorney firings the firings were inappropriately political but not criminal according to the prosecutors there was insufficient evidence to pursue prosecution for any criminal offensefollowing the resignation of cia director george tenet in 2004 bush nominated porter goss to head the agency the white house ordered goss to purge agency officers who were disloyal to the administration after goss appointment many of the cias senior agents were fired or quit the cia has been accused of deliberately leaking classified information to undermine the 2004 electionin july 2001 bush visited pope john paul ii at castel gandolfo during

terrorism those invasions led to the toppling of the taliban regime in afghanistan and the removal of saddam hussein from power in iraqbush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with european nations he appointed long-time adviser karen hughes to oversee a global public relations campaign bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in georgia and ukrainein march 2006 a visit to india led to renewed ties between the two countries reversing decades of us policy the visit focused particularly on areas of nuclear energy and counter-terrorism cooperation discussions that would lead eventually to the indiaunited states civil nuclear agreementthis is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor clinton whose approach and response to india after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring the relationship between india and the united states was one that dramatically improved during bushs tenuremidway through bushs second term questions arose whether bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda which was highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former soviet republics in central asiain an address before both houses of congress on september 20 2001 bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the september 11 attacks he specifically thanked uk prime minister tony blair for traveling to washington to show unity of purpose with america and said america has no truer friend than great britainthe september 11 terrorist attacks were a major turning point in bushs presidency that evening

i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soonin a september 20 speech bush condemned osama bin laden and his organization al-qaeda and issued an ultimatum to the taliban regime in afghanistan where bin laden was operating to hand over the terrorists or  share in their fateafter september 11 bush announced a global war on terror the afghan taliban regime was not forthcoming with osama bin laden so bush ordered the invasion of afghanistan to overthrow the taliban regime in his january 29 2002 state of the union address he asserted that an axis of evil consisting of north korea iran and iraq was arming to threaten the peace of the world and posed a grave and growing danger the bush administration asserted both a right and the intention to wage preemptive war or preventive war this became the basis for the bush doctrine which weakened the unprecedented levels of international and domestic support for the united states which had followed the september 11 attacksdissent and criticism of bushs leadership in the war on terror increased as the war in iraq continued in 2006 a national intelligence estimate concluded that the iraq war had become the cause clbre for jihadistson october 7 2001 us and british forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of northern alliance troops in kabul on november 13 the main goals of the war were to defeat the taliban drive al-qaeda out of afghanistan and capture key al-qaeda leaders in december 2001 the pentagon reported that the taliban had been defeated but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening taliban and al-qaeda leaders later that month the un had installed the afghan transitional administration chaired by hamid karzai in 2002 based on unicef figures nicholas kristof reported that our invasion of afghanistan may end up saving one million lives over the next decade as the result of improved healthcare and greater access to humanitarian aidefforts to kill or capture al-qaeda leader osama bin laden failed as he escaped a battle in december 2001 in the mountainous region of tora bora which the bush administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough us ground troops it was not until may 2011 two years after bush left office that bin laden was killed by us forces under the obama administration bin ladens successor ayman al-zawahiri remains at largedespite the initial success in driving the taliban from power in kabul by early 2003 the taliban was regrouping amassing new funds and recruits the 2005 failure of operation red wings showed that the taliban had returned in 2006 the taliban insurgency appeared larger fiercer and better organized than expected with large-scale allied offensives such as operation mountain thrust attaining limited success as a result bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in march 2007beginning with his january 29 2002 state of the union address bush began publicly focusing attention on iraq which he labeled as part of an axis of evil allied with terrorists and posing a grave and growing danger to us interests through possession of weapons of mass destructionin the latter half of 2002 cia reports contained assertions of saddam husseins intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs not properly accounting for iraqi biological and chemical weapons and that some iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the un sanctions contentions that the bush administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of iraqs weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the presidentin late 2002 and early 2003 bush urged the united nations to enforce iraqi disarmament mandates precipitating a diplomatic crisis in november 2002 hans blix and mohamed elbaradei led un weapons inspectors in iraq but were advised by the us to depart the country four days prior to the us invasion despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks the us initially sought a un security council resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for un approval due to vigorous opposition from several countriesmore than 20 nations most notably the united kingdom designated the coalition of the willing joined the united states in invading iraq they launched the invasion on march 20 2003 the iraqi military was quickly defeated the capital baghdad fell on april 9 2003 on may 1 bush declared the end of major combat operations in iraq the initial success of us operations increased his popularity but the us and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups bushs mission accomplished speech was later criticized as premature from 2004 until 2007 the situation in iraq deteriorated further with some observers arguing that there was a full-scale civil war in iraq bushs policies met with criticism including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from iraq the 2006 report of the bipartisan iraq study group led by james baker concluded that the situation in iraq was grave and deteriorating while bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of iraq he maintained he would not change the overall iraq strategy according to iraq body count some 251,000 iraqis have been killed in the civil war following the us-led invasion including at least 163,841 civiliansin january 2005 free democratic elections were held in iraq for the first time in 50 years according to iraqi national security advisor mowaffak al-rubaie this is the greatest day in the history of this country bush praised the event as well saying that the iraqis have taken rightful control of their countrys destiny this led to the election of jalal talabani as president and nouri al-maliki as prime minister of iraq a referendum to approve a constitution in iraq was held in october 2005 supported by most shiites and many kurdson january 10 2007 bush announced a surge of 21,500 more troops for iraq as well as a job program for iraqis more reconstruction proposals and 1.2billion for these programs on may 1 2007 bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of us troops saying the debate over the conflict was understandable but insisting that a continued us presence there was crucialin march 2008 bush praised the iraqi governments bold decision to launch the battle of basra against the mahdi army calling it a defining moment in the history of a free iraq he said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding general david petraeus and ambassador ryan crocker about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008 he also praised the iraqis legislative achievements including a pension law a revised de-baathification law a new budget an amnesty law and a provincial powers measure that he said set the stage for the iraqi elections by july 2008 american troop deaths had reached their lowest number since the war began and due to increased stability in iraq bush announced the withdrawal of additional american forcesfollowing the events of september 11 bush issued an executive order authorizing the presidents surveillance program which included allowing the nsa to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the us and parties within the us without obtaining a warrant as required by the foreign intelligence surveillance act as of 2009 the other provisions of the program remained highly classified once the department of justice office of legal counsel questioned its original legal opinion that fisa did not apply in a time of war the program was subsequently re-authorized by the president on the basis that the warrant requirements of fisa were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the authorization for use of military force against terrorists the program proved to be controversial as critics of the administration as well as organizations such as the american bar association argued that it was illegal in august 2006 a us district court judge ruled that the nsa electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional but on july 6 2007 that ruling was vacated by the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked standing on january 17 2007 attorney general alberto gonzales informed us senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the president but would be subjected to judicial oversight later in 2007 the nsa launched a replacement for the program referred to as prism that was subject to the oversight of the united states foreign intelligence surveillance court this program was not publicly revealed until reports by the washington post and the guardian emerged in june 2013bush authorized the cia to use waterboarding and several other enhanced interrogation techniques that several critics including barack obama would label as torture between 2002 and 2003 the cia considered certain enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding to be legal based on a secret justice department legal opinion arguing that terror detainees were not protected by the geneva conventions ban on torture and vice president cheney said enhanced interrogation including waterboarding was not torture or illegal the cia had exercised the technique on certain key terrorist suspects under authority given to it in the bybee memo from the attorney general though that memo was later withdrawn while not permitted by the us army field manuals which assert that harsh interrogation tactics elicit unreliable information the bush administration believed these enhanced interrogations provided critical information to preserve american lives critics such as former cia officer bob baer have stated that information was suspect you can get anyone to confess to anything if the tortures bad enoughon october 17 2006 bush signed into law the military commissions act of 2006 a law enacted in the wake of the supreme courts decision in hamdan v rumsfeld 548 us 557 2006 which allows the us government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial the law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture of detainees but allows the president to determine what constitutes tortureon march 8 2008 bush vetoed hr 2082 a bill that would have expanded congressional oversight over the intelligence community and banned the use of waterboarding as well as other forms of interrogation not permitted under the united states army field manual on human intelligence collector operations saying that the bill congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror in april 2009 the aclu sued and won release of the secret memos that had authorized the bush administrations interrogation tactics one memo detailed specific interrogation tactics including a footnote that described waterboarding as torture as well as that the form of waterboarding used by the cia was far more intense than authorized by the justice departmentbush publicly condemned kim jong-il of north korea naming north korea one of three states in an axis of evil and saying that the united states of america will not permit the worlds most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the worlds most destructive weapons within months both countries had walked away from their respective commitments under the usdprk agreed framework of october 1994 north koreas october 9 2006 detonation of a nuclear device further complicated bushs foreign policy which centered for both terms of his presidency on preventing the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the united states and the world bush condemned north koreas position

to the united states for which north korea would be held accountable on may 7 2007 north korea agreed to shut down its nuclear reactors immediately pending the release of frozen funds held in a foreign bank account this was a result of a series of three-way talks initiated by the united states and including china on september 2 2007 north korea agreed to disclose and dismantle all of its
