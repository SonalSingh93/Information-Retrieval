orbital inclination  wikipedia orbital inclination measures the tilt of an objects orbit around a celestial body it is expressed as the angle between a reference plane and the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting objectfor a satellite orbiting the earth directly above the equator the plane of the satellites orbit is the same as the earths equatorial plane and the satellites orbital inclination is 0 the general case is that the satellites orbit is tilted it spends half an orbit over the northern hemisphere and half over the southern if the orbit swung between 20 north latitude and 20 south latitude then its orbital inclination would be 20the inclination is one of the six orbital elements describing the shape and orientation of a celestial orbit it is the angle between the orbital plane and the plane of reference normally stated in degrees for a satellite orbiting a planet the plane of reference is usually the plane containing the planets equator for planets in the solar system the plane of reference is usually the ecliptic the plane in which the earth orbits the sun this reference plane is most practical for earth-based observers therefore earths inclination is by definition zeroinclination could instead be measured with respect to another plane such as the suns equator or the invariable plane the plane that represents the angular momentum of the solar system approximately the orbital plane of jupitermost planetary orbits in the solar system have relatively small inclinations both in relation to each other and to the suns equatoron the other hand the dwarf planets pluto and eris have inclinations to the ecliptic of 17 and 44 respectively and the large asteroid pallas is inclined at 34the inclination of orbits of natural or artificial satellites is measured relative to the equatorial plane of the body they orbit if they orbit sufficiently closely the equatorial plane is the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the central bodyan inclination of 30 could also be described using an angle of 150 the convention is that the normal orbit is prograde an orbit in the same direction as the planet rotates inclinations greater than 90 describe retrograde orbits thusfor impact-generated moons of terrestrial planets not too far from their star with a large planetmoon distance the orbital planes of moons tend to be aligned with the planets orbit around the star due to tides from the star but if the planetmoon distance is small it may be inclined for gas giants the orbits of moons tend to be aligned with the giant planets equator because these formed in circumplanetary disksthe inclination of exoplanets or members of multiple stars is the angle of the plane of the orbit relative to the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight from earth to the objectsince the word inclination is used in exoplanet studies for this line-of-sight inclination then the angle between the planets orbit and the stars rotation must use a different word and is termed the spin-orbit angle or spin-orbit alignment in most cases the orientation of the stars rotational axis is unknownbecause the radial-velocity method more easily finds planets with orbits closer to edge-on most exoplanets found by this method have inclinations between 45 and 135 although in most cases the inclination is not known consequently most exoplanets found by radial velocity have true masses no more than 40% greater than their minimum masses if the orbit is almost face-on especially for superjovians detected by radial velocity then those objects may actually be brown dwarfs or even red dwarfs one particular example is hd 33636 b which has true mass 142 mj corresponding to an m6v star while its minimum mass was 9.28 mjif the orbit is almost edge-on then the planet can be seen transiting its starfor planets and other rotating celestial bodies the angle of the equatorial plane relative to the orbital plane  such as the tilt of the earths poles toward or away from the sun  is sometimes also called inclination but less ambiguous terms are axial tilt or obliquityin astrodynamics the inclination i can be computed from the orbital momentum vector h or any vector perpendicular to the orbital plane aswhere hz is the z-component of hmutual inclination of two orbits may be calculated from their inclinations to another plane using cosine rule for angles
