2017 pacific hurricane season  wikipedia the 2017 pacific hurricane season is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in which tropical cyclones form in the northeastern pacific ocean the season officially started on may15 in the eastern pacific and on june1 in the central pacific they will both end on november30 these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin however the formation of tropical cyclones is possible at any time of the year this was demonstrated when the first storm tropical storm adrian was named on may10 and became the earliest-known tropical storm in the east pacific since the advent of satellite imagery thus far the season has seen near-average activity in terms of ace in stark contrast to the extremely active seasons in 2014 2015 and 2016 for the third year in a row the season featured above average activity in july with the ace value being the fifth highest for the month however as of november 14 no tropical cyclones have formed in the central pacific if the season ends without a tropical cyclone forming there it would be the first time since 2012 that this happened despite being very active the season featured the weakest storms since the 2013 season with the strongest storm fernanda only dropping to 947 millibarsbeginning this year the national hurricane center has the option to issue advisories and thus allow watches and warnings to be issued on disturbances that are not yet tropical cyclones but have a high chance to become one and are expected to bring tropical storm or hurricane conditions to landmasses within 48hours such systems are classified as potential tropical cyclones advisories on these storms contain the same content including track forecasts and cyclone watches and warnings as advisories on active tropical cyclones this was first demonstrated on august29 with the designation of potential tropical cyclone fourteen-ewhich later developed into tropical storm lidiasouth-southeast of the baja california peninsulaon may25 2017 the national oceanic and atmospheric administration released its annual forecast predicting a 80% chance of a near- to above-average season in both the eastern and central pacific basins with a total of 1420 named storms 611 hurricanes and 37 major hurricanes during may 28 the servicio meteorolgico nacional smn issued its first forecast for the season predicting a total of 16 named storms 10 hurricanes and 6 major hurricanes to developthe accumulated cyclone energy ace for the 2017 pacific hurricane season as of selmas final advisory is 98.0225units 97.09units from the east pacific and 0.9325units from the central pacificalthough the east pacific hurricane season does not officially begin until may15 activity began several days prior with the formation of a tropical depression on may9 this marked the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone in the basin surpassing 1990's hurricane alma it intensified into tropical storm adrian a few hours later marking the earliest formation of a named storm on record near normal activity occurred in june with tropical storm calvin formed on june 11 and hurricane dora on june 25 for the third year in a row july featured above average activity with the fifth highest ace value for that month on record  on may5 the national hurricane center nhc indicated that an area of low pressure was forecast to form south of mexico over subsequent days with the possibility of tropical cyclone development thereafter a broad cyclonic circulation began to develop as expected late on may7 gradually organizing into the seasons first tropical depression by 21:00utc on may9 upon formation at which point it was located about 545mi 875km south-southeast of salina cruz mexico the depression became the earliest-forming east pacific tropical cyclone east of 140w on record the previous record was held by 1990's hurricane alma which formed on may 12 the depression intensified into tropical storm adrian six hours later the earliest-known formation of a named storm in eastern pacific proper since the advent of the satellite era initially forecasts expected the small storm to intensify into a powerful hurricane shortly after reaching peak intensity early on may 10 an unexpected increase in mid-level wind shear caused adrian to quickly weaken back to a tropical depression by 03:00utc on may 11 early on the next day adrian degenerated into a remnant lowa tropical wave emerged off the western coast of africa on may18 and entered the east pacific about a week later where steady organization led to the formation of a tropical depression around 12:00utc on may31 embedded within southwesterly flow around a large upper-level trough across northern mexico the depression moved steadily northeast in a favorable environment and it intensified into tropical storm beatriz by 06:00utc on june1 after attaining peak winds of 45mph 75kmh the system made landfall around 00:00utc on june2 about 25miles 40km west of puerto ngel the mountainous terrain of mexico quickly disrupted beatriz and it ultimately dissipated twelve hours laterin the state of oaxaca flights out of bahas de huatulco international airport were cancelled and schools were closed until at least june3 dozens of roads were rendered impassable due to mudslides and flooding numerous locales received over 4in 102mm of rain with a storm total of 19.07in 484.4mm in huatulco numerous landslides caused significant disruption across the state especially by blocking federal highway 200 at many areas a landslide in san marcial ozolotepec killed two girls and buried several houses while another in san carlos yautepec killed a woman as of june 4 a total of seven people have been killedfive in oaxaca and two in tehuantepec less than two weeks after beatriz tropical storm calvin affected similar areas of mexico and inflicted additional damage combined damage from the two systems reached at least 70million pesos us3.9million in oaxacain the second week of june the nhc forecast the development of a broad area of low pressure a few hundred miles south of mexico over the next several days this prediction came to fruition on june9 and the fledgling disturbance steadily organized into a tropical depression by 12:00utc on june11 while located about 150mi 240km south-southeast of salina cruz it was slow to organize initially amid moderate easterly wind shear as it drifted northwestwards by 18:00utc on june12 however the tropical depression intensified into tropical storm calvin intensifying slightly to reach winds of 45mph 75kmh calvin made landfall halfway between salina cruz and puerto ngel near paja blanca around 00:00utc on june13 just 12hours later calvin dissipated into a remnant low the remnants of the storm caused heavy rainfall and some flooding in the area however no fatalities were reportedon june21 the nhc began monitoring a broad area of low pressure south of the gulf of tehuantepec for possible tropical cyclogenesis the disturbance organized into a tropical depression by 03:00utc on june25 and became a tropical storm six hours later receiving the name dora progressing in a west-northwesterly direction at a steady speed the storm began a 30-hour period of rapid intensification and became the first hurricane of the season at 09:00 utc on june 26 with impressive upper-level outflow and an eye apparent on satellite imagery the storm attained peak winds of 90mph 150kmh by late on june26 dora maintained its intensity for a number of hours before beginning to rapidly weaken over cooler sea surface temperatures and in an environment of drier air the storm later degenerated into a remnant low early on june 28 after all of the storms deep convection had dissipatedthe outer bands of dora brought heavy rains to guerrero resulting in flash floods that inundated 20homes overall damage was minor howeverhurricane eugene developed from a disturbance located 765mi 1,230km south of the southern tip of the baja california peninsula on july 7 on the following day eugene underwent a period of rapid intensification in an 18-hour period starting at 21:00utc on july8 eugene intensified from a tropical storm with 70mph 110kmh winds to a category3 hurricane with 115mph 185kmh winds making it the first major hurricane of the season however by 12 hours later the entrainment of dry air caused eugene to weaken to a category2 hurricane and due to traveling over cooler waters eugene weakened to a tropical storm on the following day as the coverage of deep convection steadily dwindled eugene fell to tropical depression intensity around 15:00utc on july12 and degenerated to a remnant low six hours laterdangerous rip currents combined with swells of 4 to 8ft 1.2 to 2.4m across southern california resulted in hundreds of rescues on july10 alone lifeguards in huntington beach made 200rescues while 600 were made in los angeles county lifeguards also responded to 700medical emergencieslate on july10 the nhc began monitoring a broad area of low pressure several hundred miles southwest of manzanillo contrary to predictions of gradual development the disturbance rapidly organized into a tropical depression by 03:00utc on july12 and further strengthened to become tropical storm fernanda around 15:00utc that day the nascent cyclone initially battled moderate northeasterly wind shear with its low-level circulation displaced to the northeastern edge of the deep convection this period of unfavorable upper-level winds was short-lived and soon afterwards fernanda commenced a period of rapid intensification intensifying into a hurricane at 21:00utc on july13 a well-defined eye formed within a growing central dense overcast and fernanda further intensified into a major hurricane early on july 14 only six hours later the system was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane at 10.9n fernanda became the second strongest hurricane to occur at such a low latitude in the eastern pacific only behind 2015's hurricane olafwith expansive upper-level outflow and spiral bands a distinct eye and a symmetric central dense overcast fernanda attained peak winds of 145mph 230kmh around 03:00utc on july15 a series of microwave passes around that time began to indicate the formation of a secondary eyewall that halted the cyclones development as it tracked west-northwest to northwest the eyewall replacement cycle concluded early on july16 allowing fernanda to remain a powerful hurricane amid favorable environmental conditions by late on july18 however cooler ocean temperatures and a more stable environment prompted the storms weakening trend fernanda fell below hurricane intensity shortly before entering the central pacific as it succumbed to stronger southwesterly wind shear and after failing to produce sustained deep convection degenerated to a remnant low about 500miles 805km east of hilo hawaii by 21:00utc on july22on july12 the nhc forecast the formation of a broad area of low pressure south of mexico over subsequent days the disturbance formed two days later and slowly organized into a tropical depression by 15:00utc on july17 the tropical cyclone battled strong west-northwesterly wind shear after formation intensifying into tropical storm greg by 09:00utc on july18 as deep convection burst near the center however the storm remained in a steady state for several days thereafter despite continued predictions of intensification ultimately given global models poor handling of the environment nhc lowered their intensity forecast for greg the cyclone continued west for the remainder of its life and maintained a similar convective structure with intermittent bursts of deep convection near the center approaching the central pacific gregs low-level circulation became increasingly difficult to locate as it moved into a cooler drier environment intertwined by increasing southerly wind shear and the system weakened to a tropical depression around 21:00utc on july25 it degenerated to a remnant low 24 hours latera low-pressure trough began producing disorganized convection over the waters of the pacific ocean well to the south of baja california peninsula on july14 despite only marginally conducive environmental conditions the disturbance began to show signs of organization two days later and it attained tropical depression status by 15:00utc on july18 strong west-northwesterly wind shear confined the storms intermittent bursts of convection well to the southwest of its low-level circulation and the depression consequently failed to produce winds above 35mph 55kmh the systems center later degenerated into a low-pressure trough within the intertropical convergence zone prompting the nhc to discontinue advisories at 21:00utc on july20part of an exceptionally active july the nhc began highlighting the far eastern reaches of the pacific basin on july19 for tropical development in later days a large area of disturbed weather progressed westward across costa rica later that day steadily organizing into a tropical depression by 15:00utc on july21 the cyclone failed to organize immediately after formation and its low-level center migrated to the southern extent of associated convection by 03:00utc on july23 though better defined banding features and a more organized convective structure led the nhc to designate the system as tropical storm hilary over the coming hours the cyclones convective structure evolved into a small central dense overcast while hints of an eye became apparent in accordance with satellite estimates hilary was upgraded to a hurricane at 09:00utc on july24 a moist environment and warm ocean waters propelled hilary to its peak as a category2 hurricane with winds of 105mph 165kmh 24 hours later at which time its core was most symmetric after maintaining its intensity the hurricane began to weaken late on july26 as northerly wind shear increased it fell back to tropical storm intensity around 03:00utc on july27 and ultimately degenerated to a remnant low four days lateron july16 the nhc highlighted the expected formation of an area of low pressure south of mexico later that week a tropical wave began producing disorganized cloudiness three days later and the broad system slowly organized into a tropical depression by 15:00utc on july22 its structure changed little after formation impinged by strong wind shear despite this satellite wind data indicated the cyclone intensified into tropical storm irwin by 09:00utc on july23 over the next 24 hours deep convection began to wrap around the center and a mid-level eye formed as environmental conditions improved by 09:00utc on july25 irwin intensified into a hurricane although coolest cloudtops were located in the western semicircle of the system a well-defined eye and convection in the eyewall propelled irwin to its peak with winds of 90mph 150kmh late on july25 almost immediately outflow from nearby hurricane hilary increased wind shear over the system and caused it to begin weakening irwin rapidly fell to tropical storm strength around 15:00utc on july26 contrary to projections of continued weakening however the storms cloud pattern maintained or even improved over subsequent days as it passed over marginal ocean temperatures finally after losing its deep convection and being reduced to a swirl of low-level clouds irwin was declared a remnant low around 21:00utc on august1on july28 the nhc advertised the likely development of an area of low pressure well south of mexico over subsequent days an area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms associated with a tropical wave materialized three days later but little change occurred thereafter early on august3 a surface circulation formed in association with concentrating convection and this process led to the formation of a tropical depression by 15:00utc the next day the newly formed cyclone did not intensify after designation and its low- and mid-level circulations separated by over 265mi 425km on august5 falling short of the tropical cyclone criteria the short-lived depression was declared a remnant low at 21:00utc that daythe nhc began monitoring a strong tropical wave over the eastern caribbean on august3 the feature pushed westward developing into hurricane franklin before making landfall on the yucatn and attaining its peak as a category1 hurricane before making landfall near vega de alatorre veracruz on august10 although its low-level circulation dissipated the nhc in days prior noted the potential for franklins mid-level remnants to reform in the east pacific the remnants of franklin induced a surface low off the coast of southwestern mexico on august11 and steady organization led to the formation of tropical storm jova by 03:00utc the next day on a westward course jova was plagued by strong wind shear from an area of high pressure over northwestern mexico with a very disorganized appearance on satellite after lacking sufficient organization to be declared a tropical cyclone the storm was declared a remnant low around 03:00utc on august14on august12 the nhc noted the potential for an area of low pressure to form well south of baja california peninsula during the following days a large area of disturbed weather developed two days later as predicted however organization was slow to occur and a tropical depression only formed four days later around 15:00utc on august18 the newly formed cyclone embarked on a west to west-northwest course intensifying into tropical storm kenneth early on august19 and further into a hurricane by 15:00utc on august20 despite forecasts of only slight additional intensification kenneth rapidly intensified with the eye feature warming dramatically and the surrounding cloud tops cooling the cyclone attained major hurricane strength around 03:00utc on august21 and six hours later reached its peak as a category4 hurricane with sustained winds of 130mph 215kmh progressively cooler sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear caused kenneth to steadily weaken following the intensification trend with its inner core eroding and low-level circulation becoming displaced by 21:00utc on august22 the storm weakened below hurricane strength the following day at 21:00 utc kenneth was declared post-tropicalon august 29 the nhc monitored a potential area of tropical cyclone development near the coast of baja california with tropical storm watches and hurricane watches stretching from todos santos to los barriles on september 8 hurricane katia of the atlantic made landfall on mexico dissipating on september 9 however its mid-level circulation survived and eventually spawned an area of low pressure off the coast of mexico on september 11 the system organized into tropical depression fifteen-e during the next several days the depression slowly drifted westward before strengthening into tropical storm otis on september 16 while only marginal strengthening was forecast otis unexpectedly rapidly intensified into a category 2 hurricane by 17:00 utc on september 17 despite lower ocean temperatures drier air and increased wind shear otis continued to intensify into a category 3 major hurricane by 03:00 utc on september 18 developing a well-defined eye with a diameter of 10 nautical miles 12mi 19km by 21:00 utc on september 18 otis had rapidly degenerated back into a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 40 knots 46mph 74kmh twelve hours after developing a well-defined eye otis started weakening at a remarkable rate losing most of its deep convection from low ocean surface temperatures until it became a remnant low on september 19 due to a lack of convectionon september9 the nhc mentioned the possibility for an area of low pressure to form south of mexico over later days a trough of low pressure materialized the next day steadily organizing into a tropical depression near the southwestern coast of mexico around 15:00utc on september13 despite forecasts of little or no intensification the newly formed cyclone intensified into tropical storm max six hours later quick intensification ensued as the storm improved in structure and developed a well-defined eye prompting the nhc to upgrade max to a hurricane around 12:00utc on september14 after attaining peak winds of 85mph 140kmh the hurricane moved ashore the coastline of guerrero at a slightly reduced strength around 21:00utc the mountainous terrain of inland mexico severely disrupted maxs circulation causing it to degenerate by 09:00utc on september15in preparation for max about 788 people evacuated to temporary shelters throughout guerrero over 1,500 homes were inundated by floodwaters or damaged by strong winds that ripped off roofs over 100 trees were downed mudslides and sinkholes closed several roads including mexican federal highway 200 and telephone service was cut at the height of the storm 126,503 comisin federal de electricidad customers lost electricity a bridge between cruz grande and copala was severely damaged and access to juchitn de zaragoza was severed due to a flooded highway one of 17 rapidly-rising rivers swept away a residence and two neighbors who attempted to rescue the homeowner one of the neighbors died constituting one of two deaths attributed to the storm at least 3,000 residents across five municipalities in guerrero were stranded waves of 1016ft 35m battered the coastline where six ships were sunkon september 10 the nhc started to monitor an area of low pressure well south of manzanillo mexico the disturbance gradually organized during the following days and by 09:00utc on september14 the system was noted to develop a well-defined center and spiral banding this led to the formation of tropical storm norma skipping tropical depression status the newly formed tropical storm continued to intensify at a steady pace while it moved slowly northward becoming a category 1 hurricane by 03:00utc on september16 and reaching winds of 75mph 120kmh at this time warnings were being required for the southern portions of the baja california peninsula as norma was forecast to become a major hurricane and make landfall in the area however its broad circulation and the entrainment of dry air quickly became an impediment in doing so norma then weakened back to a tropical storm at 21:00utc later that day while becoming stationary though a developing ridge over mexico began to move the storm slowly towards the north norma maintained its intensity the next day and continued being slowly steered by the ridge towards a northwesterly to west-northwesterly path all tropical storm warnings were discontinued as norma started to shift its track more to the west the cyclone continued weakening for several days as it slowly drifted to the west until finally being declared a remnant low at 03:00utc on september20during the week of september 18 the nhc began monitoring a tropical wave as it spawned a broad area of low pressure located offshore of the southwestern coast of mexico the disturbance lacked any significant organization until september 23 at around 21:00utc when the system was noted to developed surface winds of over 35mph 55kmh becoming tropical depression eighteen-e the depression organized into a tropical storm six hours later and was given the name pilar the sixteenth named storm of the annual pacific hurricane season thereafter despite having a disorganized appearance on satellite pilars winds increased in strength and it reached its peak with sustained winds of 45mph 75kmh by 09:00utc on september 24 pilar continued to track north along the coast with warnings being issued for the southwestern coast of mexico however early on september 25 these warnings were discontinued as tropical storm pilar showed signs of weakening mainly due to land interaction and was reduced to a tropical depression before ultimately dissipating at around 21:00utc later that same day although pilar did not make landfall as a tropical cyclone heavy rainfall was reported in puerto vallarta mexico northeast of islas maras and in other areas along the mexican coastlineon october 3 the nhc noted a high chance of tropical development in an area of low pressure to the south of mexico the system increased in intensity and became tropical storm ramon early on october 4 skipping tropical depression status due to wind shear from a large anticyclone to its north the storm did not intensify much further although it was forecast to linger over open waters as it moved westward this did not occur and the system quickly grew disorganized ramon weakened into a tropical depression later on the same day having lasted as a tropical storm only for 18 hours as it moved westward ramon continued to weaken until it finally degenerated into a trough of low pressure on october 5 and the national hurricane center issued its last advisory on the degenerated system at 09:00utc on the same daylate on october24 the nhc began to monitor the formation of an area of low pressure located south of eastern central america the system quickly gained organization as it moved northwestwards and was declared tropical storm selma at 09:00utc on october27 this marked only the second time that an eastern pacific tropical cyclone became a tropical storm east of 90w the other being alma of 2008 with the environment thought to be generally conducive to intensification selma was forecast to gain some strength before moving northwards into central america however with wind shear stronger than expected this did not materialize and selma never strengthened beyond minimal tropical storm status eventually at 12:00utc on october28 selma made landfall just southeast of san salvador el salvador becoming the first eastern pacific tropical cyclone to make landfall anywhere in el salvador once over land selma weakened quickly and degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone by 21:00utc on october28 selmas remnant dissipated overland within the next several hoursheavy rains produced by selma and a cold front resulted in flooding that killed seven people in honduras dozens of landslides damaged homes and blocked roadways while 13rivers topped their banks approximately 38,000people required evacuation and more than 3,000homes were flooded as 13rivers topped their banks rainfall extended into nicaragua causing floods that claimed another 10lives in areas recovering from tropical storm natethe following names will be used for named storms that form in the northeastern pacific ocean during 2017 retired names if any will be announced by the world meteorological organization in the spring of 2018 the names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2023 season this same list was used in the 2011 seasonfor storms that form in the central pacific hurricane centers area of responsibility encompassing the area between 140 degrees west and the international date line all names are used in a series of four rotating lists the next four names slated for use are shown belowthe usage of the atlantic storm name don and the name hilary in july garnered some negative attention relating to united states president donald trump and former presidential candidate hillary clinton people also took to twitter to poke fun at the names and both individuals with political jokesthis is a table
