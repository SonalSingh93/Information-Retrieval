the open atlantic on september 21 it continued westward affecting the lesser antilles as a tropical storm then entered the caribbean as it moved west the storm dissipated while being affected by wind shear south of cuba and regenerated when the vertical wind shear weakened it turned to the northwest and strengthened up to category 2 strength on october 1 lili made two landfalls in western cuba later that day and then entered the gulf of mexico the hurricane rapidly strengthened on october 2 reaching category4 strength that afternoon it weakened rapidly thereafter and hit louisiana as a

existencea tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on september 16 a low level center of circulation developed from a tropical disturbance spawned by this tropical wave midway between the african coast and the caribbean on september 20 the next day the system gained sufficient organization to become a tropical depression the depression moved westward in excess of 20mph 32kmh and reached tropical storm strength-becoming tropical storm lili as it passed through the windward islands the cyclone continued to intensify as it moved west through the caribbean sea reaching a peak strength of 70mph 110kmh on the morning of september 24 this was immediately followed by an abrupt weakening and the storms maximum sustained winds dropped to 40mph 64kmh later that day the sudden weakening was attributed to strong southerly vertical shear the system degenerated into an open tropical wave the next morning and remained in that state for nearly two dayslili regenerated near jamaica on the evening of september 26 and gradually turned more to the west-northwest while strengthening the system became a hurricane on september 30 just after passing through the cayman islands

with winds of 145mph 233kmh during that afternoonthis strength was not maintained for long the storm began to quickly weaken in the early morning hours of october 3 and this rapid weakening continued until the hurricanes final landfall near intracoastal city louisiana due to a combination of vertical wind shear cool waters just offshore louisiana and slowly encroaching dry air within its southwest quadrant by the time of landfall maximum sustained winds had dropped to 90mph 145kmh the weakening was accompanied by a collapse of the inner eyewall before landfall the system continued inland

great environmental damage to the marshes and barrier islands in louisiana huge fish kills were observed in marshes near the landfall point and in the atchafalaya swamp the barrier islands to the east of the landfall point those subjected to the highest surge were severely eroded sand was also deposited behind them into the brackish marshes burying vegetation the freshwater marshes were severely damaged by the wind and surge some of them completely destroyed the severe erosion created new waterways connecting inland bodies of water with the gulf of mexico which eventually led to further erosion of inland lagoonsthe name lili was retired in the spring of 2003 because of its destruction and deadly caribbean track and will never be used again in the atlantic basin it was replaced with laura for the 2008 season the names lucy and lisette were also suggested as possible replacement names for lili
