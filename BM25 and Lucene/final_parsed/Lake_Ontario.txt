lake ontario  wikipedia lake ontario is one of the five great lakes of north america it is surrounded on the north west and southwest by the canadian province of ontario and on the south and east by the american state of new york whose water boundaries meet in the middle of the lake ontario canadas most populous province was named for the lake in the huron language the name ontario means lake of shining waters its primary inlet is the niagara river from lake erie the last in the great lakes chain lake ontario serves as the outlet to the atlantic ocean via the saint lawrence riverlake ontario is the easternmost of the great lakes and the smallest in surface area 7,340sqmi 18,960km although it exceeds lake erie in volume 393 cumi 1,639km it is the 14th largest lake in the world when its islands are included the lake has a shoreline that is 712 miles 1,146km long as the last lake in the great lakes hydrologic chain lake ontario has the lowest mean surface elevation of the lakes at 243 feet 74m above sea level 326 feet 99m lower than its neighbor upstream its maximum length is 193 statute miles 311 kilometres 168 nautical miles and its maximum width is 53 statute miles 85km 46nmi the lakes average depth is 47 fathoms 1 foot 283ft 86 m with a maximum depth of 133 fathoms 4 feet 802ft 244 m the lakes primary source is the niagara river draining lake erie with the st lawrence river serving as the outlet the drainage basin covers 24,720squaremiles 64,030km as with all the great lakes water levels change both within the year owing to seasonal changes in water input and among years owing to longer term trends in precipitation these water level fluctuations are an integral part of lake ecology and produce and maintain extensive wetlands the lake also has an important freshwater fishery although it has been negatively affected by factors including over-fishing water pollution and invasive speciesbaymouth bars built by prevailing winds and currents have created a significant number of lagoons and sheltered harbors mostly near but not limited to prince edward county ontario and the easternmost shores perhaps the best-known example is toronto bay chosen as the site of the upper canada ontario capital for its strategic harbour other prominent examples include hamilton harbour irondequoit bay presquile bay and sodus bay the bars themselves are the sites of long beaches such as sandbanks provincial park and sandy island beach state park these sand bars are often associated with large wetlands which support large numbers of plant and animal species as well as providing important rest areas for migratory birds presquile on the north shore of lake ontario is particularly significant in this regard one unique feature of the lake is the z-shaped bay of quinte which separates prince edward county from the ontario mainland save for a 2-mile 3.2km isthmus near trenton this feature also supports many wetlands and aquatic plants as well as associated fisheriesmajor rivers draining into lake ontario include the niagara river don river humber river trent river cataraqui river genesee river oswego river black river little salmon river and the salmon riverthe lake basin was carved out of soft weak silurian-age rocks by the wisconsin ice sheet during the last ice age the action of the ice occurred along the pre-glacial ontarian river valley which had approximately the same orientation as todays basin material that was pushed southward by the ice sheet left landforms such as drumlins kames and moraines both on the modern land surface and the lake bottom reorganizing the regions entire drainage system as the ice sheet retreated toward the north it still dammed the st lawrence valley outlet so that the lake surface was at a higher level this stage is known as lake iroquois during that time the lake drained through present-day syracuse new york into the mohawk river thence to the hudson river and the atlantic the shoreline created during this stage can be easily recognized by the now dry beaches and wave-cut hills 10 to 25 miles 15 to 40km from the present shorelinewhen the ice finally receded from the st lawrence valley the outlet was below sea level and for a short time the lake became a bay of the atlantic ocean in association with the champlain sea gradually the land rebounded from the release of the weight of about 6,500 feet 2,000m of ice that had been stacked on it it is still rebounding about 12inches 30cm per century in the st lawrence area since the ice receded from the area last the most rapid rebound still occurs there this means that the lake bed is gradually tilting southward inundating the south shore and turning river valleys into bays both north and south shores experience shoreline erosion but the tilting amplifies this effect on the south shore causing loss to property ownersthe name ontario is derived from the huron word ontario which means great lake the lake was a border between the huron people and the iroquois confederacy in the pre-columbian era in the 1600s the iroquois drove out the huron from southern ontario and settled the northern shores of lake ontario when the iroquois withdrew and the anishnabeg  ojibwa  mississaugas moved in from the north to southern ontario they retained the iroquois nameit is believed that the first european to reach the lake was tienne brl in 1615 as was their practice the french explorers introduced other names for the lake in 1632 and 1656 the lake was referred to as lac de st louis or lake st louis by samuel de champlain and cartographer nicolas sanson respectively likely for louis xiv of france in 1660 jesuit historian francis creuxius coined the name lacus ontarius in a map drawn in the relation des jsuites 16621663 the lake bears the legend lac ontario ou des iroquois with the name ondiara in smaller type a french map produced in 1712 currently in the canadian museum of history created by military engineer jean-baptiste de couagne identified lake ontario as lac frontenac named after louis de buade comte de frontenac et de palluau he was a french soldier courtier and governor general of new france from 1672 to 1682 and from 1689 to his death in 1698artifacts which are believed to be of norse origin have been found in the area of sodus bay indicating the possibility of trading by the indigenous peoples with norse explorers on the east coast of north americaa series of trading posts were established by both the british and french such as fort frontenac kingston in 1673 fort oswego in 1722 fort rouill toronto in 1750 after the french and indian war all forts around the lake were under british control the united states did not take possession of forts on present-day american territory until the signing of the jay treaty in 1794 permanent non-military european settlement began during the american revolution as the easternmost and nearest lake to the atlantic seaboard of canada and the united states population centres here are among the oldest in the great lakes basin with kingston ontario formerly the capital of canada dating to the 1670s fort frontenac the lake became a hub of commercial activity following the war of 1812 with canal building on both sides of the border and heavy travel by lake steamers steamer activity peaked in the mid-19th century before competition from railway linesin the late 19th and early 20th centuries a type of scow known as a stone hooker was in operation on the north-west shore particularly around port credit and bronte stonehooking was the practice of raking flat fragments of dundas shale from the shallow lake floor of the area for use in construction particularly in the growing city of torontothe great lakes watershed is a region of high biodiversity and lake ontario is important for its diversity of birds fish reptiles amphibians and plants many of these special species are associated with shorelines particularly sand dunes lagoons and wetlands the importance of wetlands to the lake has been appreciated and many of the larger wetlands have protected status however these wetlands are changing in part because the natural water level fluctuations have been reduced many wetland plants are dependent upon low water levels to reproduce when water levels are stabilized the area and diversity of the marsh is reduced this is particularly true of meadow marsh also known as wet meadow wetlands for example in eel bay near alexandria bay regulation of lake levels has resulted in large losses of wet meadow often this is accompanied by the invasion of cattails which displace many of the native plant species and reduce plant diversity eutrophication may accelerate this process by providing nitrogen and phosphorus for the more rapid growth of competitively dominant plants similar effects are occurring on the north shore in wetlands such as presquile which have interdunal wetlands called pannes with high plant diversity and many unusual plant speciesmost of the forests around the lake are deciduous forests dominated by trees including maple oak beech ash and basswood these are classified as part of the mixedwood plains ecozone by environment canada or as the eastern great lakes and hudson lowlands by the united states environmental protection agency or as the great lakes ecoregion by the nature conservancy deforestation in the vicinity of the lake has had many negative impacts including loss of forest birds extinction of native salmon and increased amounts of sediment flowing into the lake in some areas more than 90 percent of the forest cover has been removed and replaced by agriculture certain tree species such as hemlock have also been particularly depleted by past logging activity guidelines for restoration stress the importance of maintaining and restoring forest cover particularly along streams and wetlandsthe open water is less-affected by shoreline features such as wetlands and more affected by nutrient levels that control the production of algae algae are the basis of the open water food web and the source of primary production that ends up as lake trout and walleye at the top of the open water food weblike the other great lakes lake ontario used to have an important commercial fishery it has been largely destroyed mostly by over-fishing consider the lake sturgeon as but one example lake sturgeon are huge fishthey can grow up to three meters long and exceed 190kg in weight the females mature slowly and require decades to reach sexual maturity it was once an abundant species in lake ontario in 1860 this species taken on incidental catches of other fishes was killed and dumped back in the lake piled up on shore to dry and be burned fed to pigs or dug into the earth as fertilizer it was even stacked like cordwood and used to fuel steamboats once its value was realized they were taken by every available means from spearing and jigging to set lines of baited or unbaited hooks laid on the bottom to trapnets poundnets and gillnets over 5 million pounds were taken from adjoining lake erie in a single year the fishery collapsed largely by 1900 they have never recovered like most sturgeons the lake sturgeon is rare now and is protected in many areas populations in the oswego river are being actively managed for recoverythis food web has been damaged not only by over-fishing and changes in nutrient levels but also by other types of pollution from industrial chemicals agricultural fertilizers untreated sewage phosphates from laundry detergents and pesticides some pollutant chemicals that have been found in the lake include ddt benzoapyrene and other pesticides pcbs aramite chromium lead mirex mercury and carbon tetrachloride the international joint commission has identified areas where pollution is particularly intense point sources and mapped them as areas of concern a remedial action plan has been developed for each area some lake ontario areas of concern include the oswego river and rochester embayment on the american side and hamilton harbour and toronto on the canadian sideby the 1960s and 1970s the increased pollution caused frequent algal blooms to occur in the summer these blooms killed large numbers of fish and left decomposing piles of filamentous algae and dead fish along the shores at times the blooms became so thick that waves could not break fish eating birds such as osprey bald eagle and cormorant were being poisoned by contaminated fish since the 1960s and 1970s environmental concerns have forced a cleanup of industrial and municipal wastes cleanup has been accomplished through better treatment plants tighter environmental regulations deindustrialization and increased public awareness today lake ontario has recovered some of its pristine quality for example walleye a fish species considered as a marker of clean water are now found however regional airshed pollution remains a concern the lake has also become an important sport fishery although with introduced species coho and chinook salmon rather than the native species bald eagle and osprey populations are also beginning to recoverinvasive species are a problem for lake ontario particularly lamprey and zebra mussels lamprey are being controlled by poisoning in the juvenile stage in the streams where they breed zebra mussels in particular are difficult to control and pose major challenges for the lake and its waterwaysthe lake has a natural seiche rhythm of eleven minutes the seiche effect normally is only about  inches 2cm but can be greatly amplified by earth movement winds and atmospheric pressure changesbecause of its great depth the lake as a whole never freezes in winter but an ice sheet covering between 10% and 90% of the lake area typically develops depending on the severity of the winter ice sheets typically form along the shoreline and in slack water bays where the lake is not as deep during the winters of 1877 and 1878 the ice sheet coverage was up to 95100% in most of the lake in the winter of 1812 the ice cover was stable enough that the american naval commander stationed at sackets harbor feared a british attack from kingston over the icewhen the cold winds of winter pass over the warmer water of the lake they pick up moisture and drop it as lake-effect snow since the prevailing winter winds are from the northwest the southern and southeastern shoreline of the lake is referred to as the snowbelt in some winters the area between oswego and pulaski may receive twenty or more feet 600cm of snowfall also impacted by lake-effect snow is the tug hill plateau an area of elevated land that is about 20 miles 32km east of lake ontario creating ideal conditions for lake-effect snowfall the hill as it is often referred to typically receives more snow than any other region in the eastern united states as a result tug hill is a popular location for winter enthusiasts such as snow-mobilers and cross-country skiers lake-effect snow often extends inland as far as syracuse with that city often recording the most winter snowfall accumulation of any large city in the united states other cities in the world receive more snow annually such as quebec city which averages 135 inches 340cm and sapporo japan which receives 250 inches 640cm each year and is often regarded as the snowiest city in the world foggy conditions particularly in fall can be created by thermal contrasts and can be an impediment for recreational boaters in a normal winter lake ontario will be at most one quarter ice-covered in a mild winter almost completely unfrozen lake ontario has completely frozen over on five recorded occasions from about january 20 to about march 20 1830 in 1874 in 1893 in 1912 and in february 1934lake breezes in spring tend to retard fruit bloom until the frost danger is past and in the autumn delay the onset of fall frost particularly on the south shore cool onshore winds also retard early bloom of plants and flowers until later in the spring season protecting them from possible frost damage such microclimatic effects have enabled tender fruit production in a continental climate with the southwest shore supporting a major fruit-growing area apples cherries pears plums and peaches are grown in many commercial orchards around rochester between stoney creek and niagara-on-the-lake on the niagara peninsula is a major fruit-growing and wine-making area the wine-growing region extends over the international border into niagara and orleans counties apple varieties that tolerate a more extreme climate are grown on the lakes north shore around cobourga large conurbation called the golden horseshoe occupies the lakes westernmost shores anchored by the cities of toronto and hamilton ports on the canadian side include st catharines oshawa cobourg and kingston near the st lawrence river outlet close to 9 million people or over a quarter of canadas population lives within the watershed of lake ontario the american shore is largely rural with the exception of rochester and the much smaller ports at oswego and sackets harbor the city of syracuse is 40 miles 64km inland connected to the lake by the new york state canal system over 2 million people live in lake ontarios american watersheda high-speed passengervehicle ferry the

headland and the lakes outlet at kingston the toronto islands on the north-western shore are the remnants of a sand spit formed by coastal erosion whereas the mostly larger eastern islands are underlain by the basement rock found throughout the region wolfe island located near kingston at the st lawrence outlet is the largest island in the basin it is accessible by ferry from both canada and the usthe great lakes circle tour and seaway trail are designated scenic road systems connecting all of the great lakes and the st lawrence river as the seaway trail is posted on the us side only lake ontario is the only of the five great lakes to have no posted bi-national circle tourin the 1800s there were reports of an alleged creature similar to the so-called loch ness monster being sighted in the lake the creature is described as large with a long neck green in colour and generally causes a break in the surface wavesas of 2012 nearly 50 people have successfully swum across the lake the first person who accomplished the feat was marilyn bell who did it in 1954 at the age of 16 torontos marilyn bell park is named in her honour the park opened in 1984 and is located just to the east of the spot where bell completed her swim in 1974 diana nyad became the first person who swam across the lake against the current from north to south on august 28 2007 14-year-old natalie lambert from kingston ontario made the swim leaving sackets harbor new york and reaching kingstons confederation basin less than 24 hours after she entered the lake on august 19 2012 14-year-old
