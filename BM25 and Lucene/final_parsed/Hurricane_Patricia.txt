hurricane patricia  wikipedia hurricane patricia was the second-most intense tropical cyclone on record worldwide behind typhoon tip in 1979 with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 872mbar hpa 25.75inhg originating from a sprawling disturbance near the gulf of tehuantepec south of mexico in mid-october2015 patricia was first classified a tropical depression on october20 initial development was slow with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification the system later became a tropical storm and was named patricia the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on october22 a well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and patricia grew from a tropical storm to a category5 hurricane in just 24hoursa near-record pace on october23 the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215mph 345kmh this made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the western hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of 1-minute maximum sustained windslate on october23 dramatic weakening ensued and patricia made landfall near cuixmala jalisco with winds of 150mph 240kmh this made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the pacific coast of mexico patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly faster than it had intensified as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of mexico within 24hours of moving ashore patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter late on october24the precursor to patricia produced widespread flooding rains in central america hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the storm mostly in guatemala at least six fatalities were attributed to the event four in el salvador one in guatemala and one in nicaragua torrential rains extended into southeastern mexico with areas of quintana roo and veracruz reporting accumulations in excess of 19.7in 500mm damage in chetumal reached 1.4billion pesos us84.1millionas a tropical cyclone patricias effects in mexico were tremendous however the affected areas were predominantly rural mitigating a potential large-scale disaster violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed seven fatalities were linked to the hurricane directly or indirectly including one during evacuations total damage was estimated to be in excess of 5.4billion pesos us323.3million with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from patricia inflicted us52.5million in damage across southern texason october11 2015 an area of disturbed weather traversed central america and emerged over the eastern pacific ocean the disturbance moved slowly over the next few days later merging with a tropical wave on october15 the merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure this feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00utc on october20 at this time the depression was situated roughly 205mi 335km south-southeast of salina cruz mexico a mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing pathdevelopment was initially slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air and the depression became tropical storm patricia later that day once clear of the unfavorable region patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification dramatic strengthening began late on october21 and continued through october23 patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00utc on october22 featuring prominent outflow well-defined banding features and a developing eye data from hurricane hunters investigating the cyclone indicated patricia to have reached category4 status on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00utcby the early hours of october23 a clear northward turn took place followed by acceleration northeast a solid ring of 130f 90c cloud tops surrounded the hurricanes 12mi 19km wide eye and signaled its intensification into a category5 hurricane in a 24-hour time span patricias maximum sustained winds increased by 120mph 195kmh the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the national hurricane center nhc the hurricane achieved its peak around 12:00utc on october23 with estimated winds around 215mph 345kmh and a barometric pressure of 872mbar hpa 25.75inhg these values are based upon continued intensification after a hurricane hunter mission into the storm six hours prior in the nhcs report on patricia it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed typhoon tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed but lack of direct observations at the time of its peak prevent analysis of suchlater on october23 rapid weakening ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle took shape and wind shear increased in the five hours up until landfall in mexico patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water however it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23:00utc near cuixmala jalisco with winds of 150mph 240kmh and an analyzed pressure of 932mbar hpa 27.49inhg this made it the most intense pacific hurricane on record to strike mexico once onshore the high terrain of the sierra madre mountains accelerated patricias weakening the low- and mid-level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled with the latter accelerating northeast and patricia dissipated on october24 over central mexico less than 18hours after moving ashorehurricane patricia set multiple records for maximum strength rate of intensification and rate of weakening throughout its relatively short existence with maximum sustained winds of 215mph 345kmh and a minimum pressure of 872mbar hpa 25.75inhg patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the western hemisphere in terms of central pressure it is also the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide just shy of typhoon tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870mbar hpa 25.69inhg patricias one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone surpassing typhoon haiyan of 2013 the magnitude of patricias rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed in a 24-hour period 06:0006:00utc october2223 its maximum sustained winds increased from 85mph 140kmh to 205mph 335kmh a record increase of 120mph 195kmh during the same period patricias central pressure fell by 95mbar hpa 2.81inhg despite record over-water weakening prior to striking mexico patricia became the most intense pacific hurricane to make landfall with a pressure of 932mbar hpa 27.52inhgbefore hurricane patricia arrived the government of mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities a hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00utc on october21 encompassing areas of michoacn colima and jalisco a tropical storm watch also covered portions of guerrero as patricia intensified the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between cabo corrientes jalisco and punta san telmo michoacn a tropical storm warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east the hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of san blas nayarit on october23 once the storm moved inland and the threat of damaging winds diminished these warnings were gradually discontinued on october24following patricias upgrade to category5 status the national hurricane center called the storm potentially catastrophic a source of criticism and praise from various media citing the relatively limited damage and loss of life some outlets including the associated press claimed the agency was exaggerating the danger posed by the storm however most outlets praised them for effectively communicating the dire threat and potentially saving lives from an exceptionally powerful hurricaneacross michoacn colima jalisco and nayarit 1,782shelters were opened on october22 with a collective capacity of 258,000people officials in manzanillo began distributing sandbags during the afternoon of october22 schools across guerrero and jalisco suspended activities for october22 and 23 respectively civil protection officials planned to evacuate roughly 50,000people from colima jalisco and nayarit to expedite the process 2aircraft and 600buses were used to shuttle evacuees ultimately 8,500people evacuated prior to the storms arrival including 2,600 in cabo corrientes one person died during an evacuation in jalisco roughly 25,000personnel from the mexican army navy and federal police were deployed preemptively more than 500red cross volunteers were on standby the mexican red cross prepositioned food for 3,500families approximately 30kg 66lb of aid was prepositioned in colima for distribution after the hurricanes passage the electric federal commission dispatched 2,500crewmen 152cranes 15all-terrain vehicles 4helicopters and 84generators to cope with potential power outages mexican authorities received praise for effectively carrying out emergency preparationsthe precursor of patricia was a large and sprawling system that affected much of central america with heavy rain for several days rainfall was enhanced by the presence of multiple systems including a tropical wave and a second disturbance over the caribbean sea one person was killed in the alta verapaz department and approximately 2,100people required evacuation across guatemala a total of 442homes and 28,200ha 70,000 acres of crops were damaged while roughly 223,000people were affected by flooding government officials deployed emergency teams and 40million quetzal us5.4million was available for relief operations in nearby el salvador between 6.3 and 7.3in 160 and 185mm of rain fell causing similar floods dozens of homes were affected and four people were killed the goascorn river overflowed its banks twice in two days inundating surrounding communities owing to widespread flooding authorities suspended school activities across the country on october19 in nicaragua a landslide buried four miners in bonanza one died while the others were rescued the ula river in honduras over-topped its banks for the first time in 17years on october18 prompting the evacuation of more than 200people furthermore flooding damaged 10homes in jac costa ricathe aforementioned rains extended into southwestern and northeastern mexico falling from october1820 precipitation was enhanced by another tropical disturbance over the northwestern caribbean sea portions of quintana roo saw their most intense rainfall event on record with 19.8in 502mm observed in chetumal this surpassed the previous record of 18in 450mm during hurricane wilma in 2005 flooding affected approximately 1,500homes in the city with 150people seeking refuge in public shelters damage in chetumal was pegged at 1.4billion pesos us84.1million seven municipalities were declared disaster areas accordingly in nearby veracruz more than 24in 600mm of rain caused widespread flooding at least 50municipalities reported damage from the event as multiple rivers over-topped their banks flooding in tabasco affected 7,500ha 19,000 acres of crops in oaxaca several roads were washed out by the accompanying floods and mudslides particularly in the sierra norte region widespread flooding affected large areas of chiapas and guerrero prompting dozens of evacuations in tapachula chiapas 6.6in 168mm of rain fell in just 90minutes triggering flash floods that caught residents by surprise hundreds of families were affected and 64homes were damaged or destroyedhurricane patricia made landfall in jalisco as a category4 hurricane during the evening of october23 the 15mi 24km wide core of patricia largely avoided populated centers passing through areas with a population density less than 30people per square mile this alongside effective evacuations is credited for the relatively low death toll despite the hurricanes intensity several small communities along the path sustained tremendous damage however had the hurricane moved farther east or west the densely populated areas surrounding manzanillo or puerto vallarta would have suffered a direct hitthroughout the affected region the storms powerful winds left 261,989people without electricity twenty-one of the nations thirty-one states and the federal district were affected by the hurricanes rain accumulations in jalisco peaked at 15.09in 383.2mm on nevado de colima roughly 42,000ha 100,000 acres of crops were affected across colima jalisco michoacn and nayarit with 15,000ha 37,000 acres deemed a total loss and 27,000ha 67,000 acres partially damaged six deaths occurred due to direct or indirect effects of the hurricane all in jalisco damage assessments indicate total losses around 5.4billion pesos us323.3million primarily from agriculture and infrastructurestriking jalisco as a strong category4 hurricane patricia wrought tremendous damage though the most extreme effects were relatively localized in the small community of emiliano zapata the hurricanes violent winds tore roofs off homes and business countless trees were defoliated stripped of their branches snapped or uprooted hillsides along the immediate landfall area were largely stripped of vegetation storm chaser josh morgerman described the aftermath  the tropical landscape was transformed into something barren and wintry furthermore the winds toppled concrete power poles and crumpled transmission towersthroughout jalisco approximately 9,000homes were damaged or destroyed the coastal hamlet of chamela home to 40families was completely flattened more than 24,000ha 59,000 acres of crops were affected across the state 10,684ha 26,400 acres sustained

municipalitys history thousands of residents lost their jobs as a result of the damage losses to health facilities in the state reached 13.5million pesos us815,000the hurricane produced large swells along the shores of guerrero on october22 causing damage to coastal structures the remnants of patricia brought heavy rain to much of northern mexico on october24 up to 7.6in 193mm of rain was observed in tamaulipas resulting in flooding dozens of structures sustained damage and hundreds were left without power with areas in reynosa and ro bravo particularly affectedpatricias direct effects in texas were limited to southern areas of the state moisture associated with the hurricane streamed ahead of its circulation and interacted with a frontal boundary over the region antecedent rains saturated the region and produced severe flooding with cars flooded and a train derailed fears arose that the collective effects of these storms would produce deadly floods similar to those in may earlier in the year however no deaths resulted houston received 9.38in 238mm of rain during a 24-hour span from october2425 and a brief tornado caused minor damage near the city rain fell at rates of 1 to 2in 25 to 51mm per hour in southern hidalgo county leading to damaging flash floods an estimated 10 to 12in 250 to 300mm or more accumulated across the progresoweslaco area several feet of water rendered roads impassible stranded cars and affected more than 500homes twenty-six water rescues were conducted in the area damage was estimated at 50million several roads in and around corpus christi were inundated including part of interstate 37 two hours of blinding rains flooded the majority of eastern willacy county prompting multiple water rescues and leaving 2.5million in damage remnant moisture then moved north and northwest through the great lakes appalachia and mid-atlantic states and florida pandhandle before exiting the nationin the aftermath of the hurricane 5,791marines from mexicos naval infantry force were deployed to assist with recovery and rescue efforts rescuers reached some of the hardest-hit areas within a day of patricias landfall red cross volunteers began needs
