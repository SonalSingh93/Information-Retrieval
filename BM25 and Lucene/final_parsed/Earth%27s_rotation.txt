earth s rotation  wikipedia earths rotation is the rotation of planet earth around its own axis earth rotates eastward in prograde motion as viewed from the north pole star polaris earth turns counterclockwisethe north pole also known as the geographic north pole or terrestrial north pole is the point in the northern hemisphere where earths axis of rotation meets its surface this point is distinct from earths north magnetic pole the south pole is the other point where earths axis of rotation intersects its surface in antarcticaearth rotates once in about 24 hours with respect to the sun and once every 23 hours 56 minutes and 4 seconds with respect to the stars see below earths rotation is slowing slightly with time thus a day was shorter in the past this is due to the tidal effects the moon has on earths rotation atomic clocks show that a modern-day is longer by about 1.7milliseconds than a century ago slowly increasing the rate at which utc is adjusted by leap seconds analysis of historical astronomical records shows a slowing trend of 2.3 milliseconds per century since the 8th century bceamong the ancient greeks several of the pythagorean school believed in the rotation of the earth rather than the apparent diurnal rotation of the heavens perhaps the first was philolaus 470385 bce though his system was complicated including a counter-earth rotating daily about a central firea more conventional picture was that supported by hicetas heraclides and ecphantus in the fourth century bce who assumed that the earth rotated but did not suggest that the earth revolved about the sun in the third century bce aristarchus of samos suggested the suns central placehowever aristotle in the fourth century bce criticized the ideas of philolaus as being based on theory rather than observation he established the idea of a sphere of fixed stars that rotated about the earth this was accepted by most of those who came after in particular claudius ptolemy 2nd century ce who thought the earth would be devastated by gales if it rotatedin 499 ce the indian astronomer aryabhata wrote that the spherical earth rotates about its axis daily and that the apparent movement of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the earth he provided the following analogy just as a man in a boat going in one direction sees the stationary things on the bank as moving in the opposite direction in the same way to a man at lanka the xed stars appear to be going westwardin the 10th century some muslim astronomers accepted that the earth rotates around its axis according to al-biruni abu said al-sijzi d circa 1020 invented an astrolabe called al-zraq based on the idea believed by some of his contemporaries that the motion we see is due to the earths movement and not to that of the sky the prevalence of this view is further confirmed by a reference from the 13th century which states according to the geometers or engineers muhandisn the earth is in constant circular motion and what appears to be the motion of the heavens is actually due to the motion of the earth and not the stars treatises were written to discuss its possibility either as refutations or expressing doubts about ptolemys arguments against it at the maragha and samarkand observatories the earths rotation was discussed by tusi b 1201 and qushji b 1403 the arguments and evidence they used resemble those used by copernicusin medieval europe thomas aquinas accepted aristotles view and so reluctantly did john buridan and nicole oresme in the fourteenth century not until nicolaus copernicus in 1543 adopted a heliocentric world system did the contemporary understanding of earths rotation begin to be established copernicus pointed out that if the movement of the earth is violent then the movement of the stars must be very much more so he acknowledged the contribution of the pythagoreans and pointed to examples of relative motion for copernicus this was the first step in establishing the simpler pattern of planets circling a central suntycho brahe who produced accurate observations on which kepler based his laws used copernicuss work as the basis of a system assuming a stationary earth in 1600 william gilbert strongly supported the earths rotation in his treatise on the earths magnetism and thereby influenced many of his contemporaries those like gilbert who did not openly support or reject the motion of the earth about the sun are often called semi-copernicans a century after copernicus riccioli disputed the model of a rotating earth due to the lack of then-observable eastward deflections in falling bodies such deflections would later be called the coriolis effect however the contributions of kepler galileo and newton gathered support for the theory of the rotation of the earththe earths rotation implies that the equator bulges and the poles are flattened in his principia newton predicted this flattening would occur in the ratio of 1:230 and pointed to the 1673 pendulum measurements by richer as corroboration of the change in gravity but initial measurements of meridian lengths by picard and cassini at the end of the 17th century suggested the opposite however measurements by maupertuis and the french geodesic mission in the 1730s established the flattening thus confirming both newton and the copernican positionin the earths rotating frame of reference a freely moving body follows an apparent path that deviates from the one it would follow in a fixed frame of reference because of the coriolis effect falling bodies veer slightly eastward from the vertical plumb line below their point of release and projectiles veer right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern from the direction in which they are shot the coriolis effect is mainly observable at a meteorological scale where it is responsible for the differing rotation direction of cyclones in the northern and southern hemisphereshooke following a 1679 suggestion from newton tried unsuccessfully to verify the predicted eastward deviation of a body dropped from a height of  but definitive results were only obtained later in the late 18th and early 19th century by giovanni battista guglielmini in bologna johann friedrich benzenberg in hamburg and ferdinand reich in freiberg using taller towers and carefully released weights a ball dropped from a height of 158.5m 520ft departed by 27.4mm 1.08in from the vertical compared with a calculated value of 28.1mm 1.11inthe most celebrated test of earths rotation is the foucault pendulum first built by physicist lon foucault in 1851 which consisted of a lead-filled brass sphere suspended  from the top of the panthon in paris because of the earths rotation under the swinging pendulum the pendulums plane of oscillation appears to rotate at a rate depending on latitude at the latitude of paris the predicted and observed shift was about  clockwise per hour foucault pendulums now swing in museums around the worldearths rotation period relative to the sun solar noon to solar noon is its true solar day or apparent solar day it depends on the earths orbital motion and is thus affected by changes in the eccentricity and inclination of earths orbit both vary over thousands of years so the annual variation of the true solar day also varies generally it is longer than the mean solar day during two periods of the year and shorter during another two the true solar day tends to be longer near perihelion when the sun apparently moves along the ecliptic through a greater angle than usual taking about  longer to do so conversely it is about  shorter near aphelion it is about  longer near a solstice when the projection of the suns apparent motion along the ecliptic onto the celestial equator causes the sun to move through a greater angle than usual conversely near an equinox the projection onto the equator is shorter by about  currently the perihelion and solstice effects combine to lengthen the true solar day near  by  solar seconds but the solstice effect is partially cancelled by the aphelion effect near  when it is only  longer the effects of the equinoxes shorten it near  and  by  and  respectivelythe average of the true solar day during the course of an entire year is the mean solar day which contains  solar seconds currently each of these seconds is slightly longer than an si second because earths mean solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal friction the average length of the mean solar day since the introduction of the leap second in 1972 has been about 0 to 2 ms longer than 86,400 si seconds random fluctuations due to core-mantle coupling have an amplitude of about 5 ms the mean solar second between 1750 and 1892 was chosen in 1895 by simon newcomb as the independent unit of time in his tables of the sun these tables were used to calculate the worlds ephemerides between 1900 and 1983 so this second became known as the ephemeris second in 1967 the si second was made equal to the ephemeris secondthe apparent solar time is a measure of the earths rotation and the difference between it and the mean solar time is known as the equation of timeearths rotation period relative to the fixed stars called its stellar day by the international earth rotation and reference systems service iers is  seconds of mean solar time ut1   mean solar days earths rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean vernal equinox named sidereal day is  seconds of mean solar time ut1   mean solar days thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about both the stellar day and the sidereal day are shorter than the mean solar day by about   the mean solar day in si seconds is available from the iers for the periods  and recently 19992010 the average annual length of the mean solar day in excess of 86,400 si seconds has varied between  and  which must be added to both the stellar and sidereal days given in mean solar time above to obtain their lengths in si seconds see fluctuations in the length of daythe angular speed of earths rotation in inertial space is  radians per si second mean solar second multiplying by 180 radians86,400 secondsmean solar day yields 360.9856mean solar day indicating that earth rotates more than 360 relative to the fixed stars in one solar day earths movement along its nearly circular orbit while it is rotating once around its axis requires that earth rotate slightly more than once relative to the fixed stars before the mean sun can pass overhead again even though it rotates only once 360 relative to the mean sun multiplying the value in rads by earths equatorial radius of  wgs84 ellipsoid factors of 2 radians needed by both cancel yields an equatorial speed of 465.1ms 1,526fts or 1,674.4kmh 1,040.4mph some sources state that earths equatorial speed is slightly less or  this is obtained by dividing earths equatorial circumference by  however the use of only one circumference unwittingly implies only one rotation in inertial space so the corresponding time unit must be a sidereal hour this is confirmed by multiplying by the number of sidereal days in one mean solar day  which yields the equatorial speed in mean solar hours given above of the tangential speed of earths rotation at a point on earth can be approximated by multiplying the speed at the equator by the cosine of the latitude for example the kennedy space center is located at latitude 28.59 n which yields a speed of cos 28.59  1,674.4kmh 1,040.4mph 465.1ms  1,470.23kmh 913.56mph 408.40msthe earths rotation axis moves with respect to the fixed stars inertial space the components of this motion are precession and nutation it also moves with respect to the earths crust this is called polar motionprecession is a rotation of the earths rotation axis caused primarily by external torques from the gravity of the sun moon and other bodies the polar motion is primarily due to free core nutation and the chandler wobbleover millions of years the earths rotation slowed significantly by tidal acceleration through gravitational interactions with the moon in this process angular momentum is slowly transferred to the moon at a rate proportional to  where  is the orbital radius of the moon this process gradually increased the length of day to its current value and resulted in the moon being tidally locked with the earththis gradual rotational deceleration is empirically documented with estimates of day lengths obtained from observations of tidal rhythmites and stromatolites a compilation of these measurements found the length of day to increase steadily from about 21 hours at 600myr ago to the current 24 hour value by counting the microscopic lamina that form at higher tides tidal frequencies and thus day lengths can be estimated much like counting tree rings though these estimates can be increasingly unreliable at older agesthe current rate of tidal deceleration is anomalously high implying the earths rotational velocity must have decreased more slowly in the past empirical data tentatively shows a sharp increase in rotational deceleration about 600myr ago some models suggest that the earth maintained a constant day length of 21 hours throughout much of the precambrian this day length corresponds to the semidiurnal resonant period of the thermally-driven atmospheric tide at this day length the decelerative lunar torque could have been canceled by an accelerative torque from the atmospheric tide resulting in no net torque and a constant rotational period this stabilizing effect could have been broken by a sudden change in global temperature recent computational simulations support this hypothesis and suggest the marinoan or sturtian glaciations broke this stable configuration about 600myr ago citing the resemblance of simulated results and existing paleorotational dataadditionally some large scale events such as the 2004 indian ocean earthquake have caused the rotation to speed up by around 3 microseconds by affecting the earths moment of inertia post-glacial rebound ongoing since the last ice age is also changing the distribution of the earths mass thus affecting the moment of inertia of the earth and by the conservation of angular momentum the earths rotation periodthe permanent monitoring of the earths rotation is performed with very-long-baseline interferometry coordinated with the global positioning system satellite laser ranging and other satellite techniques this provides an absolute reference for the determination of universal time precession and nutationthere are preserved observations of solar and lunar eclipses from babylonian astronomy and chinese astronomy beginning from the 8th century bce these observations as well as further astronomical historical records from astronomy in the medieval islamic world and elsewhere can be used to determine the actual changes in the rotation of the earth over the last 27 centuries the calculation to describe the place and time of eclipse is dependent on the rotation of the earth the ancient observations are consistent with the earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from todays value of the speed of rotation would indicate the earth was turning ever faster throughout the past the cumulative effect of the faster turn of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century 36,525 days per century shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the earths rotationthe earths original rotation was a vestige of the original angular momentum of the cloud of dust rocks and gas that coalesced to form the solar system this primordial cloud was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the big bang as well as heavier elements ejected by supernovas as this interstellar dust is heterogeneous any asymmetry during gravitational accretion resulted in the angular momentum of the eventual planethowever if the giant-impact hypothesis for the origin of the moon is correct this primordial rotation rate would have been reset by the theia impact 4.5 billion years ago regardless of the speed and tilt of the earths rotation before the impact it would have experienced a day some five hours long after the impact tidal effects would then have slowed this rate to its modern value
