maine  wikipedia maine  is the northernmost state in the new england region of the northeastern united states maine is the 39th most extensive and the 9th least populous of the us states and territories it is bordered by new hampshire to the west the atlantic ocean to the southeast and the canadian provinces of new brunswick and quebec to the northeast and northwest respectively maine is the easternmost state in the contiguous united states and the northernmost east of the great lakes it is known for its jagged rocky coastline low rolling mountains heavily forested interior and picturesque waterways and also its seafood cuisine especially clams and lobster there is a humid continental climate throughout the state even in coastal areas such as its most populous city of portland the capital is augustafor thousands of years indigenous peoples were the only inhabitants of the territory that is now maine at the time of european arrival in what is now maine several algonquian-speaking peoples inhabited the area the first european settlement in the area was by the french in 1604 on saint croix island by pierre dugua sieur de mons the first english settlement was the short-lived popham colony established by the plymouth company in 1607 a number of english settlements were established along the coast of maine in the 1620s although the rugged climate deprivations and conflict with the local peoples caused many to fail over the yearsas maine entered the 18th century only a half dozen european settlements had survived loyalist and patriot forces contended for maines territory during the american revolution and the war of 1812 at the close of the war of 1812 it was occupied by british forces but the territory of maine was returned to the united states as part of a peace treaty that was to include dedicated land on the michigan peninsula for native american peoples maine was part of the commonwealth of massachusetts until 1820 when it voted to secede from massachusetts to become a separate state on march 15 1820 under the missouri compromise it was admitted to the union as the 23rd statethere is no definitive explanation for the origin of the name maine but the most likely origin is that the name was given by early explorers after the province of maine in france whatever the origin the name was fixed for english settlers in 1665 when the english kings commissioners ordered that the province of maine be entered from then on in official records the state legislature in 2001 adopted a resolution establishing franco-american day which stated that the state was named after the former french province of maine other theories mention earlier places with similar names or claim it is a nautical reference to the mainland attempts to uncover the history of the name of maine began with james sullivans 1795 history of the district of maine he made the unsubstantiated allegation that the province of maine was a compliment to the queen of charles i henrietta maria who once owned the province of maine in france this was quoted by maine historians until the 1845 biography of that queen by agnes strickland established that she had no connection to the province of maine in france further king charles i married henrietta maria in 1625 three years after the name maine first appeared on the charter a new theory put forward by carol b smith fisher in 2002 is that sir ferdinando gorges chose the name in 1622 to honor the village where his ancestors first lived in england rather than the province in france maine appears in the domesday book of 1086 in reference to the county of dorset which is today broadmayne just southeast of dorchesterthe view generally held among british place name scholars is that mayne in dorset is brythonic corresponding to modern welsh maen plural main or meini some early spellings are maine 1086 meine 1200 meines 1204 mayne 1236 today the village is known as broadmayne which is primitive welsh or brythonic main meaning rock or stone considered a reference to the many large sarsen stones still present around little mayne farm half a mile northeast of broadmayne villagethe first known record of the name appears in an august 10 1622 land charter to sir ferdinando gorges and captain john mason english royal navy veterans who were granted a large tract in present-day maine that mason and gorges intend to name the province of maine mason had served with the royal navy in the orkney islands where the chief island is called mainland a possible name derivation for these english sailors in 1623 the english naval captain christopher levett exploring the new england coast wrote the first place i set my foote upon in new england was the isle of shoals being ilands  sic in the sea above two leagues from the mayne initially several tracts along the coast of new england were referred to as main or maine cf the spanish main a reconfirmed and enhanced april 3 1639 charter from englands king charles i gave sir ferdinando gorges increased powers over his new province and stated that it shall forever hereafter be called and named the province or countie of maine and not by any other name or names whatsoever maine is the only state whose name has exactly one syllablethe original inhabitants of the territory that is now maine were algonquian-speaking wabanaki peoples including the passamaquoddy maliseet penobscot kennebec and androscoggin during the later king phillips war many of these peoples would merge in one form or another to become the wabanaki confederacy aiding the wampanoag of massachusetts  the mahican of new york afterwards many of these people were driven from their natural territories but most of the tribes of maine continued unchanged until the american revolution before this point however most of these people were considered separate nations many had adapted to living in permanent iroquois inspired settlements while those along the coast tended to be semi-nomadic-- traveling from settlement to settlement on a yearly cycle they would usually winter inland  head to the coasts by summer  european contact with what is now called maine started around 1200 ce when norwegians interacted with the native penobscot in present-day hancock county most likely through trade about 200 years earlier from the settlements of iceland and greenland norwegians had first identified america and attempted to settle areas such as newfoundland but failed to establish a permanent settlement there archeological evidence suggests that norwegians in greenland returned to north america for several centuries after the initial discovery to collect timber and to trade with the most relevant evidence being the maine penny a 10th-century norwegian coin found at a native american dig site in 1954the first european settlement in maine was in 1604 on saint croix island led by french explorer pierre dugua sieur de mons his party included samuel de champlain noted as an explorer the french named the entire area acadia including the portion that later became the state of maine the first english settlement in maine was established by the plymouth company at the popham colony in 1607 the same year as the settlement at jamestown virginia the popham colonists returned to england after 14 monthsthe french established two jesuit missions one on penobscot bay in 1609 and the other on mount desert island in 1613 the same year castine was established by claude de la tour in 1625 charles de saint-tienne de la tour erected fort pentagouet to protect castine the coastal areas of western maine first became the province of maine in a 1622 land patent eastern maine north of the kennebec river was more sparsely settled and was known in the 17th century as the territory of sagadahock a second settlement was attempted in 1623 by english explorer and naval captain christopher levett at a place called york where he had been granted 6,000 acres 24km by king charles i of england it also failedcentral maine was formerly inhabited by people of the androscoggin tribe of the abenaki nation also known as arosaguntacook they were driven out of the area in 1690 during king williams war they were relocated at st francis canada which was destroyed by rogers rangers in 1759 and is now odanak the other abenaki tribes suffered several severe defeats particularly during dummers war with the capture of norridgewock in 1724 and the defeat of the pequawket in 1725 which greatly reduced their numbers they finally withdrew to canada where they were settled at bcancour and sillery and later at st francis along with other refugee tribes from the souththe province within its current boundaries became part of massachusetts bay colony in 1652 maine was much fought over by the french english and allied natives during the 17th and early 18th centuries who conducted raids against each other taking captives for ransom or in some cases adoption by native american tribes a notable example was the early 1692 abenaki raid on york where about 100 english settlers were killed and another estimated 80 taken hostage the abenaki took captives taken during raids of massachusetts in queen annes war of the early 1700s to kahnewake a catholic mohawk village near montreal where some were adopted and others ransomedafter the british defeated the french in acadia in the 1740s the territory from the penobscot river east fell under the nominal authority of the province of nova scotia and together with present-day new brunswick formed the nova scotia county of sunbury with its court of general sessions at campobello american and british forces contended for maines territory during the american revolution and the war of 1812 with the british occupying eastern maine in both conflicts the territory of maine was confirmed as part of massachusetts when the united states was formed following the treaty of paris ending the revolution although the final border with british north america was not established until the websterashburton treaty of 1842maine was physically separate from the rest of massachusetts long-standing disagreements over land speculation and settlements led to maine residents and their allies in massachusetts proper forcing an 1807 vote in the massachusetts assembly on permitting maine to secede the vote failed secessionist sentiment in maine was stoked during the war of 1812 when massachusetts pro-british merchants opposed the war and refused to defend maine from british invaders in 1819 massachusetts agreed to permit secession sanctioned by voters of the rapidly growing region the following year formal secession and formation of the state of maine as the 23rd state occurred on march 15 1820 as part of the missouri compromise which geographically limited the spread of slavery and enabled the admission to statehood of missouri the following year keeping a balance between slave and free

contrast of forested slopes sweeping down to the sea has been summed up by american poet edna st vincent millay of rockland and camden maine in renascencegeologists describe this type of landscape as a drowned coast where a rising sea level has invaded former land features creating bays out of valleys and islands out of mountain tops a rise in the elevation of the land due to the melting of heavy glacier ice caused a slight rebounding effect of underlying rock this land rise however was not enough to eliminate all the effect of the rising sea level and its invasion of former land featuresmuch of maines geomorphology was created by extended glacial activity at the end of the last ice age prominent glacial features include somes sound and bubble rock both part of acadia national park on mount desert island carved by glaciers somes sound is considered to be the only fjord on the eastern seaboard and reaches depths of 175 feet 50m the extreme depth and steep drop-off allow large ships to navigate almost the entire length of the sound these features also have made it attractive for boat builders such as the prestigious hinckley yachtsbubble rock a glacial erratic is a large boulder perched on the edge of bubble mountain in acadia national park by analyzing the type of granite geologists were able to discover that glaciers carried bubble rock to its present location from near the
