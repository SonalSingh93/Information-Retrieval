tropical storm larry  wikipedia tropical storm larry was the twelfth tropical storm in the 2003 atlantic hurricane season it was one of eight storms to impact mexico from either the pacific or atlantic oceans in the season a near-record larry formed in early october from an extratropical storm in the bay of campeche and reached a peak intensity of 65mph 100kmh due to weak steering currents the storm moved southward which resulted in the storm hitting the tabasco coastline the storm was the first tabascan landfall since tropical storm brenda in 1973larry drifted across the isthmus of tehuantepec dropping heavy rainfall of over 9in 229mm in places the rainfall led to flooding and mudslides causing damage to thousands of houses the flooding killed five people and resulted in 53.6million 2003usd in damage larry was one of three tropical cyclones to hit mexico in a short period of time including tropical depression nora and tropical storm olaf in the eastern pacific oceana tropical wave moved off the coast of africa on september 17 it moved across the shear-ridden atlantic ocean without development and remained disorganized until reaching the western caribbean sea on september 26 there the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop on the september 27 a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of the yucatn peninsula the system continued to organize and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on the yucatn peninsula on september 29dry air and land weakened the tropical wave and when it entered the area of the bay of campeche it merged with a stationary frontal boundary cool dry air around the system caused the system to develop a cold core and the area organized into an extratropical low on september 30 a large high pressure system over the northern gulf of mexico forced the system southward where it developed significant convection the system developed a warm core and on october 1 the storm organized into tropical storm larry while located 300mi 483km east-southeast of tampico mexicoweak steering currents allowed for larry to drift westward at about twomph 3kmh while marginally favorable conditions allowed the storm to strengthen to a peak of 65mph 105kmh on october 3 a mid-level ridge forced the storm more to the south-southeast where after remaining a 60mph 97kmh storm for three days larry made landfall on paraso in the mexican state of tabasco on october 5 it steadily weakened over land and degenerated into a remnant low on october 6 while midway through the isthmus of tehuantepec the remnant low turned to the southwest and reached the eastern pacific ocean on the october 7 the remnants of larry re-organized in the eastern pacific with the national hurricane center indicating for the possibility of redevelopment into a tropical depression on october 9 however the convection diminished and further development was no longer anticipateddue to its erratic motion the mexican government issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch early in larrys lifetime from veracruz to campeche the watches and warnings were extended westward to tuxpan on the 4th and extended eastward to ciudad del carmen on october 5 due to the threat of the storm officials closed three pemex oil ports the company used its reserves to make sure profits werent disrupted in addition the storm closed shipping ports in dos bocas in tabasco coatzacoalcos in veracruz and cayo arcas in campeche the mexican government placed six coastal states on maximum alert while authorities set up 75 evacuation shelters for around 1,500people because of the storm the government declared much of eastern mexico a state of emergencytropical storm larry was one of eight storms to hit mexico from either the atlantic ocean or the pacific ocean the highest since the record of nine in 1971 the national hurricane center expected the storm to produce a storm surge of 3 to 5feet 9 to 1.5m with high waves on top though no official surge readings were reported the highest recorded winds on land were 59mph 95kmh in el alacrn in tabasco the worst of larrys effects came from its rainfall peaking at 24.77inches 629.2mm in upper juarez in southeastern mexico the highest 24-hour rainfall total was 9.6inches 245.5mm in tortuguero chiapas while several other locations reported over 4inches 102mm in 24hoursthe flooding damaged more than 21,000houses across mexico in combination with the damage from eastern pacific hurricanes nora and olaf damage was greatest around the chiapas capital of tuxtla gutirrez where over 9,000houses were affected the rainfall caused mudslides across the country hospitalizing two individuals in central hidalgo the flooding also caused severe crop damage along larrys path strong wind gusts caused outages to telephone and power services in all larry caused five deaths and 53.6million in damage 2003usd 59million 2005usdin el salvador rainfall from the remnants of larrycombined with previous rainfallcaused mudslides and flooding forcing several thousand people to evacuate in san salvador the flooding destroyed or damaged hundreds of housestropical storm larry hit mexico at around the same time as two other tropical storms the mexican red cross provided aid for 6,587 families throughout the country while the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies launched an international appeal for aid the appeal raised 284,472.8 2003usd the mexican red cross distributed 4,000 food and hygiene packets to various places and delivered 2,750 family packets and over 4,300 mattresses to citizens in
