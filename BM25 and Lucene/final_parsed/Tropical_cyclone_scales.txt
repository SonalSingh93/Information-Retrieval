tropical cyclone scales  wikipedia tropical cyclones are officially ranked on one of five tropical cyclone intensity scales according to their maximum sustained winds and which tropical cyclone basins they are located in only a few scales of classifications are used officially by the meteorological agencies monitoring the tropical cyclones but some alternative scales also exist such as accumulated cyclone energy the power dissipation index the integrated kinetic energy index and the hurricane severity indextropical cyclones that develop in the northern hemisphere are officially classified by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist within the north atlantic ocean or the north-eastern pacific ocean are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms should a system intensify further and become a hurricane then it will be classified on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale which is based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period in the western pacific the typhoon committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute periodthe india meteorological departments scale uses 7 different classifications for systems within the north indian ocean and are based on the systems estimated 3-minute maximum sustained winds tropical cyclones that develop in the southern hemisphere are only officially classified by the warning centres on off two scales which are both based on 10-minute sustained wind speeds the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which is used to classify systems within the australian or south pacific tropical cyclone basins the scale used to classify systems in the south-west indian ocean and is adapted by meteo france for use in various french territories including new caledonia and french polynesiathe definition of sustained winds recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo and used by most weather agencies is that of a 10-minute average at a height of 10m 33ft however the saffirsimpson hurricane scale is based on wind speed measurements averaged over a 1-minute period at 10m 33ft above the surface the scale used by rsmc new delhi applies a 3-minute averaging period and the australian scale is based on both 3-second wind gusts and maximum sustained winds averaged over a 10-minute interval these make direct comparisons between basins difficultwithin all basins tropical cyclones are named when the sustained winds hit 35kn 40mph 65kmhtropical cyclones are defined as being warm cored non-frontal synoptic cyclones that develop over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and have a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation they are classified by the wind speeds located around the circulation centre and are ranked by the world meteorological organisations regional specialized meteorological centers on one of five tropical cyclone scales the scale used for a particular tropical cyclone depends on what basin the system is located in with for example the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale and the australian tropical cyclone intensity scales both used in the western hemisphere all of the scales rank tropical cyclones using their maximum sustained winds which are either observed measured or estimated using various techniques over a period between one and ten minutestropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere to the east of the anti-meridian are officially monitored by either the national hurricane center or the central pacific hurricane center within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored non-frontal synoptic disturbance that develops over tropical or subtropical waters with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre the region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones once either of these classifications are met then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn 38mph 62kmh however if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 3463kn 3973mph 63118kmh then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a nameshould the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured as greater than 64kn 74mph 119kmh then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale the lowest classification on the sshws is a category 1 hurricane which has winds of between 6482kn 7495mph 119153kmh should the hurricane intensify further then it will be rated as a category 2 hurricane if it has winds of between 8395kn 96110mph 154177kmh when a system becomes a category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96112kn 111129mph 178208kmh it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning centers a category 4 hurricane has winds of 113136kn 130156mph 209251kmh while a category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn 157mph 252kmh a post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage however advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone poses a significant threat to life and property they may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hoursthe sshs was originally created using both wind speed and storm surge but since the relationship between wind speed and storm surge is not necessarily definite the scale was changed to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale sshws based entirely on wind speedalthough increasing echelons of the scale correspond to stronger winds the rankings are not absolute in terms of effects lower-category storms can inflict greater damage than higher-category storms depending on factors such as local terrain population density and total rainfall for instance a category2 hurricane that strikes a major urban area will likely do more damage than a large category5 hurricane that strikes a mostly rural region in fact tropical systems of less than hurricane strength can produce significant damage and human casualties especially from flooding and landslideshistorically the term great hurricane was used to describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110kn 125mph 200kmh large radii over 160km  100mi and that caused large amounts of destruction this term fell into disuse after the introduction of the saffirsimpson scale in the early 1970sa minor change to the scale was made ahead of the 2012 hurricane season with the wind speeds for categories 35 tweaked to eliminate the rounding errors that had occurred during previous seasons when a hurricane had wind speeds of 115kn 130mph 215kmhtropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere between the anti-meridian and 100e are officially monitored by the japan meteorological agency jma rsmc tokyo within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale cyclone originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation the lowest classification used by the typhoon committee is a tropical depression which has 10-minute sustained winds of less than 33kn 17ms 38mph 61kmh should the tropical depression intensify further it is named and classified as a tropical storm which has winds speeds between 3347kn 1724ms 3854mph 6187kmh should the system continue to intensify further then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm which has winds speeds between 4863kn 2532ms 5572mph 89117kmh the highest classification on the typhoon committees scale is a typhoon which has winds speeds greater than 64kn 33ms 74mph 119kmhthe china meteorological administration the hong kong observatory hko pagasa and the jma all divide the typhoon category further for domestic purposes the jma divides the typhoon category into three categories with a 10-minute maximum wind speed below 84kn 43ms 97mph 156kmh assigned for the strong typhoon category a very strong typhoon has wind speeds between 85104kn 4454ms 98120mph 157193kmh while a violent typhoon has wind speeds of 105kn 54ms 121mph 194kmh or greater the hko and the cma also divide the typhoon category into three categories with both assigning a maximum wind speed of 80kn 41ms 92mph 150kmh to the typhoon category a severe typhoon has wind speeds of 85104kn 4454ms 98120mph 157193kmh while a super typhoon has winds of 100kn 51ms 120mph 190kmh during may 2015 pagasa introduced the term super typhoon and used it for systems with winds greater than 120kn 62ms 140mph 220kmhin addition to the national meteorological services of each nation the united states joint typhoon warning center monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones for the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however the jtwc uses their own scale for intensity classifications in this basin these classifications are tropical depression tropical storm typhoon and super typhoon in addition the taiwan central weather bureau has its own scale in chinese but uses the typhoon committee scale in englishany tropical cyclone that develops within the north indian ocean between 100e and 45e is monitored by the india meteorological department imd rsmc new delhi within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation the lowest official classification used in the north indian ocean is a depression which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 1727kn 2031mph 3149kmh should the depression intensify further then it will become a deep depression which has winds between 2833kn 3238mph 5061kmh the system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the imd if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 3447kn 3954mph 6288kmh severe cyclonic storms have storm force wind speeds of between 4863kn 5572mph 89117kmh while very severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force winds of 6489kt 73102mph 118166kmh extremely severe cyclonic storms have hurricane-force winds of 90119kn 166221kmh 104137mph the highest classification used in the north indian ocean is a super cyclonic storm which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn 138mph 222kmhhistorically a system has been classified as a depression if it is an area where the barometric pressure is low compared with its surroundings other classifications historically used include cyclonic storm where the winds did not exceed force 10 on the beaufort scale and a cyclone where the winds are either force 11 and 12 on the beaufort scale between 1924 and 1988 tropical cyclones were classified into four categories depression deep depression cyclonic storms and severe cyclonic storms however a change was made during 1988 to introduce the category severe cyclonic storm with core of hurricane winds for tropical cyclones with wind speeds of more than 64kn 74mph 119kmh during 1999 the categories very severe cyclonic storm and super cyclonic storm were introduced while the severe cyclonic storm with a core of hurricane winds category was eliminated during 2015 another modification to the intensity scale took place with the imd calling a system with 3-minute maximum sustained wind speeds between 90119kn 166221kmh 104137mph an extremely severe cyclonic storm the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclonesany tropical cyclone that develops within the southern hemisphere between africa and 90e is monitored by meteo frances la reunion tropical cyclone centre mfr rsmc la reunion within the region a tropical disturbance is defined to be a non-frontal synoptic scale low pressure area originating over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation with the average wind speed estimated to be not exceeding 27 knots 50kmha tropical disturbance is mfrs generic term for a non-frontal area of low pressure that has organized convection and definite cyclonic surface wind circulation the system should be estimated to have wind speeds of less than 28knots 50kmh 32mpha system is designated as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28knots 50kmh 32mph should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35knots 65kmh 40mph then it will be classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the sub regional center in mauritius or madagascar no matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin it is always designated as a subtropical depressionshould the named storm intensify further and reach winds speeds of 48knots 89kmh 55mph then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm a severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64knots 118kmh 74mph should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90knots 166kmh 103mph it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone a very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the south-west indian ocean tropical cyclone scale and has winds of over 115knots 212kmh 132mphat the tenth ra i tropical cyclone committee held during 1991 it was recommended that the intensity classifications be changed ahead of the 199394 tropical cyclone season specifically it was decided that the classifications weak tropical depression moderate tropical depression and severe tropical depression would be changed to tropical depression moderate tropical storm and severe tropical storm this change was implemented ahead of the 199394 tropical cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in this basin the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclonestropical cyclones that occur within the southern hemisphere to the east of 90e are officially monitored by one or more tropical cyclone warning centres these are run by the fiji meteorological service new zealands metservice indonesias badan meteorologi klimatologi dan geofisika papua new guineas national weather service while three others are run by the australian bureau of meteorology within the region a tropical cyclone is defined as being a non-frontal low pressure system of synoptic scale that develops over warm waters with a definite organized wind circulation and 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 34kn 63kmh 39mph or greater near the centre once this definition has been met then all of the centres name the system and start to use the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale which measures tropical cyclones using a five category system based on 10-minute maximum sustained winds a category 1 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 3447kn 3954mph 6387kmh while a category 2 tropical cyclone is estimated to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 4863kn 5572mph 89117kmh when a system becomes a category 3 tropical cyclone it is reclassified as a severe tropical cyclone and has wind speeds of 6485kn 7498mph 119157kmh a category 4 severe tropical cyclone has winds of 86110 kn 99130mph 157200kmh while the maximum rating is a category 5 severe tropical cyclone which has winds of at least 110kn 130mph 200kmhfor systems below tropical cyclone strength there are various terms used including tropical disturbance tropical low and tropical depression a tropical disturbance is defined as being a non frontal system of synoptic scale originating over the tropics with persistent enhanced convection andor some indication of a circulation a tropical depression or tropical low is a disturbance with a defined circulation where the central position can be estimated and the maximum 10-minute average wind speed is less than 34kn 39mph 63kmh near the centre the fms numbers these systems when they have a potential to develop into a tropical cyclone or persist to cause significant impact to life and property within its area of responsibility and have been analysed for the previous 24 hours the australian tropical cyclone intensity scale was introduced by the bom ahead of the 198990 cyclone season the united states joint typhoon warning center also monitors the basin and issues warnings on significant tropical cyclones on behalf of the united states government these warnings use a 1-minute sustained wind speed and can be compared to the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale however regardless of intensity in these basins the jtwc labels all systems as tropical cyclonesthere are other scales that are not officially used by any of the regional specialized meteorological centres or the tropical cyclone warning centres however they are used by other organizations such as the national oceanic and atmospheric administration an example of such scale is the integrated kinetic energy index which measures the destructive potential of the storm surge it works on a scale that ranges from one to six with six having the highest destructive potentialaccumulated cyclone energy ace is used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and other agencies to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons it is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm wind speed 35 knots or higher at six-hour intervals the numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable the unit of ace is 10 kn and for use as an index the unit is assumed as well as being squared for ace wind speed can also be cubed which is referred to as the power dissipation index pdithe hurricane severity index hsi is another scale used and rates the severity of all types of tropical and subtropical cyclones based on both the intensity and the size of their wind fields the hsi is a 0 to 50 point scale allotting up to 25 points for a tropical cyclones intensity and up to 25 points for wind field size points are awarded on a sliding scale with the majority of points reserved for hurricane force and greater wind fieldsthe terminology for tropical cyclones differs from one region to another below is a summary of the classifications used by the official warning centres worldwide
