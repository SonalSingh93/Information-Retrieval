was greeted by hundreds of small outrigger canoes that appeared to be flying over the water due to their considerable speed these outrigger canoes were called proas and resulted in magellan naming guam islas de las velas latinas islands of the lateen sails antonio pigafetta one of magellans original 18 said that the name was island of sails but he also writes that the inhabitants entered the ships and stole whatever they could lay their hands on including the small boat that was fastened to the poop of the flagship those people are poor but ingenious and very thievish on account of which we called those three islands islas de los ladrones islands of thievesdespite magellans visit guam was not officially claimed by spain until january 26 1565 by general miguel lpez de legazpi from 1565 to 1815 guam and the northern mariana islands the only spanish outpost in the pacific ocean east of the philippines was an important resting stop for the manila galleons a fleet that covered the

of spains colony in the philippines while the islands chamorro culture has indigenous roots the cultures of both guam and the northern marianas have many similarities with spanish culture due to three centuries of spanish ruleintermittent warfare lasting from july 23 1670 until july 1695 plus the typhoons of 1671 and 1693 and in particular the smallpox epidemic of 1688 reduced the chamorro population from 50,000 to 10,000 to less than 5,000 precipitated by the death of quipuha and the murder of father san vitores and pedro calungsod by local rebel chief matapang tensions led to a number of conflicts captain juan de santiago started a campaign to conquer the island which was continued by the successive commanders of the spanish forcesafter his arrival in 1674 captain damian de esplana

search for the rebels who had assassinated father san vitores resulting in campaigns against the rebels which were hiding out in some islands eventually leading to the death of matapang hurao and aguarin quiroga brought some natives from the northern islands to guam ordering the population to live in a few large villages these included jinapsan umatac pago agat and inarajan where he built a number of churches by july 1695 quiroga had completed the conquest of guam rota tinian and aguiganon february 26 1767 charles iii of spain issued a decree confiscating the property of the jesuits and

become a league of nations mandate assigned to japan in 1919 pursuant to the treaty of versailles of 1919 it was the chamorros indigenous island people from the northern marianas who were brought to guam to serve as interpreters and in other capacities for the occupying japanese force the guamanian chamorros were treated as an occupied enemy by the japanese military after the war this would cause resentment between the guamanian chamorros and the chamorros of the northern marianas guams chamorros believed their northern brethren should have been compassionate towards them whereas having been administered by japan for over 30 years the northern mariana chamorros were loyal to the japanese governmentthe japanese occupation of guam lasted for approximately thirty-one months during this period the indigenous people of guam were subjected to forced labor family separation incarceration execution concentration camps and forced prostitution approximately one thousand people died during

location on the western edge of the pacific plate and near the philippine sea plate in recent years earthquakes with epicenters near guam have had magnitudes ranging from 5.0 to 8.7 unlike the anatahan volcano in the northern mariana islands guam is not volcanically active however due to its proximity to anatahan vog ie volcanic smog does occasionally affect guama coral table reef surrounds

pamela in 1976 wooden structures have been largely replaced by concrete structures during the 1980s wooden utility poles began to be replaced by typhoon-resistant concrete and steel poles after the local government enforced stricter construction codes many home and business owners built their structures out of reinforced concrete with installed typhoon shuttersbased on a 2010 estimate the largest ethnic group are the native chamorros accounting for 37.3% of the total population other significant ethnic groups include those of filipino 26.3% white 7.1% and chuukese 7% ethnicities the rest are from other pacific islands or of asian ancestrythe official languages of the island are english and chamorroaccording to the pew research center 2010post-european-contact chamorro guamanian culture is a combination of american spanish filipino other micronesian islander and mexican traditions few indigenous pre-hispanic customs remained following spanish contact hispanic influences are manifested in the local language music dance sea navigation cuisine fishing games such as batu chonka estuleks and bayogu songs and fashionduring spanish colonial rule 16681898 the majority of the population was converted to roman catholicism and religious festivities such as easter and christmas became widespread post-contact chamorro cuisine is largely based on corn and includes tortillas tamales atole and chilaquiles which are a clear influence from mesoamerica principally mexico from spanish trade with asiathe modern chamorro language has many historical parallels to modern philippine languages in that it is an austronesian language which has absorbed much spanish vocabulary it is a malayo-polynesian language along with such languages as tagalog indonesian hawaiian and even maori despite being spoken in the mid pacific ocean which is geographically closer to speakers of the polynesian islands chamorro is actually an outlier of the sundasulawesi languages subgroup chamorro is thus more closely related to and a part of the languages of the malay archipelago rather than its neighbours in polynesia among the languages of malay archipelago chamorro is most closely related to the languages in the south of the chain of islands within indonesia rather than the languages of the north in the philippines with which it shares linguistic spanish colonial influencealso like filipinos many chamorros possess spanish surnames despite few of the inhabitants actually descending from the spanish colonisers spanish names and surnames were adopted after their conversion to roman catholic christianity in a phenomenon prompted by the imposition of the catlogo alfabtico de apellidos in guam and other territories of the spanish east indies most notably the philippinesdue to foreign cultural influence from spain most aspects of the early indigenous culture have been lost though there has been a resurgence in preserving any remaining pre-hispanic culture in the last few decades some scholars have traveled throughout the pacific islands conducting research to study what the original chamorro cultural practices such as dance language and canoe building may have been liketwo aspects of indigenous pre-hispanic culture that withstood time are chenchule and inafamaolek chenchule is the intricate system of reciprocity at the heart of chamorro society it is rooted in the core value of inafamaolek historian lawrence cunningham in 1992 wrote in a chamorro sense the land and its produce belong to everyone  or interdependence is the key or central value in chamorro culture  depends on a spirit of cooperation and sharing this is the armature or core that everything in chamorro culture revolves around it is a powerful concern for mutuality rather than individualism and private property rightsthe core culture or pengngan chamorro is based on complex social protocol centered upon respect from sniffing over the hands of the elders called mangnginge in chamorro the passing down of legends chants and courtship rituals to a person asking for permission from spiritual ancestors before entering a jungle or ancient battle grounds other practices predating spanish conquest include galaide canoe-making making of the belembaotuyan a string musical instrument made from a gourd fashioning of  slings and slingstones tool manufacture  burial rituals and preparation of herbal medicines by suruhanumaster craftsmen and women specialize in weavings including plaited work niyok- and kgak-leaf baskets mats bags hats and food containments loom-woven material kalachucha-hibiscus and banana fiber skirts belts and burial shrouds and body ornamentation bead and shell necklaces bracelets earrings belts and combs made from tortoise shells and spondylusthe cosmopolitan and multicultural nature of modern guam poses challenges for chamorros struggling to preserve their culture and identity amidst forces of acculturation the increasing numbers of chamorros especially chamorro youth relocating to the us mainland has further complicated both definition and preservation of chamorro identity while only a few masters exist to continue traditional art forms the resurgence of interest among the chamorros to preserve the language and culture has resulted in a growing number of young chamorros who seek to continue the ancient ways of the chamorro peopleguam hosted the pacific games in 1975 and 1999 at the 2007 games guam finished 7th of 22 countries and 14th at the 2011 gamesthe guam national football team was founded in 1975 and

give citizens of these island nations generally no restrictions to reside in the united states also its territories and many were attracted to guam due to its proximity environmental and cultural familiarity over the years it was claimed by some in guam that the territory has had to bear the brunt of this agreement in the form of public assistance programs and public education for those from the regions involved and the federal government should compensate the states and territories affected by this type of migration over the years congress had appropriated compact impact aids to guam the northern mariana islands and hawaii and eventually this appropriation was written into each renewed compact some however continue to claim the compensation is not enough or that the distribution of

the national presidential race these delegates are elected by local party conventionsin the 1980s and early 1990s there was a significant movement in favor of this us territory becoming a commonwealth which would give it a level of self-government similar to puerto rico and the northern mariana islands however the federal government rejected the version of a commonwealth that the government of guam proposed because its clauses were incompatible with the territorial clause art iv sec 3 cl 2 of the us constitution other movements advocate us statehood for guam union with the state of hawaii or union with the northern mariana islands as a single territory or independencein a 1982 plebiscite voters indicated interest in seeking commonwealth status the island has been considering another non-binding plebiscite on decolonization since 1998 governor eddie baza calvo intended to include one during the islands november 2016 elections but it was delayed againa commission on decolonization

series of education sessions in various villages about the current status of guams relationship with the us and the self-determination options that might be considered the commissions current

closely with the commission in developing educational materials for the publicthe united states department of the interior had approved a 300,000 grant for decolonization education edward alvarez told the united nations pacific regional seminar in may 2016 we are hopeful that this might indicate a shift in united states policy to its non-self-governing territories such as guam where they will be more willing to engage in discussions about our future and offer true support to help push us towards true self-governances and self-determinationguam is divided into nineteen municipalities called villagesthe us military maintains jurisdiction over its bases which cover approximately 39,000 acres 16,000ha or 29% of the islands total land areain addition to on-shore military installations guam along with the rest of the mariana islands is being prepared to be the westernmost military training range for the us guam is currently viewed as a key military hub that will further allow us military power to be projected via sea and skythe us military has proposed building a new aircraft carrier berth on guam and moving 8,600 marines and 9,000 of their dependents to guam from okinawa japan including the required construction workers this buildup would increase guams population by 45% in a february 2010 letter the united states environmental protection agency sharply criticized these plans because of a water shortfall sewage problems and the impact on coral reefs by 2012 these plans had been cut to have only a maximum of 4,800 marines stationed on the island two thirds of whom would be there on a rotational basis without their dependentswith the proposed increased military presence stemming from the upcoming preparation efforts and relocation efforts of us marines from okinawa japan to guam slated to begin in 2010 and last for the next several years thereafter the amount of total land that the military will control or tenant may grow to or surpass 40% of the entire landmass of guamin january 2011 the ike skelton national defense authorization act for fy2011 indicated that recent significant events will delay the deadline for realigning us marine corps service members and their families from okinawa to guam the transfer may be as late as 2020 in addition the defense authorization act cut approximately 320 million from the 2011 budget requestvillagers and the military community are interconnected in many ways many villagers serve in the military or are retired many active duty personnel and defense department civilians also live in the villages outside

australia and asia guam currently serves twelve submarine cables with most continuing to chinain 1899 the local postage stamps were overprinted guam as was done for the other former spanish colonies but this was discontinued shortly thereafter and regular us postage stamps have been used ever since because guam is also part of the us postal system postal abbreviation gu zip code range 9691096932

regard guam as domesticthe speed of mail traveling between guam and the states varies depending on size and time of year light first-class items generally take less than a week to or from the mainland but larger first-class or priority items can take a week or two fourth-class mail such as magazines are transported by sea after reaching hawaii most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available incoming mail not from the americas should be addressed to guam instead of usa to avoid being routed the long way through the us mainland and possibly charged a higher rate especially from asiathe commercial port of guam is the islands lifeline because most products must be shipped into guam for consumers it receives the weekly calls of the hawaii-based shipping line matson inc whose container ships connect guam with honolulu hawaii los angeles california oakland california and seattle washington the port is also the regional transhipment hub for over 500,000 customers throughout the micronesian region the port is the shipping and receiving point for containers designated for the islands us department of defense installations andersen air force base and commander naval forces marianas and eventually the third marine expeditionary forceguam is served by the antonio b won pat international airport which is a hub for united airlines the island is outside the united states customs zone so guam is responsible for establishing and operating its own customs and quarantine agency and jurisdiction therefore the us customs and border protection only carries immigration but not customs functions since guam is under federal immigration jurisdiction passengers arriving directly from the united states skip immigration and proceed directly to guam customs and quarantinehowever due to the guam and cnmi visa waiver program for certain countries an eligibility pre-clearance check is carried on guam for flights to the states for travel from the northern mariana islands to guam a pre-flight passport and visa check is performed before boarding the flight to guam on flights from guam to the northern mariana islands no immigration check is performed traveling between guam and the states through a foreign point however does require a passportmost residents travel within guam using personally owned vehicles the local government currently outsources the only public bus system guam regional transit authority and some commercial companies operate buses between tourist-frequented locationsbelieved to be a stowaway on a us military transport near the end of world war ii the brown tree snake boiga irregularis was accidentally introduced to guam which previously had no native species of snake it nearly eliminated the native bird population the problem was exacerbated because the snake has no natural predators on the island the brown tree snake known locally as the kulebla is native to northern and eastern coasts of australia papua new guinea and the solomon islands it is slightly venomous but relatively harmless to human beings it is nocturnal although some studies have suggested a high density of these serpents on guam residents rarely see them the united states department of agriculture has trained detector dogs to keep the snakes out of the islands cargo flow the united states geological survey also has dogs that can detect snakes in forested environments around the regions islandsbefore the introduction of the brown tree snake guam was home to several endemic bird species among them were the guam rail or koko bird in chamorro and the guam flycatcher both common throughout the island today the flycatcher is entirely extinct and the guam rail is extinct in the wild but bred in captivity by the division of aquatic and wildlife resources the devastation caused by the snake has been significant over the past several decades as many as twelve bird species are believed to have been driven to extinction according to many elders koko birds were common in guam before world war iiother bird species threatened by the brown tree snake include the mariana crow the mariana swiftlet and the micronesian starling though populations are present on other islands including rotaguam is said to have many more insects and 40 times more spiders than neighboring islands because their natural predators birds are severely diminished and the forests are almost completely silent due to lack of birdsongan infestation of the coconut rhinoceros beetle crb oryctes rhinoceros was detected on guam on september 12 2007 crb is not known to occur in the united states except in american samoa delimiting surveys performed september 1325 2007 indicated that the infestation was limited to tumon bay and faifai beach an area of approximately 900 acres 3.6km guam department of agriculture gda placed quarantine on all properties within the tumon area on october 5 and later expanded the quarantine to about 2,500 acres 10km on october 25 approximately 0.5 miles 800m radius in all directions from all known locations of crb infestation crb is native to southern asia and distributed throughout asia and the western pacific including sri lanka upolu samoa american samoa palau new britain west irian new ireland pak island and manus island new guinea fiji cocos keeling islands mauritius and reunionfrom the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries the spanish introduced pigs dogs chickens the philippine deer rusa mariannus black francolins and carabao a subspecies of water buffalo which have cultural significance herds of carabao obstruct military base operations and harm native ecosystems after birth control and adoption efforts were ineffective the us military began culling the herds in 2002 leading to organized protests from island residentsother introduced species include cane toads imported in 1937 the giant african snail an agricultural pest introduced during world warii by japanese occupation troops and more recently frog species which could threaten crops in addition to providing additional food for the brown tree snake population reports of loud chirping frogs native to puerto rico and known as coqu that may have arrived from hawaii have led to fears that the noise could threaten guams tourismguam has no native amphibian species but now a total of eight amphibian species has been established in guam litoria fallax native to the eastern coast of australia has been present in guam since 1968 and rhinella marina the cane toad was brought to the island in 1937 the other 6 amphibian species namely hylarana guentheri native to mainland asia microhyla pulchra native to mainland asia polypedates braueri endemic to taiwan eleutherodactylus planirostris native to the caribbean fejervarya cancrivora the guam variety being most closely related to f cancrivora found in taiwan and fejervarya limnocharis native to southeast asia have been in guam since 2003 many species were likely inadvertently introduced via shipping cargo especially from taiwan mainland china and southeast asiaintroduced feral pigs and deer over-hunting and habitat loss from human development are also major factors in the decline and loss of guams native plants and animalsinvading animal species are not the only threat to guams native flora tinangaja a virus affecting coconut palms was first observed on the island in 1917 when copra production was still a major part of guams economy though coconut plantations no longer exist on the island the dead and infected trees that have resulted from the epidemic are seen throughout the forests of guamduring the past century the dense forests of northern guam have been largely replaced by thick tangan-tangan brush leucaena leucocephala much of guams foliage was lost during world war ii in 1947 the us military is thought to have planted tangan-tangan by seeding the island from the air to prevent erosion tangan-tangan was present on the island before 1905in southern guam non-native grass species dominate much of the landscape although the colorful and impressive flame tree delonix regia is found throughout the marianas the tree on guam has been largely decimatedwildfires plague the forested areas of guam every dry season despite the islands humid climate most fires are caused by humans with 80% resulting from arson poachers often start fires to attract deer to the new growth invasive grass species that rely on fire as part of their natural life cycle grow in many regularly burned areas grasslands and barrens have replaced previously forested areas leading to greater soil erosion during the rainy season sediment is carried by the heavy rains into the fena lake reservoir and ugum river leading to water quality problems for southern guam eroded silt also destroys the marine life in reefs around the island soil stabilization efforts by volunteers and forestry workers planting trees have had little success in preserving natural habitatsefforts have been made to protect guams coral reef habitats from pollution eroded silt and overfishing problems that have led to decreased fish populations since guam is a significant vacation spot for scuba divers this is important in recent years the department of agriculture division of aquatic and wildlife resources has established several new marine preserves where fish populations are monitored by biologists before adopting us environmental protection agency standards portions of tumon bay were dredged by the hotel chains to provide a better experience for hotel guests tumon bay has since been made into a preserve a federal guam national wildlife refuge in northern guam protects the decimated sea turtle population in addition to a small colony of mariana fruit batsharvest of sea turtle eggs was a common occurrence on guam before world war ii the green sea turtle chelonia mydas was harvested legally on guam before august 1978 when it was listed as threatened under the endangered species act the hawksbill sea turtle eretmochelys imbricata has been on the endangered list since 1970 in an effort to ensure protection of sea turtles on guam routine sightings are counted during aerial surveys and nest sites are recorded and monitored for hatchlingswhitespotted boxfish ostracion meleagristhe university of
