bar  unit   wikipedia the bar is a metric unit of pressure but is not approved as part of the international system of units si it is defined as exactly equal to 100,000pa which is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on earth at sea levelthe bar and the millibar were introduced by the norwegian meteorologist vilhelm bjerknes who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecastinguse of the bar is deprecated by professional bodies in some fields the international bureau of weights and measures bipm lists the bar as one of the non-si units that authors should have the freedom to use but declines to include it among the non-si units accepted for use with the si the us national institute of standards and technology nist deprecates its use except for limited use in meteorology and lists it as one of several units that must not be introduced in fields where they are not presently used the international astronomical union iau also lists it under non-si units and symbols whose continued use is deprecated as of 2004 the bar is legally recognized in countries of the european unionunits derived from the bar include the megabar symbol mbar kilobar symbol kbar decibar symbol dbar centibar symbol cbar and millibar symbol mbar or mb the notation barg though deprecated by various bodies represents gauge pressure ie pressure in bars above ambient or atmospheric pressurethe bar is defined using the si derived unit pascal   100,000 pa  100,000 nmthus  is equal toand 1 bar is approximately equal tonotesthe word bar has its origin in the greek word   meaning weight the units official symbol is bar the earlier symbol b is now deprecated and conflicts with the use of b denoting the unit barn but it is still encountered especially as mb rather than the proper mbar to denote the millibar between 1793 and 1795 the word bar was used for a unit of weight in an early version of the metric systematmospheric air pressure is often given in millibars where standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined as 1013.25 mbar 101.325kpa 1.01325bar which is about 14.7 pounds per square inch despite the millibar not being an si unit meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibars as the values are convenient after the advent of si units some meteorologists began using hectopascals symbol hpa which are numerically equivalent to millibars for the same reason the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries for example the weather office of environment canada uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps in contrast americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in us reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic stormsin fresh water there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibars and the change in depth from the water surface in metres specifically an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1.019716m increase in depth in sea water with respect to the gravity variation the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into meters depth according to an empirical formula unesco tech paper 44 p25 as a result decibars are commonly used in oceanographymany engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because in much of their work using pascals would involve using very large numbersengineers that specialize in technical safety for offshore petrochemical facilities would be expected to exclusively refer to explosion loads in units of bar or bars a bar is a convenient unit of measure for pressures generated by low frequency vapor cloud explosions that are commonly considered as part of accidental loading risk studiesin the automotive field turbocharger boost is often described in bars outside the usa tire pressure is often specified in barunicode has characters for mb  u33d4 and bar  u3374 but they exist only for compatibility with legacy asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documentsthe kilobar equivalent to 100mpa is commonly used in geological systems particularly in experimental petrologybara and bara are sometimes used to indicate absolute pressures and barg and barg for gauge pressures this usage is deprecated and fuller descriptions such as gauge pressure of 2 bar or 2 bar gauge are recommended 10dyncm 1mmhg
