list of category 5 atlantic hurricanes  wikipedia a total of 33 recorded tropical cyclones have reached category5 strength on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale in the atlantic ocean north of the equator the caribbean sea and the gulf of mexico hurricanes of such intensity occur once every three years in this region on averageonly six timesin the 1932 1933 1961 2005 2007 and 2017 hurricane seasonshas more than one category5 recorded hurricane formed only in 2005 have more than two category5 hurricanes formed and only in 2007 and 2017 did more than one make landfall at category5 strengtha category5 atlantic hurricane is one that is considered by the united states national hurricane center nhc to have had sustained wind speeds greater than 136 knots 157mph 252kmh 70ms on the saffirsimpson scale the nhc considers sustained wind speeds to be those that occur over a one-minute period at 10 metres 32.8ft above ground these wind speeds are estimated by using a blend of data from a variety of sources which include observations from nearby ships reconnaissance aircraft or automatic weather stations and pictures from various satellitesbetween 1924 and 2017 33 hurricanes were recorded at category5 strength no category5 hurricanes were observed officially before 1924 it can be presumed that earlier storms reached category5 strength over open waters but the strongest winds were not measured the anemometer a device used for measuring wind speed was invented in 1846 however during major hurricane strikes the instruments as a whole were often blown away leaving the hurricanes peak intensity unrecorded for example as the great beaufort hurricane of 1879 struck north carolina the anemometer cups were blown away when indicating 138mph 222kmha reanalysis of weather data is ongoing by researchers who may upgrade or downgrade other atlantic hurricanes currently listed at categories 4 and 5 for example the 1825 santa ana hurricane is suspected to have reached category 5 strength furthermore paleotempestological research aims to identify past major hurricanes by comparing sedimentary evidence of recent and past hurricane strikes for example a giant hurricane significantly more powerful than hurricane hattie category 5 has been identified in belizean sediment having struck the region sometime before 1500officially the decade with the most category5 hurricanes is 20002009 with eight category5 hurricanes having occurred isabel 2003 ivan 2004 emily 2005 katrina 2005 rita 2005 wilma 2005 dean 2007 and felix 2007 the previous decades with the most category5 hurricanes were the 1930s and 1960s with six occurring between 1930 and 1939 before naming begannine atlantic hurricanescamille allen andrew isabel ivan dean felix irma and mariareached category5 intensity on more than one occasion that is by reaching category5 intensity weakening to a category4 or lower and then becoming a category5 again such hurricanes have their dates shown together camille andrew dean felix irma and maria each attained category 5 status twice during their lifespans allen isabel and ivan reached category 5 intensity on three separate occasions however no atlantic hurricane has reached category5 intensity more than three times during its lifespan the november 1932 cuba hurricane holds the record for most time spent as a category5 although it took place before satellite or aircraft reconnaissance so this record may be somewhat suspect irma holds the record for longest continuous span as a category 5 storm in the satellite erathirty-three category5s have been recorded in the atlantic basin since 1851 when records began only one category 5 has been recorded in july eight in august nineteen in september five in october and one in november there have been no officially recorded june or off-season category5 hurricanesthe july and august category5s reached their high intensities in both the gulf of mexico and the caribbean sea these are the areas most favorable for tropical cyclone development in those monthsseptember sees the most category5 hurricanes this coincides with the climatological peak of the atlantic hurricane season which occurs in early september september category5s reached their strengths in any of the gulf of mexico caribbean sea and open atlantic these places are where september tropical cyclones are likely to form many of these hurricanes are either cape verde-type storms which develop their strength by having a great deal of open water or so-called bahama busters which intensify over the warm loop current in the gulf of mexicoall six category5s in october and november reached their intensities in the western caribbean a region that atlantic hurricanes strongly gravitate toward late in the season this is due to the climatology of the area which sometimes has a high-altitude anticyclone that promotes rapid intensification late in the season as well as warm watersall atlantic category5 hurricanes have made landfall at some location at hurricane strength most category5 hurricanes in the atlantic make landfall because of their proximity to land in the caribbean and gulf of mexico where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land as opposed to the westward oceanic mean track of eastern pacific hurricanes sixteen of the storms made landfall while at category5 intensity 2007 and 2017 are the only years in which two storms made landfall at this intensitymany of these systems made landfall shortly after weakening from a category5 this weakening can be caused by dry air near land shallower waters due to shelving interaction with land or cooler waters near shore in southern florida the return period for a category5 hurricane is roughly once every 50 yearsthe following table lists these hurricanes by landfall intensity
