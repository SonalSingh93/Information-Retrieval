biology  wikipedia biology is the natural science that involves the study of life and living organisms including their physical and chemical structure function development and evolution modern biology is a vast field composed of many branches despite the broad scope and the complexity of the science there are certain unifying concepts that consolidate it into a single coherent field in general biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life genes as the basic unit of heredity and evolution as the engine that propels the creation of new species it is also understood that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environmentsub-disciplines of biology are defined by the scale at which life is studied the kinds of organisms studied and the methods used to study them biochemistry examines the rudimentary chemistry of life molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules cellular biology examines the basic building-block of all life the cell physiology examines the physical and chemical functions of tissues organs and organ systems ecology examines how organisms interact in their environment and evolutionary biology examines the processes that produced the diversity of lifethe term biology is derived from the greek word  bios life and the suffix  -logia study of the latin-language form of the term first appeared in 1736 when swedish scientist carl linnaeus carl von linn used biologi in his bibliotheca botanica it was used again in 1766 in a work entitled philosophiae naturalis sive physicae tomus iii continens geologian biologian phytologian generalis by michael christoph hanov a disciple of christian wolff the first german use biologie was in a 1771 translation of linnaeus work in 1797 theodor georg august roose used the term in the preface of a book grundzge der lehre van der lebenskraft karl friedrich burdach used the term in 1800 in a more restricted sense of the study of human beings from a morphological physiological and psychological perspective propdeutik zum studien der gesammten heilkunst the term came into its modern usage with the six-volume treatise biologie oder philosophie der lebenden natur 180222 by gottfried reinhold treviranus who announcedalthough modern biology is a relatively recent development sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times natural philosophy was studied as early as the ancient civilizations of mesopotamia egypt the indian subcontinent and china however the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient greece while the formal study of medicine dates back to hippocrates ca 460 bc  ca 370 bc it was aristotle 384 bc  322 bc who contributed most extensively to the development of biology especially important are his history of animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life aristotles successor at the lyceum theophrastus wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences even into the middle agesscholars of the medieval islamic world who wrote on biology included al-jahiz 781869 al-dnawar 828896 who wrote on botany and rhazes 865925 who wrote on anatomy and physiology medicine was especially well studied by islamic scholars working in greek philosopher traditions while natural history drew heavily on aristotelian thought especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of lifebiology began to quickly develop and grow with anton van leeuwenhoeks dramatic improvement of the microscope it was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa bacteria infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life investigations by jan swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop the basic techniques of microscopic dissection and stainingadvances in microscopy also had a profound impact on biological thinking in the early 19th century a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell then in 1838 schleiden and schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that 1 the basic unit of organisms is the cell and 2 that individual cells have all the characteristics of life although they opposed the idea that 3 all cells come from the division of other cells thanks to the work of robert remak and rudolf virchow however by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theorymeanwhile taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians carl linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 variations of which have been in use ever since and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species georges-louis leclerc comte de buffon treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleableeven suggesting the possibility of common descent though he was opposed to evolution buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought his work influenced the evolutionary theories of both lamarck and darwinserious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of jean-baptiste lamarck who was the first to present a coherent theory of evolution he posited that evolution was the result of environmental stress on properties of animals meaning that the more frequently and rigorously an organ was used the more complex and efficient it would become thus adapting the animal to its environment lamarck believed that these acquired traits could then be passed on to the animals offspring who would further develop and perfect them however it was the british naturalist charles darwin combining the biogeographical approach of humboldt the uniformitarian geology of lyell malthuss writings on population growth and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations who forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection similar reasoning and evidence led alfred russel wallace to independently reach the same conclusions although it was the subject of controversy which continues to this day darwins theory quickly spread through the scientific community and soon became a central axiom of the rapidly developing science of biologythe discovery of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics in the 1940s and early 1950s experiments pointed to dna as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes a focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria along with the discovery of the double helical structure of dna in 1953 marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics from the 1950s to present times biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain the genetic code was cracked by har gobind khorana robert w holley and marshall warren nirenberg after dna was understood to contain codons finally the human genome project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome this project was essentially completed in 2003 with further analysis still being published the human genome project was the first step in a globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organismscell theory states that the cell is the fundamental unit of life that all living things are composed of one or more cells and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division in multicellular organisms every cell in the organisms body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg the cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes in addition the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes that are part of the function known as metabolism finally cells contain hereditary information dna which is passed from cell to cell during cell division research into the origin of life abiogenesis amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cellsa central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution and that all life-forms known have a common origin the theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the earth both living and extinct have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool this universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.5 billion years ago biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria archaea and eukaryotes see origin of lifethe term evolution was introduced into the scientific lexicon by jean-baptiste de lamarck in 1809 and fifty years later charles darwin posited a scientific model of natural selection as evolutions driving force alfred russel wallace is recognized as the co-discoverer of this concept as he helped research and experiment with the concept of evolution evolution is now used to explain the great variations of life found on earthdarwin theorized that species flourish or die when subjected to the processes of natural selection or selective breeding genetic drift was embraced as an additional mechanism of evolutionary development in the modern synthesis of the theorythe evolutionary history of the specieswhich describes the characteristics of the various species from which it descendedtogether with its genealogical relationship to every other species is known as its phylogeny widely varied approaches to biology generate information about phylogeny these include the comparisons of dna sequences a product of molecular biology more particularly genomics and comparisons of fossils or other records of ancient organisms a product of paleontology biologists organize and analyze evolutionary relationships through various methods including phylogenetics phenetics and cladistics for a summary of major events in the evolution of life as currently understood by biologists see evolutionary timelineevolution is relevant to the understanding of the natural history of life forms and to the understanding of the organization of current life forms but those organizations can only be understood in the light of how they came to be by way of the process of evolution consequently evolution is central to all fields of biologygenes are the primary units of inheritance in all organisms a gene is a unit of heredity and corresponds to a region of dna that influences the form or function of an organism in specific ways all organisms from bacteria to animals share the same basic machinery that copies and translates dna into proteins cells transcribe a dna gene into an rna version of the gene and a ribosome then translates the rna into a sequence of amino acids known as a protein the translation code from rna codon to amino acid is the same for most organisms for example a sequence of dna that codes for insulin in humans also codes for insulin when inserted into other organisms such as plantsdna is found as linear chromosomes in eukaryotes and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes a chromosome is an organized structure consisting of dna and histones the set of chromosomes in a cell and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria chloroplasts or other locations is collectively known as a cells genome in eukaryotes genomic dna is localized in the cell nucleus or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts in prokaryotes the dna is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid the genetic information in a genome is held within genes and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotypehomeostasis is the ability of an open system to regulate its internal environment to maintain stable conditions by means of multiple dynamic equilibrium adjustments that are controlled by interrelated regulation mechanisms all living organisms whether unicellular or multicellular exhibit homeostasisto maintain dynamic equilibrium and effectively carry out certain functions a system must detect and respond to perturbations after the detection of a perturbation a biological system normally responds through negative feedback that stabilize conditions by reducing or increasing the activity of an organ or system one example is the release of glucagon when sugar levels are too lowthe survival of a living organism depends on the continuous input of energy chemical reactions that are responsible for its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them in this process molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles first they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organisms biological chemical reactions second food can be transformed into new molecular structures biomolecules that are of use to that organismthe organisms responsible for the introduction of energy into an ecosystem are known as producers or autotrophs nearly all such organisms originally draw their energy from the sun plants and other phototrophs use solar energy via a process known as photosynthesis to convert raw materials into organic molecules such as atp whose bonds can be broken to release energy a few ecosystems however depend entirely on energy extracted by chemotrophs from methane sulfides or other non-luminal energy sourcessome of the energy thus captured produces biomass and energy that is available for growth and development of other life forms the majority of the rest of this biomass and energy are lost as waste molecules and heat the most important processes for converting the energy trapped in chemical substances into energy useful to sustain life are metabolism and cellular respirationmolecular biology is the study of biology at the molecular level this field overlaps with other areas of biology particularly those of genetics and biochemistry molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell including the interrelationships of dna rna and protein synthesis and how those interactions are regulatedthe next larger scale cell biology studies the structural and physiological properties of cells including their internal behavior interactions with other cells and with their environment this is done on both the microscopic and molecular levels for unicellular organisms such as bacteria as well as the specialized cells of multicellular organisms such as humans understanding the structure and function of cells is fundamental to all of the biological sciences the similarities and differences between cell types are particularly relevant to molecular biologyanatomy is a treatment of the macroscopic forms of such structures organs and organ systemsgenetics is the science of genes heredity and the variation of organisms genes encode the information needed by cells for the synthesis of proteins which in turn play a central role in influencing the final phenotype of the organism genetics provides research tools used in the investigation of the function of a particular gene or the analysis of genetic interactions within organisms genetic information is physically represented as chromosomes within which it is represented by a particular sequence of amino acids in particular dna moleculesdevelopmental biology studies the process by which organisms grow and develop developmental biology originated from embryology studies the genetic control of cell growth cellular differentiation and cellular morphogenesis which is the process that progressively gives rise to tissues organs and anatomy model organisms for developmental biology include the round worm caenorhabditis elegans the fruit fly drosophila melanogaster the zebrafish danio rerio the mouse mus musculus and the weed arabidopsis thaliana a model organism is a species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena with the expectation that discoveries made in that organism provide insight into the workings of other organismsphysiology is the study of the mechanical physical and biochemical processes of living organisms function as a whole the theme of structure to function is central to biology physiological studies have traditionally been divided into plant physiology and animal physiology but some principles of physiology are universal no matter what particular organism is being studied for example what is learned about the physiology of yeast cells can also apply to human cells the field of animal physiology extends the tools and methods of human physiology to non-human species plant physiology borrows techniques from both research fieldsphysiology is the study the interaction of how for example the nervous immune endocrine respiratory and circulatory systems function and interact the study of these systems is shared with such medically oriented disciplines as neurology and immunologyevolutionary research is concerned with the origin and descent of species and their change over time it employs scientists from many taxonomically oriented disciplines for example those with special training in particular organisms such as mammalogy ornithology botany or herpetology but are of use in answering more general questions about evolutionevolutionary biology is partly based on paleontology which uses the fossil record to answer questions about the mode and tempo of evolution and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics in the 1980s developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology phylogenetics systematics and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biologymultiple speciation events create a tree structured system of relationships between species the role of systematics is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species however systematics was an active field of research long before evolutionary thinking was commontraditionally living things have been divided into five kingdoms monera protista fungi plantae animalia however many scientists now consider this five-kingdom system outdated modern alternative classification systems generally begin with the three-domain system archaea originally archaebacteria bacteria originally eubacteria and eukaryota including protists fungi plants and animals these domains reflect whether the cells have nuclei or not as well as differences in the chemical composition of key biomolecules such as ribosomesfurther each kingdom is broken down recursively until each species is separately classified the order is domain kingdom phylum class order family genus speciesoutside of these categories there are obligate intracellular parasites that are on the edge of life in terms of metabolic activity meaning that many scientists do not actually classify such structures as alive due to their lack of at least one or more of the fundamental functions or characteristics that define life they are classified as viruses viroids prions or satellitesthe scientific name of an organism is generated from its genus and species for example humans are listed as homo sapiens homo is the genus and sapiens the species when writing the scientific name of an organism it is proper to capitalize the first letter in the genus and put all of the species in lowercase additionally the entire term may be italicized or underlinedthe dominant classification system is called the linnaean taxonomy it includes ranks and binomial nomenclature how organisms are named is governed by international agreements such as the international code of nomenclature for algae fungi and plants icn the international code of zoological nomenclature iczn and the international code of nomenclature of bacteria icnb the classification of viruses viroids prions and all other sub-viral agents that demonstrate biological characteristics is conducted by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv and is known as the international code of viral classification and nomenclature icvcn however several other viral classification systems do exista merging draft biocode was published in 1997 in an attempt to standardize nomenclature in these three areas but has yet to be formally adopted the biocode draft has received little attention since 1997 its originally planned implementation date of january 1 2000 has passed unnoticed a revised biocode that instead of replacing the existing codes would provide a unified context for them was proposed in 2011 however the international botanical congress of 2011 declined to consider the biocode proposal the icvcn remains outside the biocode which does not include viral classificationanimalia  bos primigenius taurusplantae  triticumfungi  morchella esculentastramenopilachromista  fucus serratusbacteria  gemmatimonas aurantiaca -  1 micrometerarchaea  halobacteriavirus  gamma phageecology is the study of the distribution and abundance of living organisms the interaction between them and their environment an organism shares an environment that includes other organisms and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors non-living such as climate and ecology one reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with other organisms and the environment are possible even on small scales a microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the african savanna for any species behaviors can be co-operative competitive parasitic or symbiotic matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystemecological systems are studied at several different levels from the scale of the ecology of individual organisms to those of populations to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere the term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases viruses and microbes while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals ecology draws on many subdisciplinesethology is the study of animal behavior particularly that of social animals such as primates and canids and is sometimes considered a branch of zoology ethologists have been particularly concerned with the evolution of behavior and the understanding of behavior in terms of the theory of natural selection in one sense the first modern ethologist was charles darwin whose book the expression of the emotions in man and animals influenced many ethologists to comebiogeography studies the spatial distribution of organisms on the earth focusing on such topics as plate tectonics climate change dispersal and migration and cladisticsdespite the profound advances made over recent decades in our understanding of lifes fundamental processes some basic problems have remained unresolved one of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination one view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity see references eg an alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate dna repair in germ-line dna and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run see also evolution of sexual reproductionanother basic unresolved problem in biology is the biologic basis of aging at present there is no consensus view on the underlying cause of aging various competing theories are outlined in ageing theoriesthese are the main branches of biology for a more detailed list see outline of biology
