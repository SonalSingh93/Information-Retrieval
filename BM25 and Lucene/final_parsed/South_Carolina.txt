to intimidate and terrorize black voters they regained political control of the state under conservative white redeemers and pro-business bourbon democrats in 1877 the federal government withdrew its troops as part of the compromise of 1877 that ended reconstructionthe state became a hotbed of racial and economic tensions during the populist and agrarian movements of the 1890s a republican-populist biracial coalition took power away from white democrats temporarily to prevent that from happening again democrats gained passage of a new constitution in 1895 that effectively disfranchised almost all blacks and many poor whites by new requirements for poll taxes residency and literacy tests that dramatically reduced the voter rolls by 1896 only 5,500 black voters remained on the voter registration rolls although they constituted a majority of the states population the 1900 census demonstrated the extent of disenfranchisement the 782,509 african american citizens comprised more than 58% of the states population but they were essentially without any political representation in the jim crow societythe 1895 constitution overturned local representative government reducing the role of the counties to agents of state government effectively ruled by the general assembly through the legislative delegations for each county as each county had one state senator that person had considerable power the counties lacked representative government until home rule was passed in 1975governor pitchfork ben tillman a populist led the effort to disenfranchise the blacks and poor whites although he controlled democratic state politics from the 1890s to 1910 with a base among poor white farmers during the constitutional convention in 1895 he supported another mans proposal that the state adopt a one-drop rule as well as prohibit marriage between whites and anyone with any known african ancestrysome members of the convention realized that prominent white families with some african ancestry could be affected by such legislation in terms similar to a debate in virginia in 1853 on a similar proposal which was dropped george dionysius tillman said the following in oppositionif the law is made as it now stands respectable families in aiken barnwell colleton and orangeburg will be denied the right to intermarry among people with whom they are now associated and identified at least one hundred families would be affected to my knowledge they have sent good soldiers to the confederate army and are now landowners and taxpayers those men served creditably and it would be unjust and disgraceful to embarrass them in this way it is a scientific fact that there is not one full-blooded caucasian on the floor of this convention every member has in him a certain mixture of colored blood the pure-blooded white has needed and received a certain infusion of darker blood to give him readiness and purpose it would be a cruel injustice and the source of endless litigation of scandal horror feud and bloodshed to undertake to annul or forbid marriage for a remote perhaps obsolete trace of negro blood the doors would be open to scandal malice and greed to statements on the witness stand that the father or grandfather or grandmother had said that a or b had negro blood in their veins any man who is half a man would be ready to blow up half the world with dynamite to prevent or avenge attacks upon the honor of his mother in the legitimacy or purity of the blood of his fatherthe state postponed such a one-drop law for years virginian legislators adopted a one-drop law in 1924 forgetting that their state had many people of mixed ancestry among those who identified as whiteearly in the 20th century south carolina developed a thriving textile

barrier islands the border between the low country and the up country is defined by the atlantic seaboard fall line which marks the limit of navigable riversthe states coastline contains many salt marshes and estuaries as well as natural ports such as georgetown and charleston an unusual feature of the coastal plain is a large number of carolina bays the origins of which are uncertain the bays tend to be oval lining up in a northwest to southeast orientation the terrain is flat and the soil is composed entirely of recent sediments such as sand silt and clay areas with better drainage make excellent farmland though some land is swampy the natural areas of the coastal plain are part of the middle atlantic coastal forests ecoregionjust west of the coastal plain is the sandhills region the sandhills are remnants of coastal dunes from a time when the land was sunken or the oceans were higherthe upstate region contains the roots of an ancient eroded mountain chain it is generally hilly with thin stony clay soils and contains few areas suitable for farming much of the piedmont was once farmed due to the changing economics of farming much of the land is now reforested in loblolly pine for the lumber industry these forests are part of the southeastern mixed forests ecoregion at the southeastern edge of the piedmont is the fall line where rivers drop to the coastal plain the fall line was an important early source of water power mills built to harness this resource encouraged the growth of several cities including the capital columbia the larger rivers are navigable up to the
