rotational symmetry  wikipedia rotational symmetry also known as radial symmetry in biology is the property a shape has when it looks the same after some rotation by a partial turn an objects degree of rotational symmetry is the number of distinct orientations in which it looks the sameformally the rotational symmetry is symmetry with respect to some or all rotations in m-dimensional euclidean space rotations are direct isometries ie isometries preserving orientation therefore a symmetry group of rotational symmetry is a subgroup of em see euclidean groupsymmetry with respect to all rotations about all points implies translational symmetry with respect to all translations so space is homogeneous and the symmetry group is the whole em with the modified notion of symmetry for vector fields the symmetry group can also be emfor symmetry with respect to rotations about a point we can take that point as origin these rotations form the special orthogonal group som the group of mm orthogonal matrices with determinant 1 for  this is the rotation group so3in another meaning of the word the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within en the group of direct isometries in other words the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries for chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry grouplaws of physics are so3-invariant if they do not distinguish different directions in space because of noethers theorem rotational symmetry of a physical system is equivalent to the angular momentum conservation lawrotational symmetry of ordern also called n-fold rotational symmetry or discrete rotational symmetry of the nth order with respect to a particular point in 2d or axis in 3d means that rotation by an angle of 360n 180 120 90 72 60 51 etc does not change the object note that 1-fold symmetry is no symmetry all objects look alike after a rotation of 360the notation for n-fold symmetry is cn or simply n the actual symmetry group is specified by the point or axis of symmetry together with the n for each point or axis of symmetry the abstract group type is cyclic group of ordern zn although for the latter also the notation cn is used the geometric and abstract cn should be distinguished there are other symmetry groups of the same abstract group type which are geometrically different see cyclic symmetry groups in 3dthe fundamental domain is a sector of 360nexamples without additional reflection symmetrycn is the rotation group of a regular n-sided polygon in 2d and of a regular n-sided pyramid in 3dif there is eg rotational symmetry with respect to an angle of 100 then also with respect to one of 20 the greatest common divisor of 100 and 360a typical 3d object with rotational symmetry possibly also with perpendicular axes but no mirror symmetry is a propellerfor discrete symmetry with multiple symmetry axes through the same point there are the following possibilitiesin the case of the platonic solids the 2-fold axes are through the midpoints of opposite edges and the number of them is half the number of edges the other axes are through opposite vertices and through centers of opposite faces except in the case of the tetrahedron where the 3-fold axes are each through one vertex and the center of one facerotational symmetry with respect to any angle is in two dimensions circular symmetry the fundamental domain is a half-linein three dimensions we can distinguish cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry no change when rotating about one axis or for any rotation that is no dependence on the angle using cylindrical coordinates and no dependence on either angle using spherical coordinates the fundamental domain is a half-plane through the axis and a radial half-line respectively axisymmetric or axisymmetrical are adjectives which refer to an object having cylindrical symmetry or axisymmetry an example of approximate spherical symmetry is the earth with respect to density and other physical and chemical propertiesin 4d continuous or discrete rotational symmetry about a plane corresponds to corresponding 2d rotational symmetry in every perpendicular plane about the point of intersection an object can also have rotational symmetry about two perpendicular planes eg if it is the cartesian product of two rotationally symmetry 2d figures as in the case of eg the duocylinder and various regular duoprisms2-fold rotational symmetry together with single translational symmetry is one of the frieze groups there are two rotocenters per primitive celltogether with double translational symmetry the rotation groups are the following wallpaper groups with axes per primitive cellscaling of a lattice divides the number of points per unit area by the square of the scale factor therefore the number of 2- 3- 4- and 6-fold rotocenters per primitive cell is 4 3 2 and 1 respectively again including 4-fold as a special case of 2-fold etc3-fold rotational symmetry at one point and 2-fold at another one or ditto in 3d with respect to parallel axes implies rotation group p6 ie double translational symmetry and 6-fold rotational symmetry at some point or in 3d parallel axis the translation distance for the symmetry generated by one such pair of rotocenters is 23 times their distance
