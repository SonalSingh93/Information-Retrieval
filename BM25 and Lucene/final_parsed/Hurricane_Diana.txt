hurricane diana  wikipedia hurricane diana was the deadliest tropical cyclone during the 1990 atlantic hurricane season killing 139 people in mexico forming out of a tropical wave on august4 the system brushed honduras before intensifying into a tropical storm the following day gradually gaining strength diana struck the yucatn peninsula with winds of 65mph 100kmh due land interaction the cyclone weakened slightly before moving over the warm waters of the bay of campeche on august6 once over water the diana quickly became a hurricane and later reached its peak intensity on august7 as a category2 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale shortly thereafter the storm made landfall near tampico tamaulipas with winds of 100mph 165kmh rapid weakening ensued once the storm moved over the high terrain of mexico and diana diminished to a tropical depression roughly 24hours after moving onshore the cyclone later emerged into the gulf of california on august9 before dissipating though its remnants were monitored until august14 when the system lost its identity over arizonathroughout mexico hurricane diana produced torrential rains that triggered deadly flooding and landslides roughly 155mi 400km of farmland was destroyed and 30,000 people were left homeless by the storm numerous roads and railways were either washed out or blocked by debris cutting communication with several communities in all 139 people were killed in the country and 90million 1990usd was wrought in damage due to the extensive loss of life and damage caused by the storm the name diana was retired the following year and replaced with dolly which was first used in the 1996 seasonthe origins of hurricane diana were from a tropical wave that existed western africa into the atlantic on july 27 conditions were unfavorable for development of a tropical cyclone and the tropical wave remained disorganized until reaching the eastern caribbean sea the system entered the caribbean sea through the southern windward islands where falling barometric pressures were observed decreasing by 3.5mbar hpa 0.1inhg in 24 hours upper-level air data from the lesser antilles indicated that the tropical wave was associated with an upper-level anticyclone with increasing convection the first air force reconnaissance plane flight indicated no low-level circulation but a relatively large amount of thunderstorm activity the system continued to have a large amount of associated convection while passing over the netherlands antilles as indicated by satellite images and surface observations cyclonic rotation was observed in the low-level convection by satellite images and the fifth tropical depression of the season had developed at 0000 utc on august 4 situated in the southwestern caribbean sea however this was based on surface observations and it was not confirmed that tropical cyclone formation occurred until later that daythe new tropical depression moved to the northwest under the influence of a mid-level trough and rapidly intensified to a tropical storm the following day offshore of eastern honduras the national hurricane center assigned the name diana to the system becoming a tropical storm diana further intensified and winds reached 65mph 105kmh before landfall in felipe carrillo puerto in quintana roo occurred the storm initially rapidly weakened over land although it retained winds of 50mph 80kmh until moving over open waters when diana entered the southern gulf of mexico the trough of low pressure in that vicinity weakened and steering currents caused the storm to head westward conditions became more favorable in the gulf of mexico and diana quickly intensified becoming a hurricane late on august 7 hurricane diana rapidly intensified and briefly reached category 2 hurricane status attaining peak intensity with winds of 100mph 165kmh and a minimum barometric pressure of 980mbar hpa 28.94inhg only two hours after attaining peak intensity on august 7 hurricane diana made landfall near tampico tamaulipas at the same intensitymoving inland diana rapidly weakened over the high terrain of mexico quickly deteriorating from a low-end category 2 hurricane to a strong tropical storm within four hours diana continued westward over mexico and weakened to a tropical depression on august 8 while centered near mexico city the weakening tropical depression turned west-northwestward over central mexico and emerged into the pacific ocean on august 9 before dissipating in the gulf of california the remnants of hurricane diana curved northward and tracked through the gulf of california and eventually came ashore in northwestern sonora crossing northwestern mexico the remnants of diana entered arizona and quickly dissipatedin anticipation of dianas first landfall a tropical storm warning was issued on august5 for cancn mexico southward to belize city belize on august5 including the offshore islands from both nations a tropical storm warning indicates that tropical storm force winds 39 to 73mph 39 to 118kmh are expected within 24hours eleven hours later the tropical storm warning was extended as far as carmen but was discontinued for the entire east coast of belize residents along coastal areas of quintana roo were advised to evacuate inland as tides were expected to range from 3 to 5ft 0.91 to 1.52m above normal emergency officials set up shelters were set up in xcalak punta herrero and punta allen the mexican coast guard was placed on alert and shipping across quantana roo was suspended during the evening of august5 additionally there were concerns about flash flooding due to the possibility of 5 to 8in 130 to 200mm of rainfall in areas near the storms path after diana made landfall on the yucatn peninsula on august 6 all of the tropical storm warnings in place were discontinueddiana then threatened the mainland east coast of mexico a hurricane watch was issued for tuxpan to boca de jesus maria at 21:00utc on august6 a hurricane watch notes the possibility of hurricane conditions within 48 hours such as winds of at least 74mph 119kmh early on august 7 the national hurricane center anticipated hurricane conditions within 24 hours and as a result a hurricane warning was issued for nautla to le pesca simultaneously a tropical storm warning was issued for la pesca to boca de jesus maria later that day a hurricane warning had been issued for a similar area stretching from nautla to lerdo de tejada the national hurricane center also predicted precipitation totals of 8in 200mm and emphasized that flash floods and mudslides would likely occurred in the vicinity of where diana was projected to make landfall according to miguelangel rebolledo the captain of the port of tuxpan about 300people fled low-lying areas state and federal officials prepared 10,000packages of emergency supplies food and medicine and moved them to several locations along the coast police and armed forces were placed on alert by 00:00utc on august8 all of the watches and warnings in place were officially discontinuedoffshore quintana roo the island cozumel of reported sustained winds of 45mph 75kmh while crossing

roorough seas were reported mainly between coatzacoalcos and tampico the ports of those two cities were closed during the passage of diana according to the servicio meteorolgico nacional while passing through the bay of campeche and the southern gulf of mexico diana produced waves up to 12ft 3.6m in height on mainland mexico the states of veracruz hidalgo and puebla were hardest hit with over 75,000 people affected by the hurricane in poza rica high winds toppled trees and electricity poles which cut off telephone services and electricity supply to the city fallen trees and telephone wires
