hurricane connie  wikipedia hurricane connie in august 1955 contributed to significant flooding across the eastern united states just days before hurricane diane affected the same general area connie formed on august3 from a tropical wave in the eastern atlantic ocean it moved quickly west-northwestward strengthening into a well-developed hurricane by august5 initially it posed a threat to the lesser antilles although it passed about 50mi 80km north of the region the outer rainbands produced hurricane-force wind gusts and intense precipitation reaching 8.65in 220mm in puerto rico in the united states virgin islands three people died due to the hurricane and a few homes were destroyed in puerto rico connie destroyed 60homes and caused crop damage after affecting puerto rico connie turned to the northwest reaching peak winds of 140mph 220kmh the hurricane weakened while slowing and turning to the north and struck north carolina on august12 at category 2 intensity the first of three damaging tropical cyclones in the 1955 atlantic hurricane season to hit the stateahead of the storm the united states weather bureau issued widespread hurricane warnings resulting in 14,000people evacuating southeastern north carolina connie produced strong winds high tides and heavy rainfall as it moved ashore causing heavy crop damage and 27deaths in the state connie tracked roughly along the eastern coast of virginia before turning northwest and it progressed inland until dissipating on august15 near sault ste marie michigan four people were killed in washington dc due to a traffic accident in chesapeake bay connie capsized a boat killing 14people and prompting a change in coast guard regulation there were six deaths each in pennsylvania and new jersey and eleven deaths in new york where record rainfall flooded homes and subways at least 225,000people lost power during the storm damage in the united states totaled around 86million although the rains from connie contributed to flooding from hurricane diane that caused 700million in damage the remnants of connie destroyed a few houses and boats in ontario and killed three people in ontarioa tropical wave developed into a tropical cyclone on august3 to the west of the cape verde islands based on reports from two ships it moved rapidly to the west-northwest quickly intensifying into tropical storm connie a hurricane hunters flight on august4 reported a developing eye feature and the next day connie rapidly strengthened into a 125mph 201kmh major hurricane on august6 it passed about 60mi 97km north of the lesser antilles and puerto rico by that time connie had attained peak winds of 140mph 230kmh making it a category4 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scalefor four days connie maintained its peak intensity as its track shifted from the west-northwest toward the northwest passing to the northeast of the bahamas as it rounded a large ridge on august7 its eye had decreased to a diameter of 7mi 11km by august10 the eye had lost its definition as connie slowed its northwest track it began a west-northwest drift due to slight fujiwhara interaction with developing hurricane diane to its southeast as well as a building ridge to its northeast the hurricane turned to the north on august11 and was steadily weakening due to the combination of upwelling and entrainment of cool air connie turned toward the north-northeast on august12 by which time it had weakened to a minimal hurricanelate on august12 hurricane connie made landfall near fort macon state park in north carolina according to the atlantic hurricane database connie moved ashore as a category 2 hurricane with winds of 100mph 160kmh although the hurricane research division initially suggested that the hurricane hit north carolina with winds of at least 115mph 185kmh but those reports were found to be too high in reanalysis connie briefly moved offshore before striking land again near cape charles along the eastern shore of virginia it progressed inland weakening to a tropical storm over virginia and moving northward through the chesapeake bay connie turned to the northwest passing through much of pennsylvania before weakening to a tropical depression near the pennsylvanianew york border after crossing lake ontario and southwestern ontario the system moved through lake huron dissipating on august 15 near sault ste marie michiganon august5 hurricane connie began to become an apparent threat to the northeastern caribbean islands with maximum winds in the storm reaching 125mph 205kmh the national weather bureau issued hurricane warnings for barbuda saba and antigua the virgin islands and puerto rico were placed on hurricane alert as warnings were possible later that day after connie affected puerto rico a storm warning was issued for the northern coast of the dominican republic and a hurricane warning was issued for the eastern bahamaswhile connie was meandering in the western atlantic ocean its potential track posed problems for forecasters on august7 a hurricane warning was issued from north carolina to norfolk virginia with a hurricane alert further north to new york city the weather bureau later extended the hurricane warnings to delaware breakwater with storm warnings further northeast to provincetown massachusetts the alert for north carolina was up for about three days until connie moved inlandahead of the storm the united states military flew planes away from the coast to safer shelters further inland two people were killed when they crashed the navy plane they were evacuating naval ships rode out the storm at sea while small boats were secured at port the american red cross opened shelters and mobilized 41officials with experience in hurricanes the coast guard ordered four towns along beaches to evacuate and overall about 14,000people evacuated the coastline some to the 79red cross shelters opened up about 2,000people evacuated from flood-prone areas in new bern north carolina in philadelphia the boy scouts evacuated 800scouts from camp delmont due to the threat of the hurricane the threat of connie also canceled a flight by president dwight eisenhower from gettysburg to washington dc prompting him to travel instead by car residents were also evacuated in coastal portions of new jerseyas the hurricane passed about 50mi 80km north of the lesser antilles the outer rainbands of connie produced wind gusts as high as 104mph 166kmh on tortola in the british virgin islands wind gusts reached 46mph 74kmh in puerto rico and the united states virgin islands although there were estimates of 80mph 130kmh wind gusts on saint thomas the outer rainbands of connie also produced heavy rainfall in the northeastern caribbean the highest precipitation total in puerto rico was 8.65in 220mm along the lower ro blanco of which 7.50in 191mm fell in one day rainfall reached 7.04in 179mm in charlotte amalie on saint thomas two people drowned on the island and one person was electrocuted due to connies passage the hurricane also destroyed a few shacks and boats on saint thomas along the northern coast of puerto rico the threat of connie forced 40,000people to evacuate their homes high waves and other impact from the storm destroyed 60poorly-built houses connie also damaged crops and utilities in puerto ricoas connie struck north carolina it produced sustained winds of 72mph 116kmh in morehead city with gusts to 83mph 134kmh wind gusts near where the hurricane moved ashore reached 100mph 160kmh although it was not confirmed whether the gust was estimated or measured frying pan shoals offshore the state reported a gust of 92mph 148kmh along connies western periphery the rainbands spawned at least six tornadoes of which five in south carolina and one in north carolina the hurricane produced tides that were up to 8ft 2.4m above normal while moving slowly ashore which resulted in significant beach erosion tides were higher at swansboro north carolina than during hurricane hazel the previous october and many piers that were rebuilt after hazel were damaged or destroyed by connie the storm surge flooded low-lying portions of wilmington and destroyed 40buildings in myrtle beach south carolina high waves in advance of the storm flooded coastal roads along the outer banks rainfall amounts of over 10in 250mm in the area west of where connie made landfall stream flooding occurred as far inland as raleigh but was most significant near the coast along the pamlico river in washington national guardsmen were ordered to help about 1,000people evacuate during the storm outer rainbands knocked out power lines in coastal north carolina and flooding-induced rainfall closed us route 17 near new bern throughout north carolina the hurricane caused about 40million in damage of which about 75% was from crop damage there were 27deaths in the state related to connie including traffic deaths drownings people in damaged buildings and electrocutions damage was minimal in myrtle beach south carolinahurricane-force winds extended into virginia in the state severe river flooding was reported from the coast inland to richmond which caused localized damage ten stations in the state and sixteen in neighboring maryland reached the highest stage on record as connie progressed northward it continued to drop significant amounts of precipitation totals of over 10in 250mm were reported on both sides of the chesapeake bay in pennsylvania and in southeastern new york rainfall in richmond virginia totaled 8.79in 223mm on august12 breaking the days precipitation record record rainfall also occurred in philadelphia and new york city the highest precipitation related to connie was 13.24in 336mm at fort schuyler in new york rainfall also extended as far west as michigan and as far east as maine across the northeastern united states high rainfall from the hurricane resulted in disastrous flooding along with diane which moved ashore four days after connie this was due to unusually moist air across the region which resulted from above average water and air temperatures many areas were in drought conditions before the flooding the combination of strong winds and high waves quickly wrecked a 125ft 38m schooner in the chesapeake bay capsizing near fairhaven maryland the boat named the levin j marvel was 64years old and was described as unseaworthy when it left from annapolis maryland of the 23passengers and four crew members 14people drowned making it one of the worst maritime calamities in the history of tidewater maryland as described by the baltimore sun the other passengers were later rescued some of whom after holding onto wreckagein virginia flooding washed out a portion of the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad near lankford and covered portions of us 1 and us 301 the storm downed trees and caused scattered power outages for at least 5,000people in the state in washington dc a car accident caused by slick roads resulted in the death of four people after a car was sideswiped and knocked into a swollen creek where the occupants drowned in delaware the rains caused flooding that was described as inconsequential by the united states geological survey due to preceding drought conditions rainfall reached 9in 230mm in southeastern pennsylvania causing flooding that entered basements in low-lying areas and covered roads two people drowned after floods swept away their cars there were six deaths in the state and also six deaths in neighboring new jersey hurricane connie brought the heaviest rain seen in new york in over 50 years during its passage dropping 5.32in 135mm in new york city within a 20-hour span large areas of the city including subways and thousands of houses were flooded and about 100,000people were left without power between new york and new jersey about 225,000people lost power high winds and tides from the storm caused the cancellation of ferry service and forced laguardia airport to temporarily shut down after it was flooded 1ft 0.30m deep the rains caused heavy damage across southeastern new york and 11people were killed across the state in coastal connecticut the rainfall from connie increased levels along streams but there was little damage overall damage in the united states was estimated at about 86,065,000 mostly in north carolina virginia and marylandfurther inland gusts from connie reached 65mph 105kmh along lake huron in michigan which caused high waves that damaged or sank many small boats damage in the state was estimated at 150,000 before connie affected canada residents in humber valley prepared for potential evacuations after hurricane hazel in the previous october produced deadly flooding when the remnants of connie entered ontario as a tropical depression on august 14 it continued to produce winds of up to 46mph 75kmh and the storm dropped 2.56in 65mm of rainfall near the great lakes in burlington 27boats were destroyed and one person drowned in lake erie after his boat sank two other people drowned in the province connie destroyed six houses and damaged several others due to high waves the storm also caused power outages and damage to the tobacco cropflooding caused by connie generally did not attract much media attention however the floods were important in setting the conditions for later significant flooding across the northeastern united states just five days after connie struck north carolina hurricane diane affected the same area but instead of continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from connie damage from diane totaled at least 700million and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes impact this allowed federal assistance for the affected areasthe loss of the levin j marvel during the hurricane prompted the united states congress to pass a law in 1956 which allowed the coast guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700tons greatly higher than the 183tons that the marvel weighed a federal courthouse charged the inexperienced captain with negligence giving him a one-year probationdue to its destructive impacts the name connie was retired and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane
