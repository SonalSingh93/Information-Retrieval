hurricane maria  wikipedia hurricane maria is regarded as the worst natural disaster on record in dominica and caused catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis in puerto rico the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record maria was the thirteenth named storm seventh consecutive hurricane fourth major hurricane and the second category5 hurricane of the hyperactive 2017 atlantic hurricane season at its peak the hurricane caused catastrophic damage and numerous fatalities across the northeastern caribbean compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the leeward islands already struck by hurricane irma just two weeks prior maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the leeward islands in two weeks after irma made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and hurricane jose passed dangerously close bringing tropical storm force winds to barbudaoriginating from a tropical wave maria became a tropical storm on september 16 east of the lesser antilles highly favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc the hurricane reached category5 strength on september 18 upon making landfall on dominica producing extreme winds across the entire island afterwards maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175mph 280kmh and a pressure of 908mbar hpa 26.81inhg making it the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane on record weakening slightly but retaining its ferocious winds maria struck puerto rico as a high-end category4 hurricane on september 20 interaction with land weakened the hurricane though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the bahamas moving slowly to the north maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on september 28 embedded in the westerlies maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open atlantic becoming extratropical on september 30 and dissipating by october 3as of november 13 at least 129people are confirmed to have been killed by the hurricane 55 in puerto rico 57 in dominica 5 in the dominican republic 4 in the contiguous united states 3 in haiti 2 in guadeloupe and 3 in the united states virgin islands dozens of others mostly in dominica and puerto rico are still missing san juan mayor yuln cruz claimed that the actual death toll in puerto rico may actually be as high as 500 maria wrought catastrophic damage to the entirety of dominica which suffered an island-wide communication blackout much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair while the islands lush vegetation had been practically eradicated the islands of guadeloupe and martinique endured widespread flooding damaged roofs and uprooted trees puerto rico suffered catastrophic damage including destruction of its previously damaged electrical grid for weeks in marias wake most of the islands population suffered from flooding and lack of resources compounded by the slow relief process total losses from the hurricane are estimated at between 15.9 and 95 billion 2017 usd mostly in puerto rico making marias cost comparable to that of previous hurricanes irma and harveythe national hurricane center nhc began monitoring two tropical waves on september 13 the easternmost wave quickly spun up into what would become hurricane lee while the western one continued moving generally westward with generally favorable conditions in the disturbances path development into a tropical cyclone seemed likely during those two days the disturbance became better organized and by september 16 convective banding became established around a poorly organized circulation as the system was an imminent threat to land despite the center not being well-defined the nhc initiated advisories on it as potential tropical cyclone fifteen at 15:00utc in accordance with a policy change enacted at the start of the season a mid-level ridge anchored north of the disturbance steered it generally west-northwest into a region highly favorable for further development sea surface temperatures of 84f 29c low wind shear and ample moisture were anticipated to foster strengthening to hurricane-status before the system reached the lesser antilles as the disturbance continued to grow increasingly well-defined throughout the day it was later upgraded to a moderate-range tropical storm  based on satellite estimates  at 21:00utc that day receiving the name maria at that time maria was situated 620mi 1,000km east-southeast of the lesser antillesa central dense overcast and favorable outflow developed atop the center of circulation which enabled maria to become further organized throughout the early morning hours of september 17 after a brief intrusion of dry air exposed the circulation a convective burst occurred over the center and intensification resumed hurricane hunters investigating the system observed surface winds of 74mph 119kmh and a formative eye feature accordingly the nhc upgraded maria to hurricane status at 21:00utc expansion of the central dense overcast and an increasingly complete eyewall signaled steady intensification throughout the overnight of september1718 considerable lightning activity was identified within the hurricanes core early on september 18 and statistical models indicated a high probability of rapid intensification explosive strengthening took place shortly thereafter with aircraft reconnaissance finding surface winds of 120mph 195kmh and a central pressure of 959mbar hpa 28.32inhg making maria a category3 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale and hence a major hurricane additionally radar data revealed a well-defined 12mi 19km wide eye the eye contracted slightly to 9mi 14km as intensification continued and the system reached category4 strength by 21:00utcrapid intensification culminated late on september 18 with maria achieving category5 status just 15mi 25km east-southeast of dominica hurricane hunters observed surface winds of 160mph 260kmh and a pressure of 925mbar hpa 27.32inhg at this time maria made landfall in dominica at 01:15utc on september 19 becoming the first category5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation interaction with the mountains of dominica imparted slight weakening of the hurricane to category4 however once over the caribbean sea maria regained category5 intensity additional strengthening took place as the storm tracked northwest toward puerto rico despite the formation of concentric eyewallsthe larger one spanning 25 to 35mi 40 to 56km and the smaller only 5mi 8.0km signalling the start of an eyewall replacement cyclethe inner violent core remained undisrupted through the afternoon maria attained its peak intensity around 04:00utc on september 20 roughly 30mi 45km south of st croix sustained winds reached 175mph 280kmh and its central pressure bottomed out at 908mbar hpa 26.85inhg this ranks it as the tenth-most intense atlantic hurricane since reliable records beganthe hurricane made its closest approach to st croix around 05:00utc on september 20 passing within 20mi 30km of the island the storms outer eyewall lashed the island while the more violent inner eye remained offshore hours later around 08:00utc the outer eyewall struck vieques an island off the eastern coast of puerto rico by this time the outer eye became dominant as the inner one decayed and the eyewall replacement cycle caused maria to weaken to category4 strength maria made landfall just south of yabucoa puerto rico around 10:15utc with sustained winds of 155mph 250kmh making it the strongest to hit the island since the 1928 san felipe segundo hurricane maria maintained a general west-northwest course across puerto rico emerging over the atlantic ocean shortly before 18:00utc interaction with the mountainous terrain resulted in substantial weakening sustained winds fell to 110mph 175kmh and the central pressure rose to 957mbars hpa 28.26inhg with favorable environmental conditions maria steadily reorganized as it moved away from puerto rico a large eye 45mi 75km wide developed with deep convection blossoming around it early on september 21 the system regained category3 intensityinitially cooler waters stirred up by hurricane irma two weeks prior limited marias reorganization during the afternoon of september 21 the system traversed the navidad and silver banks north of the dominican republic shoaling from the regions shallow waters temporarily interfered with measurements of surface winds convection around the storms eye deepened and its eye became better defined that night and the hurricane reached a tertiary peak with sustained winds of 125mph 205kmh an increase in southwesterly wind shear prompted gradual weakening of the hurricane starting with restriction of banding features and later degradation of the eyewall late on september 22 the hurricane turned north-northwest as it reached the western periphery of the ridge previously steering it northwest maria fluctuated in organization throughout september 23 with its eye periodically clearing and becoming cloud-filled it maintained category3 hurricane strength during this phase despite a decreasing central pressure the storm finally weakened to category2 strength early on september 24 hurricane hunters observed flight-level winds of 116 to 135mph 187 to 217kmh however surface wind returns by the noaas stepped-frequency microwave radiometer were only 90mph 150kmh this indicated below-average mixing down of winds aloft by this time marias trajectory shifted almost due north between the aforementioned ridge and a cut-off low over the eastern gulf of mexicoweakening accelerated later on september 24 into september 25 as the hurricane traversed a cold wakewith sea surface temperatures of 7577f 2425ccreated by hurricane jose a week prior maria degraded to category1 strength during this time early on september 25 marias structure changed dramatically as its inner-core collapsed the low-level circulation became exposed to the northwest and most of the deep convection shifted to the eastern half of the storm maria further weakened into a tropical storm during the late afternoon of september 26 however a sustained convective burst resulted in marias winds increasing to hurricane-force once again on september 27 with banding features evident on the eastern part of the circulation despite this northwesterly wind shear continued to impinge on the storm and maria once again weakened to a tropical storm early on september 28 simultaneously maria began to accelerate to the east-northeast as it became embedded into the mid-latitude westerlies gradually weakening maria soon began to move over sea surface temperatures of 73f 23c and below causing most of its convection to dissipate late on september 30 maria transitioned into an extratropical cyclone during the next couple of days marias remnant accelerated towards the united kingdom while rapidly weakening marias remnants later crossed the iberian peninsula into the western mediterranean sea on october 3 before being absorbed by another frontal system later on the same dayupon the initiation of the national hurricane center nhcs first advisories for the system that would become tropical storm maria on the morning of september 16 the government of france issued tropical storm watches for the islands of martinique and guadeloupe while st lucia issued a tropical storm watch for its citizens and the government of barbados issued a similar watch for dominica barbados would later that day declare a tropical storm watch for its citizens and saint vincent and the grenadines the government of antigua and barbuda issued hurricane watches for the islands of antigua barbuda st kitts nevis and montserrat by the time of the nhcs second advisory which declared maria a tropical storm the dominican republic activated the international charter on space and major disasters for humanitarian satellite coverage on the 20thstill recovering from hurricane irma two weeks prior approximately 80,000remained without power as maria approached puerto rico electric power authority prepa struggled with increasing debt reaching 9billion even before the hurricanes prompting them to file for bankruptcy furthermore the company lost 30percent of its employees since 2012 aging infrastructure across the island makes the grid more susceptible to damage from storms the median age of prepa power plants is 44years inadequate safety also plagues the company and local newspapers frequently describe poor maintenance and outdated controlsthe islands water system was also troubled before the hurricanes seventy percent of the island had water that didnt meet the standards of the 1974 safe drinking water act according to the natural resources defense councilevacuation orders were issued in puerto rico in advance of maria and officials announced that 450 shelters would open in the afternoon of september 18 as of september 19 at least 2,000 people in puerto rico had sought shelteras maria approached the coast of north carolina and threatened to bring tropical storm conditions a storm surge warning was issued for the coast between ocracoke inlet and cape hatteras while a storm surge watch was issued for the pamlico sound the lower neuse river and the alligator river on the morning of september 26 a state of emergency was declared by officials in dare and hyde counties while visitors were ordered to evacuate hatteras and ocracoke islands ferry service between ocracoke and cedar island was suspended the evening of september 25 and remained suspended on september 26 and 27 due to rough seas while ferry service between ocracoke and hatteras island was suspended on september 26 and 27 the port in morehead city was closed by the united states coast guard on the morning of september 26 schools in dare county closed on september 26 and 27 while schools in carteret and tyrrell counties along with ocracoke island dismissed early on september 26 in anticipation of high winds schools in currituck county were closed on september 27 due to high windsthe outer rainbands of maria produced heavy rainfall and strong gusts across the southern windward islands the hewanorra and george f l charles airports of saint lucia respectively recorded 4.33in 110mm and 3.1in 80mm of rain though even higher quantities fell elsewhere on the island scattered rock slides landslides and uprooted trees caused minor damage and blocked some roads several districts experienced localized blackouts due to downed or damaged power lines the agricultural sector especially the banana industry suffered losses from the windsheavy rainfall amounting to 35in 75125mm caused scattered flooding across barbados in christ church the flood waters trapped residents from the neighborhood of goodland in their homes and inundated the business streets of saint lawrence gap maria stirred up rough seas that flooded coastal sidewalks in bridgetown and damaged boats as operators had difficulties securing their vessels high winds triggered an island-wide power outage and downed a coconut tree onto a residence in saint josephpassing 30mi 50km off the northern shorelines maria brought torrential rainfall and strong gusts to martinique but spared the island of its hurricane-force windfield which at the time extended 25mi 35km around the eye the commune of le marigot recorded 6.7inches 170mm of rain over a 24-hour period by september 19 maria had knocked out power to 70,000 households about 40% of the population water service was cut to 50,000 customers especially in the communes of le morne-rouge and gros-morne numerous roads and streets especially along the northern coast were impassible due to rock slides fallen trees and toppled power poles streets in fort-de-france were inundated in the seaside commune of le carbet rough seas washed ashore large rocks and demolished some coastal structures while some boats were blown over along the bay of the commune of schlcher martiniques agricultural sector suffered considerable losses about 70% of banana crops sustained wind damage with nearly every tree downed along the northern coast there were no deaths on the island although four people were injured in the hurricanetwo seriously and two lightlyrainfall ahead of the hurricane caused several landslides in dominica as water levels across the island began to rise by the afternoon of september 18 maria made landfall at 21:15 ast that day 1:15 utc september 19 as a category5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 160mph 260kmh these winds the most extreme to ever impact the island damaged the roof of practically every homeincluding the official residence of prime minister roosevelt skerrit who required rescue when his home began to flood downing all cellular radio and internet services maria effectively cut dominica off from the outside world the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricanes passage skerrit called the devastation mind boggling before going offline and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess damage initial ham radio reports from the capital of roseau on september 19 indicated total devastation with half the city flooded cars stranded and stretches of residential area flattenedthe next morning the first aerial footage of dominica elucidated the scope of the destruction maria left the mountainous country blanketed in a field of debris rows of houses along the entirety of the coastline were rendered uninhabitable as widespread floods and landslides littered neighborhoods with the structural remnants the hurricane also inflicted extensive damage to roads and public buildings such as schools stores and churches and affected all of dominicas 73,000 residents in some form or way the air control towers and terminal buildings of the canefield and douglas charles airports were severely damaged although the runways remained relatively intact and open to emergency landings the disaster affected all of the islands 53 health facilities including the badly damaged primary hospital compromising the safety of many patientsthe infrastructure of roseau was left in ruins practically every power pole and line was downed and the main road was reduced to fragments of flooded asphalt the winds stripped the public library of its roof panels and demolished all but one wall of the baptist church to the south of roseau riverside flooding and numerous landslides impacted the town of pointe michel destroying about 80% of its structures and causing most of the deaths in the country outside the capital area the worst of the destruction was concentrated around the east coast and rural areas where collapsed roads and bridges isolated many villages the port and fishing town of marigot saint andrew parish was 80% damaged settlements in saint david parish such as castle bruce good hope and grand fond had been practically eradicated many homes hung off cliffs or decoupled from their foundations in rosalie rushing waters gushed over the villages bridge and damaged facilities in its bay area throughout saint patrick parish the extreme winds ripped through roofs and scorched the vegetation buildings in grand bay the parishs main settlement experienced total roof failure or were otherwise structurally compromised many houses in la plaine caved in or slid into rivers and its single bridge was brokenoverall the hurricane damaged the roofs of as much as 98% of the islands buildings including those serving as shelters half of the houses had their frames destroyed its ferocious winds defoliated nearly all vegetation splintering or uprooting thousands of trees and decimating the islands lush rainforests the agricultural sector a vital source of income for the country was completely wiped out 100% of banana and tuber plantations was lost as well as vast amounts of livestock and farm equipment in marias wake dominicas population suffered from an island-wide water shortage due to uprooted pipes the caribbean disaster emergency management agency cdema estimates that the hurricane has caused billions of dollars worth of damage as of october 16 there are 57fatalities confirmed across the island with another 18people reported missingblustery conditions spread over guadeloupe as maria tracked to the south of the archipelago which endured hours of unabating hurricane-force winds the strongest winds blew along the southern coastlines of basse-terre island gourbeyre observed a peak wind speed of 101 mph 162kmh while winds up north in nearby baillif reached 92mph 148kmh along those regions the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20ft 6m waves the combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago especially from pointe--pitre along grand-terre islands southwestern coast to petit-bourg and the southern coasts on basse-terre island aside from wind-related effects rainfall from maria was also significant in just a day the hurricane dropped nearly a months worth of rainfall at some important locations pointe--pitre recorded a 24-hour total of 7.5inches 191mm while the capital of basse-terre measured 6.4in 163mm even greater quantities fell at higher elevations of basse terre island with a maximum total of 18.07in 459mm measured at the mountainous locality of matouba saint-claudethroughout the archipelago the hurricane left 40% of the population 80,000 households without power and 25% of landline users without service the islands of marie-galante la dsirade and especially les saintes bore the brunt of the winds which caused heavy damage to structures and nature alike and cut the islands off from their surroundings for several days homes on terre-de-haut island of les saintes were flooded or lost their roofs on the mainland sections of pointe--pitre stood under more than 3.3feet 1m of water and the citys hospital sustained significant damage the basse-terre region suffered severe damage to nearly 100% of its banana crops comrpising a total area of more than 5,000 acres 2,000 hectares farmers described the destruction to their plantations as complete annihilation beyond their impact on farmland the strong winds ravaged much of the islands vegetation fallen trees and branches covered practically every major road and were responsible for one death another person was killed upon being swept out to sea two people disappeared at sea after their vessel capsized offshore la dsirade east of mainland grande-terre damage from maria across guadeloupe amounted to at least 100 million us120 millionmarias outer eyewall was reported by the national hurricane center to have crossed saint croix while the hurricane was at category 5 intensity the hurricane caused extensive and severe damage to the island sustained winds at the sandy point national wildlife refuge reached 99 to 104mph 159 to 167kmh and gusted to 137mph 220kmh the hurricane killed two people both in their homes one person drowned and another was trapped by a mudslide a third person had a fatal heart attack during the hurricane the luis hospital suffered roof damage and flooding but remained operationalthe storm made landfall on puerto rico on wednesday september 20 a sustained wind of 64mph 103kmh with a gust to 113mph 182kmh was reported in san juan puerto rico immediately prior to the hurricane making landfall on the island after landfall wind gusts of 109mph 175kmh were reported at yabucoa harbor and 118mph 190kmh at camp santiago in addition very heavy rainfall occurred throughout the territory peaking at 37.9in 962.7mm in caguas widespread flooding affected san juan waist-deep in some areas and numerous structures lost their roof the coastal la perla neighborhood of san juan was largely destroyed catao saw extensive damage with the juana matos neighborhood estimated to be 80percent destroyed the primary airport in san juan the luis muoz marn international airport was slated to reopen on september 22storm surge and flash floodingstemming from flood gate releases at la plata lake damconverged on the town of toa baja trapping thousands of residents survivors indicate that flood waters rose at least 6ft 1.8m in 30minutes with flood waters reaching a depth of 15ft 4.6m in some areas more than 2,000people were rescued once military relief reached the town 24hours after the storm at least eight people died due to the flooding while many are unaccounted foras of october 14 the death toll stood at 48 with about 117 people missing on september 24 governor rossell estimated that the damage from hurricane maria in puerto rico was surely over the 8 billion damage by hurricane georges approximately 80percent of the territorys agriculture was lost due to the hurricane with agricultural losses estimated at 780millionthe hurricane completely destroyed the islands power grid leaving all 3.4million residents without electricity puerto rican governor ricardo rossell stated that it could take months to restore power in some locations with san juan mayor carmen yuln cruz estimating that some areas would remain without power for four to six months communication networks were crippled across the island ninety-five percent of cell networks were down with 48 of the islands 78 counties networks being completely inoperable eighty-five per cent of above-ground phone and internet cables were knocked out only one radio station wapa 680 am remained on-air through the stormthe nexrad doppler weather radar of puerto rico has also been literally blown away the radome which covers the radar antenna and which had to withstand winds of more than 130 mph was destroyed while the antenna of 30 feet in diameter was blown from the pedestal the latter remaining intact the radar is 2800 feet above sea level and the anemometer at the site measured winds of about 145 mph before communications broke which means winds at that height were likely 20 percent higher than what was seen at sea level its replacement will take a few monthsthe nearby island of vieques suffered similarly extensive damage communications were largely lost across the island widespread property destruction took place with many structures leveledthe recreational ship ferrel carrying a family of four issued a distress signal while battling 20ft 6.1m seas and 115mph 185kmh winds on september 20 communications with the vessel were lost near vieques on september 20 the united states coast guard united states navy and british royal navy conducted search-and-rescue operations utilizing an hc-130 aircraft a fast response cutter usskearsarge rfamounts bay and navy helicopters on september 21 the mother and her two children were rescued while the father drowned inside the capsized vesselmarias category 4 winds broke a 96-foot 29m line feed antenna of the arecibo observatory causing it to fall 500 feet

country assessments on september 22 indicate 110homes were destroyed 570 were damaged and 3,723 were affected by flooding approximately 60,000people lost power in northern areas of the country flooding and landslides rendered many roads impassable cutting off 38communities five people all of them males were killed in the dominican republic four of them were of haitian origin killed when they were swept away by floodwaters the fifth person was a dominican man who died in a landslidehurricane maria center passed 250 km from haiti northern coast but has received a large amount of rain and suffered some flooding three deaths were reported a 45-year-old man died in the commune of limbe in the department of the north while attempting to cross a flooded river two other people a woman and a man were mortally wounded in cornillon a small town 40 kilometers east of the capital port-au-prince according to the authoritiesmaria brushed the outer banks of north carolina on september 26 as the center of the storm passed by offshore and brought tropical storm conditions to the area along with a storm surge large waves and rip currents to the coast the storm knocked out power to 800 duke energy progress customers in the havelock area with restoration of power expected to take several hours dominion north carolina power and cape hatteras electric cooperative experienced scattered power outages winds of 23mph 37kmh and gusts of 41mph 66kmh were reported at dare county regional airport at manteo on september 27 while winds of 40mph 64kmh were reported in duck maria caused beach erosion at the ferry terminal at the north end of ocracoke island that washed out a portion of the paved lanes where vehicles wait to board the ferry by the morning of september 26 the storm flooded north carolina highway 12 along the coast rip currents from maria caused three swimmers to drown and several others to be rescued at the jersey shore on the weekend of september 2324 a fourth drowning death occurred in fernandina beach floridain the wake of the hurricane more than 85% of the islands houses were damaged of which more than 25% were completely destroyed leaving more than 50,000 of the islands 73,000 residents displaced following the destruction of thousands of homes most supermarkets and the water supply system many of dominicas residents were in dire need of food water and shelter for days with no access to electricity or running water and with sewage systems destroyed fears of widespread diarrhea and dysentery arose the islands agriculture a vital source of income for many was obliterated as most trees were flattened meanwhile the driving force of the economytourismwas expected to be scarce in the months that followed maria prime minister roosevelt skerrit characterized the devastation wrought by irma and maria as a sign of climate change and the threat it poses to the survival of his country stating to deny climate change  is to deny a truth we have just lived many islanders suffered respiratory problems as a result of excessive dust borne out of debris light rainfall in the weeks following maria alleviated this problem though it also slowed recovery efforts particularly rebuilding damaged rooftopsthrough the caribbean catastrophe risk insurance facility dominica received approximately us19.2million in emergency funds usswasp previously deployed to saint martin to assist in relief efforts after hurricane irma arrived in dominica on september 22 the vessel carried two sikorsky sh-60 seahawk helicopters to assist in distribution of relief supplies in hard-to-reach areas at the united nations general assembly on september 23 prime minister roosevelt skerrit called the situation in dominica an international humanitarian emergency the royal canadian navy vessel hmcsst johns was dispatched to dominica at the request of dominican prime minister skerritthe prime minister urged churches to encourage their membership to provide housing for senior citizens and disabled many of whom remained in damaged structures despite tarpaulin donations from venezuela palestine cuba jamaica and other countries as schools began to reopen on october16 the united nations childrens fund reported that the entire child population of dominica23,000 childrenremained vulnerable due to restricted access to clean drinking waterthe power grid was effectively destroyed by the hurricane leaving millions without electricity governor ricardo rossell estimated that maria caused at least us90 billion in damage as of september 26 95% of the island was without power less than half the population had tap water and 95% of the island had no cell phone service on october 6 a little more than two weeks after the hurricane 89% still had no power 44% had no water service and 58% had no cell service one month after the hurricane 88% of the island was without power about 3 million people 29% lacked tap water about 1 million people and 40% of the island had no cell service all hospitals were open but most were on backup generators that provide limited power about half of sewage treatment plants on the island were not still not functioning fema reported 60,000 homes needed roofing help and had distributed 38,000 roofing tarpsthe islands highways and bridges remained heavily damaged nearly a month later only 392 miles of puerto ricos 5,073 miles of road were open some towns continue to be isolated and delivery of relief supplies including food and water are hampered-- helicopters are the only alternative as of october 1 there were ongoing fuel shortage and distribution problems with 720 of 1,100 gas stations openthe guajataca dam was structurally damaged and on september 22 the national weather service issued a flash flood emergency for parts of the area in response tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate the area with about 70,000 thought to be at riskthe entirety of puerto rico was declared a federal disaster zone shortly after the hurricane the federal emergency management agency planned to open an air bridge with three to four aircraft carrying essential supplies to the island daily starting on september 22 beyond flights involving the relief effort limited commercial traffic resumed at luis muoz marn international airport on september 22 under primitive conditions a dozen commercial flights operated daily as of september 26 by october 3 there were 39 commercial flights per day from all puerto rican airports about a quarter of the normal number the next day airports were reported to be operating at normal capacity in marked contrast to the initial relief efforts for hurricane katrina and the 2010 haiti earthquake on september 22 the only signs of relief efforts were beleaguered puerto rican government employees the territorys government contracted 56small companies to assist in restoring power eight fema urban search  rescue usr teams were deployed to assist in rescue effortson september 24 the amphibious assault ship usskearsarge and the dock landing ship ussoak hill under rear admiral jeffrey w hughes along with the 2,400 marines of 26th marine expeditionary unit arrived to assist in relief efforts by september 24 there were 13 united states coast guard ships deployed around puerto rico assisting in the relief and restoration efforts the national security cutter uscgc james the

eleven cargo vessels collectively carrying 1.3million liters of water 23,000cots and dozens of generators arrived full operations at the ports of guayanilla salinas and tallaboa resumed on september 25 while the ports of san juan fajardo culebra guayama and vieques had limited operations the united states air force air mobility command has dedicated eight c-17 globemaster aircraft to deliver relief supplies the air force assisted the federal aviation administration with air traffic control repairs to increase throughput capacitythe united states transportation command has moved additional personnel and eight us army uh-60 black hawk helicopters from fort campbell kentucky to luis muoz marn international airport to increase distribution capacity the united states army corps of engineers deployed 670 personnel engaged in assessing and restoring the power grid as of september 25 83 generators were installed and an additional 186 generators were en route as of september 26 agencies of the us government have delivered 4 million meals 6 million liters of water 70,000 tarps and 15,000 rolls of roof sheeting national guard troops have been activated and deployed to puerto rico from connecticut georgia iowa illinois kentucky missouri new york rhode island and wisconsinon september 26 the hospital ship usnscomfort prepared to deploy and subsequently arrived a week later in puerto rico however most of the 250 bed floating state-of-the-art hospital has gone unused despite overburdened island clinics and hospitals puerto ricos department of health is supposed to refer patients there but there had been few referrals by october 17 governor rossell explained that the disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow and added i asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there after remaining offshore for several weeks the comfort docked in san juan briefly departing to restock food and medical supplies as of nov 8 staff had treated 1,476 patients including 147 surgeries and two birthson september 27 the pentagon reopened two major airfields on puerto rico and started sending aircraft specialized units and a hospital ship to assist in the relief effort brigadier general richard c kim the deputy commanding general of united states army north will be responsible for coordinating operations between the military fema and other government agencies and the private sector massive amounts of water food and fuel have either been delivered to ports in puerto rico or are held up at ports in the mainland united states because there is a lack of trucker drivers to move the goods into the interior the lack of communication networks has hindered the effort as only 20% of drivers have reported to work as of september 28 the port of san juan has only been able to dispatch 4% of deliveries received and has very little room to accept additional shipments as of september 28 44 percent of the population remains without drinking water and the us military is shifting from a short term sea-based response to a predominantly land-based effort designed to provide robust longer term support with fuel

with only two full-time employeeswas awarded a 300million contract by prepa to repair puerto ricos power grid the company contracted more than 300personnel and sent them to the island to carry out work prepa cited whitefishs comparatively small upfront cost of 3.7million for mobilization as one of the main reasons for contracting them over larger companies prepa executive director ricardo ramos stated whitefish was the only company -- it was the first that could be mobilized to puerto rico it did not ask us to be paid soon or a guarantee to pay no requests for assistance were made to the american public power association by october24 the decision to hire such a tiny company was considered highly unusual by many such as former energy department official susan tierney who stated the fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out it is at least odd why the utility would go to whitefish as the company was based in whitefish mont the hometown of us interior secretary ryan zinke this also led to accusations of privatization though zinke dismissed these claims and stated that he had no role in securing the contract several representatives both democrats and republicans also voiced their concern over the choice to contract whitefish instead of other companiesin a press release on october27 fema stated it

waive the jones act for puerto rico which prevented the commonwealth from receiving any aid and supplies from non-us-flagged vessels from us ports the waiver was granted after two days while in contrast the waiver was not granted for hurricane harvey until fourteen days after the hurricane and was narrowly drafted to only allow fuel transportation for seven days a dhs security spokesman said

the administration was not responding effectively general joseph l lengyel chief of the national guard bureau defended the trump administrations response and reiterated that relief efforts were hampered by puerto rico being an island rather than on the mainland president donald trump responded to accusations that he does not care about puerto rico puerto rico is very important to me and puerto rico -- the people are fantastic people i grew up in new york so i know many people from puerto rico i know many puerto ricans and these are great people and we have to help them the island is

assess a targeted and effective response and support its local partners on-the-ground effortson october 2 2017 oxfam released a rare statement while the us government is engaged in relief efforts it has failed to address the most urgent needs oxfam has monitored the response in puerto rico closely and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the us government has mounted said oxfam americas president abby maxman oxfam rarely responds to humanitarian emergencies in the us and other wealthy countries but as the situation in puerto rico worsens and the federal governments response continues to falter we have decided to step in the us has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner in an update on october19 the agency called the situation in puerto rico unacceptable and called for a more robust and efficient response from the us governmenton october 3 2017 president trump visited puerto rico he compared the damage from hurricane maria to that of hurricane katrina saying if you looked  every death is a horror but if you look at a real catastrophe like katrina and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overbearing nobody has seen anything like this  what is your death count as of this morning 17? trumps remarks were widely criticized for implying that hurricane maria was not a real catastrophe while in puerto rico trump also distributed canned goods and paper towels to crowds gathered at a relief shelter and told the residents of the devastated island i hate to tell you puerto rico but youve thrown our budget a little out of whack because weve spent a lot of money on puerto rico and thats fine we saved a lot of liveson october 12 trump tweeted we cannot keep fema the military  the first responders who have been amazing under the most difficult circumstances in pr forever prompting further criticism from lawmakers in both parties mayor cruz replied you are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done in response to a request for

is done
