brazil current  wikipedia the brazil current is a warm water current that flows south along the brazilian south coast to the mouth of the ro de la platathis current is caused by diversion of a portion of the atlantic south equatorial current from where that current meets the south american continent the brazil current begins at about 10-15s where the south equatorial current sec splits near cabo de sao roque brazil the current reaches a depth of 700m and the estimated transport at 12s is 2.5 svthe transport increases as the current goes further south with 4 sv at 15s on the offshore side of the current an anticyclonic recirculation gyre at about 30s causes an increase of the brazil currents transport the estimated southward transport at 27s 31s 34s and 36s are 11 sv 17 sv 22 sv and 41 sv the total transport can be from 70-80 sv by 36s with half of it being in the recirculation gyre the brazil current is a part of the south atlantic subtropical gyre the southern side of the gyre consists of the eastward flowing south atlantic current sac the eastern boundary is the benguela current system bcs the north side consists of the sec which flows west and then splits with the north water becoming the north brazil current nbc the southern flowing waters become the brazil current which makes up the western boundary it is a western boundary current like the gulf stream and is indeed its southern counterpart however it is considerably shallower and weaker it flows south from the equator to the west wind drift it joins the falkland current malvinas current at the argentine sea see brazilfalkland confluence making it a temperate sea the brazil-falkland confluence is where the brazil current begins to separate from the coast at about 36s and is when the saltier subtropical water of the brazil current meets the fresher subantarctic water of the falkland current the main transport of the current leaves the continental shelf at about 38s and the sea surface temperature at this latitude is estimated to be about 16-18c although the latitude where the current separates from the coast has been thought to be farther north from july to september than from january to march if the falkland current has low transport then the path of the brazil current is dominated by wind stress curl however if the falkland current transport is increased then the brazil current separates from the coast at the observed 38s latitude the range of sea surface temperature and the salinity for the brazil-falkland confluence is 7-18c and 33.6-36 psu the brazil current region also contains six major water masses within the system upper circumpolar water ucpw lower circumpolar water lcpw central water cw antarctic intermediate water aaiw antarctic bottom water aabw and north atlantic deep water nadw
