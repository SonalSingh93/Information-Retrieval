australian broadcasting corporation  wikipedia the australian broadcasting corporation abc is australias national broadcaster funded by australian taxpayers but specifically independent of government and politics in the commonwealth the abc plays a leading role in journalistic independence and is fundamental in the history of broadcasting in australia its model based on  but not restricted to  the bbc in the united kingdom originally financed in a similar method to the british model using consumer licence fees on broadcasting receivers its funding evolved to a projected model approved by the australian parliament in recent times the corporation provides television radio online and mobile services throughout metropolitan and regional australia as well as overseas through australia plus and radio australiafounded in 1929 as the australian broadcasting company the abc was a government licensed consortium of private entertainment and content providers authorised under supervision to broadcast on the airwaves using a two-tiered system the a system derived its funds primarily from the licence fees levied on the purchasers of the radio receivers with an emphasis on building the radio wave infrastructure into regional and remote areas whilst the b system relied on privateers and their capacity to establish viable enterprises using the new technology following the general downward economic trends of the era as entrepreneurial ventures in national infrastructure struggled with viability the company was subsequently acquired to become a fully state-owned corporation on 1 july 1932 and renamed as australian broadcasting commission re-aligning more closely to the british bbc modelthe australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 changed the name of the organisation to the australian broadcasting corporation effective 1 july 1983 although funded and owned by the government the abc remains editorially independent as ensured through the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983the abc is sometimes informally referred to as aunty originally in imitation of the british broadcasting corporations nicknamethe first public radio station in australia opened in sydney on 23 november 1923 under the call sign 2sb with other stations in melbourne brisbane adelaide perth and hobart following a licensing scheme administered by the postmaster-generals department was soon established allowing certain stations government funding albeit with restrictions placed on their advertising contentfollowing a 1927 royal commission inquiry into radio licensing issues the government established the national broadcasting service which subsequently took over a number of the larger funded stations it also nationalised the australian broadcasting company which had been created by entertainment interests to supply programs to various radio stations on 1 july 1932 the australian broadcasting commission was established taking over the operations of the national broadcasting service and eventually establishing offices in each of australias capital citiesover the next four years the stations were reformed into a cohesive broadcasting organisation through regular program relays coordinated by a centralised bureaucracy the australian broadcast radio spectrum was constituted of the abc and the commercial sectornews broadcasts were initially restricted due to pressure from sir keith murdoch who controlled many australian newspapers however journalists such as frank dixon and john hinde began to subvert the agreements in the late 1930s in 1939 warren denning was appointed to canberra as the first abc political correspondent after murdoch had refused to allow his newspapers to cover a speech by joseph lyonsin 1942 the australian broadcasting act was passed giving the abc the power to decide when and in what circumstances political speeches should be broadcast directions from the minister about whether or not to broadcast any matter now had to be made in writing and any exercise of the power had to be mentioned in the commissions annual report it was used only once in 1963 in the same year kindergarten of the air began on abc radio in perth

in 200809 in the 200910 federal budget the abc received funding of 929.9 millionuntil 1948 the abc was funded directly by radio licence fees amendments were also made to the australian broadcasting act that meant the abc would receive its funding directly from the federal government licence fees remained until 1973 when they were abolished by the whitlam labor government on the basis that the near-universality of television and radio services meant that public funding was a fairer method of providing revenue for government-owned radio and television broadcastersthe term where your 8 cents a day goes coined in the late 1980s during funding negotiations is often used in reference to the services provided by the abc it is estimated that the cost of the abc per head of population per day was 7.1 cents a day based on the corporations 200708 base funding of 543million budget figures above show the abc costs over 14 cents per day todaythe australian communications minister senator stephen conroy indicated strong support from the government for the abcs funding submission for the 2009/10 budget saying the organisation had been underfunded for many yearsunder the australian broadcasting corporation act 1983 the abc board is bound to maintain the independence and integrity of the corporation and to ensure that the gathering and presentation by the corporation of news and information is accurate and impartial according to the recognized standards of objective journalismin relation to impartiality and diversity of perspectives the current abc editorial policy requires of the broadcaster that the abc gather and present news and information with impartiality and presents a diversity of perspectives so that over time no significant strand of thought or belief within the community is knowingly excluded or disproportionately represented the broadcaster is expected to take no editorial stance other than a commitment to fundamental democratic principlesas a publicly funded broadcaster the abc is expected not to take editorial stances on political issues and is required to present a range of views with impartiality over the decades accusations of bias at the abc have arisen at different times and various inquiries undertakenreviews of the abc are regularly commissioned and sometimes not released a 2004 roy morgan media credibility survey found that media professionals regarded abc radio as the most accurate news source in the country in mid 2013 the university of the sunshine coast released a study of the professional views of journalists slightly over half of respondents expected to vote for either labor or the greens whereas just under a third planned to vote coalition in contrast over 40% of abc journalists would vote for the greens and almost a third labordr rhonda jollys 2014 abc overview noted that many commentators have argued consistently that there is a left wing bias which dominates abc news and programming and cited a 2005 piece by paul gray that the broadcaster was overly influenced by the narrow middle-class values of the australian secular left and said that while the national broadcaster had at times offended governments of all persuasions it had always adopted a from the left perspective jolly also noted however that supporters of the abc deny claims that the broadcaster is either intentionally or inadvertently biased and that speaking from opposition politicians have praised the abc for its scrutiny of government the paper noted that in december 2013 abc chairman james spigelman called four independent audits a year in response to the frequent allegations of lack of impartiality in news and current affairs in response to one set of criticisms journalist annabel crabb who has worked at the abc commented every single day i see that organisation give voices to australians who otherwise wouldnt be heard on topics that are too uncommercial or too remote or too hard to be covered by anyone else broadcasting into areas from which others have long withdrawn resourcesthe conservative liberal party governments in the 1960s and 1970s attempted to influence the abcs political coverage by threatening to reduce funding for its news and current affairs divisionbob hawke criticised some of the 7.30 reports coverage of the 1991 gulf war to which he committed naval forces as being loaded biased and disgracefulfor much of the howard government years abc tvs masthead political programs were anchored by labor affiliated journalists kerry obrien barrie cassidy and maxine mckew 7.30 report and insiders were hosted by former labor staffers kerry obrien and barrie cassidy respectively while the 2007 election saw lateline host mckew defeat liberal prime minister john howard as the labor

north sydneyof the 1996 prime ministerial election debates between opposition leader john howard and labor prime minister paul keating howard later wrote i flatly refused to have kerry obrien of the abc moderate the debates because of the way he had handled the second keating-hewson debate in 1993" in which obrien went in to bat for keating howard went on to win that election a decade later the abc media watch program reported that nsw liberal senator concetta fierravanti-wells had written to her constituents to say that the abc had a collective loathing of john howard at the end of the howard governments term in 2007 left-wing political commentator robert manne wrote in the monthly that the howard government had viewed the broadcaster as being run by left-wing ideologues who had supposedly pushed the agenda of the left on issues like refugees the republic multiculturalism reconciliation radical feminism extreme environmentalism anti-americanism gay rights and so onsoon after coming to office in 1996 the howard government reduced the abcs operating grants by 10% its appointment of jonathan shier to the position of managing director was controversial for his program of budget cuts restructuring and the loss of several high-profile personalities and shows shier left the position early on 31 october 2001 7.30 report anchor kerry obrien opposed howards budget cuts to the abc and describes the appointment of shier as its managing director as a manifestation of the conservative obsession with the abc as a kind of biased left-wing culturein howards last election he was defeated in the seat of bennelong by labor candidate maxine mckew who had hosted lateline during the howard era peter mares reported for radio national that some wags described it as an internal promotion while others said shed simply moved from the media wing to the political wing of the alp mares consulted abc journalist turned nsw liberal mla pru goward who said  i have no doubt there was left-wing bias i certainly thought it when i was there while mckew said there was no left wing bias though what i detected years ago in the abc much more of a collectivist philosophyabc tvs masthead political programs continued to have strong labor party connections through the period in october 2010 the abc announced that former labor staffer kerry obrien would host four corners beginning in 2011 former labor staffer barrie cassidy continued to host the insiders program in december 2010 chris uhlmann husband of labor mp gai brodtmann was appointed as co-host of the 7.30 current affairs program in 2012 sydney abc news anchor juanita phillips began a relationship with labors minister for climate change greg combetconservative commentators such as andrew bolt tim blair and gerard henderson accused the abc of a left-wing biasliberal prime minister tony abbott perceived the abc to be left wing and hostile to his government while his successor malcolm turnbull enjoyed better relations with the national broadcaster when the abc co-operated with the guardian to publish stolen documents purporting to reveal monitoring of indonesian officials by australian spy agencies under the rudd government abbott told 2gb radio a lot of people feel at the moment that the abc instinctively takes everyones side but australias abbott reportedly called the qa program a lefty lynch mob when it invited a man convicted of threatening commonwealth officials to participate in questioning one of his ministers amid a heightened terrorism alert in june 2015 abbott asked the makers of the program whose side are you on the abc found that there had been an error of judgement but repeated the program later in the week prompting abbott to say that heads should roll over the affair abbott initiated a brief ministerial boycott of the qa program following the affairthe broadcaster was critical of abbott when he broke an election-eve promise not to make cuts to the abc and required 4.6% cuts over five years as part of his budget repair program in early 2015 an internal abc review of its coverage of joe hockeys first budget criticised the post-budget interviews by 7:30 and lateline finding that the interviewers had given the impression of biaswhen abbott lost the leadership to turnbull in the september 2015 liberal leadership spill the hosts of the abcs political programs spoke in favour of abbotts demise kerry obrien and barrie cassidy hosts respectively of the abcs flagship weekly current affairs programs four corners and insiders welcomed the replacement of abbott by turnbull as did abc radio commentators fran kelly paul bongiorno and amanda vanstone fairfax and news limited reported that leigh sales the host of 7.30 gave turnbull an unusually warm first interview following his toppling of abbottin a march 2016 interview with abc managing director mark scott media watch host paul barry examined the question of perceptions of left wing bias at the abc scott noted that while perhaps the abc was more concerned about gay marriage than about electricity prices he did not accept the criticism of bias because a lot of that criticism comes from right wing commentators and they wonder where are the strong right wing commentators on the abc we dont do that kind of journalism we dont ask questions about our journalists voting pattern and where their ideology are we look at the journalism that they put to air and we have strong editorial standards following the interview conservative abc critic andrew bolt wrote how can the man heading our biggest media organisation be so blind to the abcs unlawful and dangerous leftist bias while former media watch host jonathan holmes wrote for the age that this interview indicated that abc management had failed to recognise a clear problem of left wing bias among some capital city radio presentersover the period abc tv and radio hosts advocated strongly in support of same-sex marriage upon which the wider australian community and political parties were divided when the turnbull government announced plans for a postal plebiscite on the issue advocacy for change continued prompting a call for restraint from the abcs editorial policy manager mark maleyan interview by abc presenter joe obrien with lyle shelton was the subject of a complaint by the australian christian lobby bringing up ian thorpes swimming achievements obrien asked shelton what right do you have to participate in that joy and take national pride in those achievements if you now deny him the right to feel like an equal and experience the joy of marriage in rejecting any perceived bias the abc said it was a devils advocate question and not inconsistent with standardsa number of former journalists and presenters have
