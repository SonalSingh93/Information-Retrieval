hurricane janet  wikipedia hurricane janet was the most powerful tropical cyclone of the 1955 atlantic hurricane season and one of the strongest atlantic hurricanes on record the eleventh tropical storm ninth hurricane and fifth major hurricane of the year janet formed from a tropical wave east of the lesser antilles on september21 moving westward across the caribbean sea janet fluctuated in intensity but generally strengthened before reaching its peak intensity as a category5 hurricane with winds of 175mph 280kmh the intense hurricane later made landfall at that intensity near chetumal mexico on september28 after weakening over the yucatn peninsula it moved into the bay of campeche where it slightly strengthened before making its final landfall near veracruz on september29 janet quickly weakened over mexicos mountainous terrain before dissipating on september30in its developmental stages janet caused 7.8million in damage to the lesser antilles and 189deaths in the grenadines and barbados while janet was in the central caribbean sea a reconnaissance aircraft flew into the storm and was lost with all eleven crew members believed to be perished this remains the only such loss which has occurred in association with an atlantic hurricane a category5 upon landfall on the yucatn peninsula janet caused severe devastation in areas of quintana roo and british honduras only five buildings in chetumal mexico remained intact after the storm and an estimated 500deaths occurred in the mexican state of quintana roo at janets second landfall near veracruz significant river flooding ensued worsening effects caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the month the floods left thousands of people stranded and killed at least 326people in the tampico area leading to the largest mexican relief operation ever executed by the united statesjanets landfall as a category5 hurricane on the yucatn peninsula was the first recorded instance that a storm of such intensity in the atlantic made landfall on a continental mainland prior to janet landfalls of category5 intensity were only known to have taken place on islands janets minimum barometric pressure recorded in chetumal was at the time the second lowest recorded pressure on land associated with a tropical cyclone in the atlantic behind the 1935 labor day hurricane at least 1,023deaths were attributed to hurricane janet as well as 65.8million in damages the name janet was later retired from the atlantic list of tropical cyclone names due to its significance to the scientific research communitya weak tropical disturbance was first reported by the air france and iberia airlines east of the lesser antilles early on september21 although it was speculated that the disturbance originated from a tropical wave near cape verde the weather bureau considered the system too weak to be detected due to a lack of reports from the islands at 1800utc on september21 while it was located 350mi 565km east-southeast of martinique the disturbance became sufficiently organized for the weather bureau to classify it as tropical storm janet the tenth named storm of the season upon classification janet quickly intensified as it moved to the west on september22 janet attained hurricane strength and proceeded to intensify rapidly as it moved westward across the windward islands by 1200utc that day janet already attained category3 hurricane strength with maximum sustained winds of 120mph 195kmh before stalling in intensificationshortly after 1700utc on september22 the eye of janet passed over barbados a reconnaissance flight into the hurricane discovered that the hurricane janets eye measured only 20mi 32km in diameter with gale force winds extending 120mi 190km away from the center of circulation the flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979mbar hpa 28.91inhg after passing between the islands of grenada and carriacou in the morning hours of september23 janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern caribbean sea as a result the hurricane became disorganized with winds weakening to 90mph 145kmh by 1200utc on september23 a us navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on september24 reporting a lack of organization and noting an indiscernible center of circulation with weak rainbands however the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions regaining major hurricane strength by 1200utc on september24 and subsequently category 4hurricane intensity by the next daywhile trekking across the central caribbean sea janet was only slightly larger than while it was moving over the windward islands with gale force winds extending 125mi 200km out from the center by september25 remaining a category4 hurricane as it moved erratically westward across the caribbean a reconnaissance flight mission during the night of september2526 indicated strong rainbands with frequent lightning strikes and a well-defined eye evidence that the storm was once again rapidly intensifying as it neared the yucatn peninsula on september26 janet began accelerating in forward speed after the reconnaissance flight snowcloud five was lost while making a penetration into the hurricanes eye another flight early on september27 reported a minimum pressure of 938mbar hpa 27.70inhg with winds in excess of 115mph 185kmh by a large and incalculable amount the hurricane was estimated to have intensified to category5 hurricane intensitythe highest rating on the modern day saffirsimpson hurricane scaleat 1200utc on september27 while in the western caribbean sea janet continued to intensify afterwards eventually reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 175mph 280kmh with gale force winds having expanded to at least 250mi 400km away from the center of the hurricane janet maintained peak intensity as it passed over the swan islands before making landfall in extreme southern quintana roo mexico just east of chetumal mexico in that city a barometer indicated a minimum barometric pressure of 914mbar hpa 27.00inhg in the eye of janet at the time this was the second lowest pressure ever recorded on land in a landfalling atlantic hurricane behind the 1935 labor day hurricane though janet was later surpassed by hurricanes dean and gilbert which also made landfall on the yucatn peninsula as category5 hurricanesonce over land janet considerably weakened to a category2 hurricane with winds of 105mph 170kmh after crossing the yucatn peninsula with a forward speed of 21mph 34kmh the hurricane emerged into the bay of campeche by 1600utc on september28 the weakened hurricane marginally intensified as it crossed the bay of campeche to a secondary peak intensity of 110mph 175kmh with a minimum central pressure of 950mbar hpa 28.06inhg janet eventually made its final landfall 50mi 80km north of the city of veracruz by 2200utc on september29 as a category2 hurricane after moving inland the hurricane became quickly disorganized due to the highly mountainous terrain of mexico and as a result the weather bureau issued its last advisory on janet the weakening system degenerated to tropical storm strength by september30 and later dissipated over central mexico by 0600utc that day janets remnant circulation contributed to the development of a disturbed area of weather off the western coast of mexico that would subsequently develop into a tropical storm on october1upon janets formation east of the windward islands the weather bureau office in san juan puerto rico advised small craft to remain in port and vessels in the path of the developing storm to exercise caution after a reconnaissance flight reported much stronger winds than initially suggested hurricane warnings were issued at 1600utc on september22 for the entirety of the lesser antilles from saint lucia to grenada including barbados storm warnings were issued for all islands in the windward islands from saint lucia south to tobago excluding st vincent and the grenadines all warnings in the windward antilles remained in effect until 1000utc on september22 shortly after warnings were lowered in the windward islands storm warnings were issued for the abc islands and the paraguan peninsula of venezuela at 0200utc on september23 after janet passed north of the islands all storm warnings were lifted on the morning of september25 the weather bureau later warned interests in jamaica but did not issue any hurricane-related warnings for the islandthe weather bureau first began cautioning areas of central america at 1600utc on september26 advising people in areas of northeast nicaragua and honduras to take precautionary measures along with all vessels and small craft in the gulf of honduras south to cabo gracias a dios after janet began accelerating towards the west-northwest advisories warned areas in british honduras and quintana roo of hurricane-related impacts though no official warnings were issued for areas of central america advisories published by the weather bureau cautioned interests in the hurricanes path up until landfall evacuations took place in several coastal towns in quintana roo upon notification of the oncoming storm people were evacuated to inland hillside shelters after the hurricane moved through the yucatn peninsula and entered the bay of campeche the weather bureau alerted areas in the storms path on the western side of mexicos gulf coast at the time janet was expected to make landfall between veracruz and tuxpan areas were warned of the storms potential flooding and coastal impacts the weather bureau advised all small craft south of port oconnor texas to remain in port notifications of janet to potentially affected areas were stopped after the hurricane made landfallduring its existence areas of the lesser antilles abc islands and central america were affected by janet at least 65.8million in damages and 1,023deaths were caused by the hurricane mostly in quintana roo the large number of deaths and damage caused by janet helped make the 1955atlantic hurricane season the deadliest and costliest hurricane season documented since comprehensive record of such statistics began in 1942as a small but rapidly intensifying hurricane janet passed just south of barbados on september22 becoming the first hurricane to strike the island in 57years since the 1898 windward islands hurricane maximum sustained winds on the south side of the island were estimated to be between 110120mph 180190kmh the strong winds knocked out communication lines preventing officials from accurately enumerating casualties on the island though communications were still maintained by commercial cable companies and amateur radio electric power was later restored allowing newspapers to publish information on the storm sugar cane the island countrys main source of revenue was severely damaged with losses estimated to be in excess of 1million poorly constructed dwellings were blown apart by the strong winds an estimated 8,100homes were damaged by the hurricane the destroyed buildings and trees blocked highways and the seawell airport was forced to close heavy rains peaked at 4in 100mm and a storm surge of 7ft 2.1m swept away low-lying houses along the coast an estimated 2,000people were left homeless due to the hurricane property damage on barbados was estimated to be 5million and at least 57people were killedon september23 janet passed directly between grenada and carriacou in the grenadines killing 122people in the island chain an airport on grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds eight people were killed in a small town adjacent to the airport strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses and unroofed a hotel in st georges grenada houses were also unroofed and balconies of government offices in st georges were torn off all bridges in the islands interior regions collapsed and spice crops sustained heavy damage an estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed along with nearly all of the islands banana and cocoa crops three ships were also grounded in the local harbor in the carenage the waterfront region of st georges debris was scattered and an 820ft 250m pier collapsed st vincent was mostly destroyed and st lucia suffered significant coastal damage over 2.8million in damages were estimated throughout the grenadines farther south in port of spain a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed killing ten peoplehurricane janet skirted the abc islands with strong winds as it passed to the north from september2425 in aruba gusts peaked at 50mph 80kmh uprooting trees however damage outside of trees was primarily insignificant in bonaire piers were destroyed and the islands coastal boulevard was damaged beach facilities at curaaos piscadera and vaersen bays suffered considerable damage quays along the harbor entrance were also damagedon september26 the hurricane hunter p2v-3w neptune aircraft snowcloud five led by us navy lieutenant commander grover b windham was sent from guantnamo bay to investigate janet which was at the time a category4 hurricane south of jamaica upon penetration of the hurricanes eyewall at an altitude of 700ft 200m a final transmission was received from the reconnaissance flight before it presumably crashed in the caribbean sea all 11people on board including nine crew members and two journalists were killed following the loss of the plane an extensive search and rescue operation took place over a large area of the caribbean sea with 3,000personnel involved with the search returning no results the exact cause of the crash remains unknown though it is speculated that the planes altimeter gave an incorrect reading due to the low surrounding barometric pressure although four hurricane reconnaissance flights have been lost since operations began in 1943 snowcloud five remains the only known loss of a reconnaissance aircraft as a result of a hurricane in the atlantic basin with the other three occurring as a result of pacific typhoonsas it approached the yucatn peninsula janet passed over the swan islands north of honduras as a category5 hurricane on september27 the hurricane caused rough seas and strong winds uprooted trees and antennas after gusts exceeded an estimated 100mph 160kmh officials on the islands took shelter in a navy seismograph building though no deaths were reported janet destroyed almost all buildings on the islands the us weather bureau and civil aeronautics authority requested food and supplies for 82people on the island after the storm passedafter passing the swan islands janet made landfall on the yucatn peninsula between corozal town british honduras and chetumal mexico at 1700utc on september28 at the time it had winds of 175mph 280kmh hurricane force winds were reported for two hours preceding the hurricanes landfall with numerous pressure readings below 948mbar hpa 28.00inhg roads and crops on the peninsula sustained heavy damage due to janet in xcalak quintana roo the strong winds from janet flattened the ports infrastructure and only one house remained intact after the storms passage 97people were killed in xcalak constituting more than a third of the ports population chetumal mexico was devastated with only four buildings left standing storm surge pushed water to a depth of 6.5feet 2m 1600ft 490m inland despite the peninsula protecting the city from the open ocean the death toll in chetumal remains uncertain 120bodies were recovered in the city but it is unknown how many were ever found an additional 10,000people in the city were left homeless after the hurricane and were forced to sleep in the open overnight federal relief agencies previously providing service for areas affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year in western areas of the gulf coast of mexico were ordered to extend relief operations to the yucatn peninsula in quintana roo hurricane janet was estimated to have caused 40million in damages and at least 500deaths the most of any region affected by janetmaking landfall near the border between mexico and british honduras the latter colonys corozal and orange walk districts containing a population of 15,500at the time experienced severe devastation from janet strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across british honduras particularly in the freshwater creek forest preserve there an estimated 30%of all trees had been damaged especially mahogany and sapodilla trees hurricane janet also caused extensive damage to crops with an estimated 2.631million in damages fruit trees maize and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage sugar cane was expected to have a 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses to a lesser extent the hurricane also affected the belize district and several of british honduras offshore cayes similar to corozal and orange walk districts corn trees and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any cropin corozal town british honduras south of where janet made landfall 500people were made homeless and six people were killed about 90%of all buildings in the town were destroyed and communications were knocked out by the strong winds based on an average home cost of 2,000 it was estimated that property damage to homes in corozal town totaled 800,000 much of santa elena british honduras was also flattened by the strong winds farther south in belize city winds peaked at 60mph 100kmh though no damage was reported in british honduras the hurricanes effects were less deadly than in quintana roo but in northern portions of the colony the storm killed 16people and caused 5million in damageswhile in the bay of campeche the shrimp boat celestino arias was sunken by strong waves generated by janet after it suffered engine failures the stranded ship was heavily damaged by the hurricanes strong winds in the bay which broke towing lines all of the ships crewmen which had evacuated the boat after it sunk were later rescued and brought back to tampa florida along the coast tides were reported to be 34ft 0.911.2m above average farther north along the texas coast tides were 2ft 0.61m above average blocking beach roads near corpus christijanet made its final landfall in the mexican state of veracruz between the cities of nautla and veracruz as a category2 hurricane at 2200utc on september29 in nautla communications were cut by strong winds from the hurricane the strong winds also caused a relief plane to crash causing five deaths heavy rains in the tampico tamaulipas area added to floods caused by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year the resulting flood was reported by the weather bureau office in new orleans to be one of the worst natural disasters in mexican history in tampico 16in 410mm of rain was reported the floods contributed to a localized typhoid fever and dysentery outbreak causing over 1,000people to evacuate out of the city to prevent further spreading of the diseases an additional 36,000people were being cared for in concentration centers although located south of where janet made landfall areas of veracruz were inundated by strong storm surge including the citys main streets and port operations along a railroad stretching from laredo texas to mexico city were stopped after having just reopened due to hurricane hildafarther inland as janet dissipated over the mountainous central mexico the storm dropped torrential rainfall over the tamisi and panuco river basins the water levels in the panuco river remained above flood stage for four weeks in tampico the river flooded neighborhoods forcing cables to be stretched along roads to prevent people from being swept away small boats were also sent to monitor streets according to some sources 800people died from the floods with thousands more being stranded in the city tamazunchale was inundated by an overflowing moctezuma river the rains caused a landslide in colonia san rafael killing 12people heavy rains also impacted guadalajara which had previously not been affected by any tropical cyclones earlier in the year in maltarana jalisco the lerma and duero rivers overflowed forcing 800people in the town to evacuate farther north in sonora cotton crops damaged by janet were estimated to amount to 12million in damages combined property damage in mexico from hurricanes gladys hilda and janet was estimated to total 200million nearly half of the governments 1955national budget although there were no official damage or fatality estimates at least 1,000people were injured and another 100,000people were made homeless on the mexican mainland due to janetafter janet passed barbados the island was declared a state of emergency relief workers on barbados helped to clean up debris scattered by the strong winds on highways and the local government made requests for food and construction materials the extensive damaged caused by janet on the island to low-income households led the passage of the 1955housing act which created the national housing authority nha in 1956 the nha was responsible for the acquisition of lands on which houses could be built with stronger and more permanent materials which was thought to minimize maintenance costs and hurricane-related damage the newly founded organization quickly worked to rebuild homes after the hurricane struckin grenada the islands governor issued an emergency order against the hoarding of food in the aftermath of janet due to the food and water shortage that resulted from janet a united states destroyer and a british frigate were sent to bring relief supplies to grenada and ships departing from jamaica and trinidad were redirected to the island to help send supplies the british government later announced that it would send 50,000 us155,000 in relief to the grenadines the crown agents and red cross delivered relief supplies to barbados and the grenadines which included aluminum roofing sheets and portable electric generatorsrelief and reconstruction measures were enacted in the british honduras beginning on september30 a large-scale reconstruction program was initiated by the government to help rebuild 48villages the government also declared a state of emergency for corozal orange walk and belize administrative districts including a ban on liquor sales temporary communication lines were rebuilt which initially only allowed official communications with affected areas due to the severity of the damage in corozal an airstrip was built to help deliver relief to the city more efficiently food depots in corozal louisville and orange walk town were tasked with distributing food the potential for widespread disease following the devastation wrought by janet forced a widespread vaccination initiative against typhoid fever in affected areas the jamaican government sent 20,000 us55,000 to the colony in relief funds while the british government sent 40,000 us110,000 to affected areas in the british honduras and other affected islands in the caribbean the united states sent the cargo ship uss antares which supplied the colony with various relief materials in corozal town a 3.5million grant was given to land surveyor hc fairweather to plan and reconstruct the townshipa us navy relief plane was sent to chetumal mexico to deliver food and other relief supplies after janet struck the region in areas previously affected by hurricanes gladys and hilda earlier in the year federal relief agencies were ordered to extend relief operations to the yucatn peninsula however after crossing the bay of campeche and making landfall near veracruz relief measures were once again implemented in the western gulf coast of mexico the mexican air force commercial and private planes and helicopters were sent to bring relief supplies and airlift refugees the united states initiated the largest relief campaign ever staged in mexico at the time various government and relief agencies including the american red cross and the salvation army participated in the relief efforts the united states air force and united states army began a joint-relief operation to send relief supplies to the tampico area beginning with the deployment of a curtiss c-46 commando from the harlingen air force base on october1 ten other military transport aircraft from the united states air force were sent from texas to provide food and clothing pan american world airways sent a boeing 314 from miami florida to evacuate victims helicopters were sent from the uss saipan to transfer food and medical supplies from the light aircraft carrier other ships also aided in delivering supplies including the uss siboney which also deployed helicopters to assist in relief efforts by october6 1,500people were estimated to have been rescued from the tampico area and at least 280,000lb 130,000kg of food and clothing materials were estimated to have been delivered by the us air force to the city there typhoid serum shots were administered as a precautionary measure former president manuel vila camacho died of a heart ailment in part due to over-exertion in helping in the relief effortsdue to its large swath of destruction the name janet was retired by the weather bureau becoming just the seventh atlantic tropical cyclone to have its name retired and the fourth to be retired in 1955
