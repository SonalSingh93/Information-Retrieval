settlers on the caicos islands they developed cotton as an important cash crop but it was superseded by the development of the salt industryin 1799 both the turks and the caicos island groups were annexed by britain as part of the bahamas the processing of sea salt was developed as a highly important export product from the west indies with the labour done by african slaves salt continued to be a major export product into the nineteenth centuryin 1807 britain prohibited the slave trade and in 1833 abolished slavery in its colonies british ships sometimes intercepted slave traders in the caribbean and some ships were wrecked off the coast of these islands in 1837 the esperanza a portuguese slaver was wrecked off east caicos one of the larger islands while the crew and 220 captive

opposition by the former turks and caicos government with misicks successor williams calling it a coup and stating that our country is being invaded and re-colonised by the united kingdom dismantling a duly elected government and legislature and replacing it with a one-man dictatorship akin to that of the old red china all in the name of good governance despite this the civilian populace was reported to be largely welcoming of the enforced rule the british government stated that they intended to keep true to their word that the country would regain home rule in two years or less and
