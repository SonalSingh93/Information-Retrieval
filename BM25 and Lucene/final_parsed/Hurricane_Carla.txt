upper-tropospheric levels surface charts indicate that a low-level circulation was developing early on september3 thus it is estimated that a tropical depression  a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than 39mph 63kmh  developed about 175 miles 282km northwest of barranquilla colombia at 1200utc initially the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data at san andrs winds shifted west at about 12mph 19kmh while barometric pressures dropped to 1,007mbar 29.7inhg the weather bureau office in miami florida issued its first bulletin at 1600utc on september4 while the depression was centered about 250 miles 400km east-southeast of cabo gracias a dios nicaraguait is estimated that sustained winds reached 45mph 75kmh at
