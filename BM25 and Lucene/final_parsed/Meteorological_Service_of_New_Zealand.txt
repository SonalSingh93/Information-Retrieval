metservice  wikipedia meteorological service of new zealand limited metservice was established as a state-owned enterprise in 1992 it employs about 250 staff and its headquarters are in wellington new zealand prior to becoming an soe new zealands national meteorological service has existed in a number of forms since the appointment of the countrys first director of meteorological stations in august 1861as new zealands national meteorological service metservice produces and issues forecasts and official weather warnings on behalf of new zealands ministry of transport and is certified by the civil aviation authority of new zealandinternational media aviation and energy business is conducted under the metraweather brandmetservice has been certified to the iso 9001 standard since november 1995the weather forecasting service began in 1861 when a spate of shipwrecks prompted the government to start a storm warning service as part of the then marine departmentforecasting remained a marine service until 1926 when it became part of the newly formed department of scientific and industrial research at the outbreak of world war two in 1939 forecasting became part of the royal new zealand air force the focus on aviation continued with a move in 1964 to the then department of civil aviation which in 1968 became part of a new super ministry the ministry of transportduring the 1980s there was increasing pressure on government funding for meteorology in new zealand together with a government-wide move to user-pays for specialised services and to more autonomy and accountability for government departments a combination of commercial competition in the deregulated market for meteorological services and reform of publicly funded science led to the establishment of metservice as a state-owned enterprise on 1 july 1992in 2013 metservice invested in a 49% shareholding in metocean solutions limited a new zealand oceanographic services company metocean is an established company specialising in oceanographic analysis for research and forecasting for many purposes including ports offshore oil  gas industries and surfersthe worlds national meteorological and hydrological services work with the world meteorological organization wmo a specialised agency of the united nations as part of the wmo world weather watch metservice sends observational data gathered from the new zealand region to other wmo member countries around the world this is used as input to computer models of the weather at the worlds major numerical weather prediction centresmetservice operates a data collection network within new zealand it complies with recognised international standards as prescribed by the wmo over and around new zealand in particular data are collected throughthe chief executive of metservice is the permanent representative of new zealand with the wmoforecasts and warnings funded by the new zealand government includemetraweather australia pty ltd metraweather uk ltd and metraweather thailand ltd are wholly owned subsidiaries of meteorological service of new zealand limited providing weather intelligence and information presentation products and services globally under the metraweather brand tometservice maintains close links with the meteorological agencies of various pacific island statesall warnings of hazardous weather for the south pacific region normally received from the regional specialized meteorological center in nadi fiji are forwarded to radio new zealand international and to the ministry of foreign affairs and trademetservice provides backup for the main warning and forecasting responsibilities of the regional specialized meteorological center in nadi fiji should that centre temporarily shut down or be cut off possibly due to a direct hit by a cyclone they also take over primary warning responsibility should a cyclone move to the south of 25sthe cooperative relationship among the worlds national meteorological services enables the sharing of much weather information including the output from global numerical weather prediction nwp models meteorologists at metservice routinely use information from the worlds major modelling centres for day-to-day production of forecasts and weather warningsthe global models that metservice uses generally provide reliable forecasts of weather features like highs and lows over forecast periods of several days however they are less effective at predicting small-scale weather features like sea breezes and localised showers such features are often strongly affected by the local geography which tends to be poorly represented in the global modelsan effective way of dealing with this problem is to use another type of nwp model known as a limited-area model metservice routinely runs a number of limited-area models based on both mm5 and wrf with lateral boundary conditions provided by each of the available global models the primary model configuration for regional forecasting in new zealand has a horizontal spacing between grid points of 12km which allows weather features down to about 50km wide to be represented highs and lows are thousands of kilometres wide this domain is nested within a much larger domain of 60km grid spacing which enables the weather to be modelled over quite a large geographical area for reasonable computational cost
