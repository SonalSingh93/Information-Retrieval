romney  hythe and dymchurch railway  wikipedia the romney hythe  dymchurch railway rhdr is a   gauge light railway in kent england operating steam and internal combustion locomotives the -mile 22.1km line runs from the cinque port of hythe via dymchurch st marys bay new romney and romney sands to dungeness close to dungeness nuclear power station and dungeness lighthousethe railway was the dream of millionaire racing drivers captain john edwards presgrave jack howey and count louis zborowski the latter had constructed a railway at higham park his home at bridge kent and agreed to donate the rolling stock and infrastructure to the project however he was killed on 19 october 1924 in a motor racing accident at the monza grand prix before the romney marsh site was chosen and howey continued the project aloneafter howey had unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ravenglass  eskdale railway and extend it he investigated a greenfield site between burnham-on-sea and weston-super-mare in somerset and offered to buy the hundred of manhood  selsey tramway in sussex henry greenly drew howeys attention to the potential for a 15-inch gauge line between new romney and hythe howey first visited new romney on 8 september 1925 and decided there and then that it was an ideal location for his proposed railwaybecause it involved crossing public highways and acquiring land from a number of different owners a light railway order made under the light railways act 1896 was necessary and application for this was made in november 1925 a public inquiry was held by the light railway commissioners in the assembly rooms at new romney on 15 and 16 january 1926 the minister of transport indicated his intention to approve the application on 19 february 1926 and the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926 was made on 26 may this incorporated the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway company as a statutory public utility undertaking gave it powers to construct and work the proposed railway and also included compulsory purchase powers over the land required which ultimately had to be used to acquire six plots of land on the proposed routeduring construction the railway was visited on 5 august 1926 by the duke of york later king george vi who drove the northern chief hauling a train of approximately 100 passengers from jesson halt to new romney and backthe railway was opened on 16 july 1927 by lord warden of the cinque ports william lygon 7th earl beauchamp the locomotives were designed by henry greenly who was commissioned by howey to work on the construction of the entire railway  and became the railways first chief engineer until his abrupt resignation in march 1929 mountain class hercules hauled the inaugural train from hythe to new romney with guests including the mayors of the two towns and general sir ivor maxsehowey was not satisfied with just  miles 13.3km of track from hythe to new romney and plans were in hand for an extension even before the original section had opened the line was to be extended  miles 9km from new romney to dungeness double-tracked throughout apart from a balloon loop on which the station at dungeness was sited a light railway order for this extension was applied for and following a public inquiry on 18 april 1928 the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway extension order was granted on 12 july 1928 ahead of this the line between new romney and the pilot had actually opened on 24 may 1928 and the rest of the line through to dungeness opened on 3 august 1928 since it was laid directly onto the shingle forming the dungeness peninsula it has been suggested that the extension was the most cheaply constructed railway in the worldin 1940 the railway was taken over by the military during world war ii and a miniature armoured train was used on the line it was also used by the department of petroleum warfare in the construction of pluto pipe line under the ocean intended to supply fuel to the allied forces after the d-day normandy landings during the latter stages of the construction of pluto considerable damage was caused to the track on the extension when to speed up the work lengths of pipe were dragged along the trackbed by bulldozers resulting in its reduction to a single track after the warthe line re-opened between hythe and new romney in 1946 the new romney to dungeness section following with a formal opening by laurel and hardy on 21 march 1947 regular services started on 29 march 1947in june 1947 the duke of westminsters railway from eaton hall cheshire was transported by the great western railway and southern railway from balderton cheshire to new romney in kent it comprised an engine nine coaches and trucks and track totalling 222 tonsin 1949 captain howey bought the duke of sutherlands private train including engine dunrobin and 60 feet 18m coach for the museum at new romney it was transported there in 1950 and displayed until sold in 1963from 7 september 1977 until 24 july 2015 the railway provided school trains to transport children to and from the marsh academy in new romney the service was finally withdrawn due to falling usagethe railways role as part of the local public transport network was extended when warren halt re-opened in 2009 providing a link to the romney marsh visitor centre further discussions with local councils took place regarding the possible expansion of burmarsh road and the provision of a new station at the gravel pits in west hythe in connection with both the proposed extensive new housing construction and the need to provide alternative transport to the a259 coast roadthe railway which carries over 150,000 passengers each year celebrated its 80th birthday in 2007 with a week of celebrations including reconstructions of scenes on the railway from the previous eight decadesfrom 1926 to 1978 the rhdr held the title of the smallest public railway in the world in terms of track gauge the title was lost to the   gauge rseau guerldan in france in 1978 and regained in 1979 when that line closed it was lost again in 1982 when the   gauge wells and walsingham light railway openedthe railway has featured in several television and radio shows including an episode of the bbc series the inspector lynley mysteries in 2006 harry secombes highway on 8 september 1991 michael bentines its a square world in 1964 bbcs multicoloured swapshop filmed on 20 february 1978  and childrens show rainbowformed in 1967 as a supporters association and regarded with some suspicion by the railways management of the time the association has become a significant contributor to the railways continuance and refurbishment it is now the largest single shareholder in the railway and its members provide a significant input of voluntary labour on both operating and maintenance work it became a registered charity on 23 january 2009 at 31 december 2015 its membership stood at 3,355stations in full or limited usethose

considerationthe line was originally laid using second-hand first world war surplus rail most was 25lbyd material rolled in the usa the rest was 12kgm rolled in belgium when the country was under german occupation in the late 1960s and early 1970s the railway managed to obtain supplies of good second-hand 30lbyd rail on the closure of the sierra leone government railway these are the oldest rails on the line some of which date from the 1890sduring the mid-1980s the company began obtaining brand new 25lbyd rail from luxembourg before switching to 30lbyd material produced british steel track products in scunthorpe and later obtained further supplies of the same from south africa the present standard rail for re-laying work is 35lbyd obtained from a manufacturer in spainthe original sleepers were creosoted baltic fir spaced at 22 inch centres these have now been entirely replaced by second-hand standard gauge sleepers cut into thirds creosoted douglas fir or jarrah and karri australian hardwoods from the eucalyptus familythe railway has a permanent way team with a full-time staff of platelayers it forms part of the larger engineering department some platelayers work all year round whilst others are diverted to other seasonal employment within the engineering department for example as summer drivers when more drivers are required than during the out of season periods additionally the permanent way team is strengthened on many days of the year especially in the winter months by volunteer workersthe longest underline bridge is collins bridge with a span of approximately 60ft the summit of the line is 20ft above ordnance datum located between hull road and taylor road lydd-onsea the ruling gradient is 1 in 75 at the dungeness end of new romney station rising from the littlestone road tunnels the tightest curve measures 6.8 chains radius and is at the hythe end of the deviation a dogleg section of track at pennypot on the outskirts of hythethe ruling gradient and tightest curve are the results of post-1972 reconstruction work pre-1990 references to these give out of date figures statements in a number of books claiming the summit of the line is at star dyke a point approximately midway between burmarsh road level crossing and willop sewer are only partly correct whilst it is the highest point between hythe and new romney  it is not the highest on the entire linethere were originally six signal boxes on the first section of the line to open hythe to new romney all were equipped with greenly designed fully interlocked lever frames constructed by jackson rigby ltd at new romney these werehythe - 16 levers controlling points and signals within the station area now the only original jackson rigby lever frame in existencepalmarsh - although this building is known to have existed there is doubt about whether the 8 lever jackson rigby frame it contained was ever fully connected up the frame was later transferred to greatstone see below the box itself had vanished by the late-1940sburmarsh road - 2 levers located in the booking office and controlling signals the station building had vanished by the mid-1950sdymchurch - confusion surrounds the number of levers in this box with different sources quoting 10 12  and 16 the box had vanished by 1963 and signalling is controlled here today by a push button electronic panel in the booking office and a 2 lever ground frame released by an annetts key normally held in the signal panelholiday camp  this building is known to have been erected on land owned by allnatt ltd since it is marked on the plans accompanying a combined conveyancelease concluded by the railway with that company and is shown as measuring 12ft by 6ft some rather poor quality photographic evidence of the existence of this box also exists there is uncertainty as to whether it was ever brought into use though and if so how many levers it containednew romney  17 levers controlling points and signals within the station area the lever frame was enlarged to the present 24 levers when the line was extended to dungeness in 1928the extension to dungeness led to the enlargement of the lever frame at new romney as mentioned above and also the opening of two new signal boxesgreatstone - the 8 lever frame originally at palmarsh was transferred here and installed in the booking

engines sold scrapped failed in trials or otherwise withdrawn all engines were internal combustion locomotivesin addition to the railways 17 own locomotives one additional engine is currently housed at new romney this is a partially constructed third-scale reproduction of an lms princess coronation class locomotive commonly known as the duchess type although of the 38 engines of this class only 10 were named after duchesses the replica was commissioned by paul riley a director of the railway as a private project and is currently stored in an engineers depot following the unexpected death of mr riley on 4 june 2008 the future of this locomotive is currently unknown it is understood that the machine is more than half completethe railway was conceived and constructed as a public service not as a tourist attraction although it now relies on tourist tradeschool children were transported under contract to kent county council to the marsh academy known as southlands comprehensive school until 2007 this service was provided all year during term time the contract ceased due to falling passenger numbers after the summer term in july 2015 local residents are transported to shopping centres and the railway has operated shoppers specials holiday camp trains have operated with camps at romney sands st marys bay and dymchurch charters are operated as required during the second world war the railway was operated by the royal engineers and later the somerset light infantry as a military railway and there was extensive transport of soldiers on troop trainsat the outset the railway was equipped with four-wheeled 8-seater coaches designed by henry greenly and his son kenneth 117 of these had been built by 1928 with only half height doors and no glazing except in the end bulkheads these were totally unsuitable for winter operation especially to dungeness in 1928 the railway took delivery of eight fully enclosed 12-seat bogie coaches built by the clayton carriage  wagon company of lincoln which incorporated electric lighting and steam heatingin 1934 howey decided to scrap all the original four-wheelers and replace them with fully enclosed bogie vehicles the 16 foot underframes for these were constructed by robert hudson ltd of leeds and the bodies were built locally by the hythe cabinet  joinery works ltd by june 1936 54 of these together with two matching vans had been taken into stockthe rhdr now operates 20-seat and 16-seat open and closed coaches these have been built on four different types of underframethe first batch of 20-seater closed coaches were bodied with utile an african hardwood - pronounced you-till-eye and numbered 51 to 61 inclusive from coach 62 onwards aluminium has been usedover 80 years the coach livery has changed from all-over green to brown and cream blue blue and cream green and cream chocolate and cream and red and cream in the late 1980s from 2000 rakes of coaches trains of around a dozen coaches have been painted in individual liveries and there are now maroon green blue crimson and teak coaches heritage coaches are chocolate and creamthe railway has built several coaches to accommodate wheelchair users starting with driving trailer coach 105 heavily re-built after extensive accident damage in 1993 and later named marjorie followed by 601 elsie then 602 winn and 603 maya new coach design featuring a lower floor for easier loading and a higher roof-line giving better headroom for wheelchair users was introduced in 2015 the first phylis is painted lined brown and normally runs with the teak coaches two further coaches iris for the green set and edith may for the teakchocolate set are under construction and will carry batteries in a compartment over one end bogie for coach lighting as well as the wheelchair compartment which has tip-up seats each will have a guards compartment with emergency brake valve vacuum gauge side ducket lookouts and a standard seating compartment the guards compartment has four seats and may be used by passengers when not in use by the guardin addition to the main stock the heritage set is made up offrom the outset the railways owners and designers envisaged freight services two of the original locomotives no 5 hercules and no 6 samson were built to the mountain wheel arrangement 4-8-2 unique on any british railway and giving the ability to haul heavy freight with only a small loss of speed when used on passenger work in the early years the railway carried a limited amount of freight mainly shingle and fish traffic a goods shed was built at new romney and featured dual gauge track allowing easy transfer between the standard and 15 inch gauges this was seldom used and was demolished in about 1934the greater part of the railways freight traffic in the early years was carried for the war department who made extensive use of the line to convey materials and equipment for the construction of the reinforced concrete sound ranging detectors they were experimenting with near greatstone a special siding was laid in joining their working site with the rhdr main line the course of which can still be traced today 2016] and the wd constructed their own locomotive to work their trainsfrom time to time the railway has had short term ad hoc freight contracts for example one in 1975 to transport drainage pipes the most recent freight workings involved delivering gas mains from new romney to greatstone in 1989 as a publicity stunt the first gas main train was steam hauled using no 4 the bug which appeared on the local tv news that eveningthe railway operates its own engineering and permanent way trains which now form the majority of its non-passenger workingsthere are several disused sidings on the beach at dungeness these were used by fishermen to help move their hauls across the shingle this joint provision was to allow transport of fish from dungeness to hythe and there to transfer it to road the company had four-wheel fish wagons stencilled fish only the service was developed from 1937 following closure of the south eastern railways dungeness line that year the fish trade developed in a small way and was withdrawn two such sidings are still in place but are both in a very poor state of repair although they were used by fishermen to transport fish across the beach for many years after the main railway service was withdrawnto facilitate the transfer of this traffic from rail to road on its arrival at hythe the track serving platform 1 there extended into the car park for some yearsthe most successful freight service was the uncrushed ballast service following withdrawal of war department operations over their siding near maddiesons camp the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains in 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed tipper wagons skips were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line and then up the main line to hythe often lying over in the sidings at dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks at hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp after the war the hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were unloaded in a siding in what is now new romney station car park the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders this practice didnt last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of new romney on the dungeness line the fence line can still be seen in 1951 after 14 years the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline at hythe the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release sidingthe railway is licensed by the post office for rail postal services and is entitled to issue postage stamps a number of first day covers have been issued a four-wheel secure postage wagon was constructedthe railway operates a casual parcels service parcels handed in at one station will be delivered to another for collection this is the last remnant of the railways freight servicesthe railway has permanent way stock examples of which includeduring world war ii a miniature armoured train was used on the line to patrol the coast in case of invasion the train was armed with a boys anti-tank rifle and lewis gunsobjectors to the railways first light railway order advocated an extension from hythe to sandling 2 miles 3.2km away to meet mainline services at sandling junction which they claimed would provide a more useful transport facility than the original proposals henry greenly undertook a preliminary survey which demonstrated the scheme was impracticablesupposition that the 4-8-2 locomotives hercules and samson were ordered for the project which involved steep inclines is unfounded as the engines were intended for freight traffic in particular a contract with kent county council to transport up to 30,000 tons of ballast a year from their pits at palmarsh in the end this contract failed to materializein the 1980s the directors reconsidered proposals to extend the line to sandling and detailed surveys were undertaken again consideration was given to motive power with new locomotives discussed although still called the sandling extension the 1980s plan was for a single-track line from pennypot 300 yards 270m short of hythe to provide a more gentle route to an area known as the roughs where a more powerful locomotive would take over for the heavy climb to sandling station it would therefore have been a branch line rather than an actual extension to the existing mainline again the project was abandoned mainly because of the same obstacles as beforethe following tenders are in useof the seven greenly tenders supplied new with locos 18 two are still in service albeit with new bodies to the original design originally built with vacuum brakes and a handbrake both brake systems have been removed leaving them as through-piped only they were coupled to hercules and samson but withdrawn from mainline service due to concerns over safety and their coal and water capacitythe southern railways ashford works built four tenders in 19467 ashford no 1 ran coupled to hercules but was built too high because john iron the southerns draughtsman sent to new romney to measure a loco took his measurements from a canadian-type pacific and not a british outline one the design of subsequent tenders was altered hurriedly after this and the second one ashford no 2 was coupled to typhoon the design was further refined and two more were constructed ashford no 3 was coupled to green goddess and ashford no 4 to southern maid ashford no 1 last ran in 1974 when hercules was withdrawn for overhaul ashford nos 2 and 3 are still in service with new bodies ashford no 4 was withdrawn when southern maid was overhauled in 1983until 1959 when its tender was cut down in size hercules ran with the cab roof raised on blocks of wood to match the height of the tenderhercules was out of service after the burmarsh road level crossing incident in 2003 and samson was withdrawn from service for an intermediate overhaul shortly afterwards once both locomotives were back in service the railway was faced with a tender shortage samson was kept from mainline service while hercules was coupled to the tender from green goddess while it was stored prior to overhaul during the 2007 season samson saw service using the tender from hurricane while it was being overhauled a situation that had also happened in 1949 when samson was used for ballast train dutiesthe railway has an exceptionally good safety record and all staff both employed and volunteer undergo extensive trainingthere have been a number of serious accidents over the railways 90 year operation with an extensive mainline timetable the majority of these have been related to level crossings and in every documented case the road user has either admitted liability or been found to have been in the wrong by the subsequent investigation despite the presence of large numbers of visitors and tourists almost all recorded level crossing incidents have involved local car drivers the more serious incidents including those at level crossings have beenfollowing the two fatal accidents in 2003 and 2005 the railway began a programme of level crossing refurbishment there are a number of occupation crossings with local control where the railway meets farm tracks but of the eighteen junctions of the railway with public highways five are road bridges and the other thirteen are level crossings during the late 1970s to early 1980s all thirteen had been converted to automatic open crossings aocls by installation of flashing warning lights between 2006 and 2016 twelve of them were upgraded to automatic barrier crossing locally monitored abcl status this involved the decommissioning of the life expired aocl control equipment the installation of lifting half-barriers and totally new control and train detection systems at a cost of around 90,000 per crossing on 22nd of march 2017 the crossing at romney sands was commissioned as an abcl this means that all the 13 crossings on the line have barriers and it brought the level crossing upgrade program to a close during the single line crossing upgrades the road signal heads wig wags have either been replaced with new ones battery road and dungeness road or had their existing heads refurbishedthe railway is owned by romney hythe  dymchurch railway plc which was originally incorporated as a private limited company on 15 november 1971 under the name rhd light railway holding company limited adopting its present title on re-registration as a new public limited company under section 8(3 of the companies act 1980 on 10 may 1982 its shareholders of whom there are now over a thousand travel free of charge on trains but receive no financial dividend on their shareholdings instead re-investing all operating profit back into the company at 14 june 2015 there were 25 gold medallion shareholders owning 5,000 or more shares each and 119 silver medallion shareholders owning between 500 and 4,999 shares each the remaining shareholders owned between 100 and 499 shares each the plcs issued and fully paid share capital at that date was 508,858 in 1 ordinary sharesshares in the plc remain available to the public at a cost of 4 each the minimum holding is 100 shares but above this number potential shareholders may purchase any amount further details can be obtained from the company secretary romney hythe  dymchurch railway plc new romney station new romney kent tn28 8plthe two largest shareholders in the plc are the romney hythe  dymchurch railway association with 78,604 shares 15.45% and sir william mcalpine bt leader of the consortium which saved the railway from closure in 1972 who holds 38,837 7.63% the plc controls the entire share capital of the older statutory romney hythe  dymchurch light railway company incorporated by the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926 it acquired a controlling interest in the statutory company on 14 february 1972 for 106,947.64 when it purchased 50,447 of the 51,000 statutory company shares then in issue since february 1972 it has bought out all of the minority shareholders in the statutory company which is now a wholly owned subsidiarythe romney hythe  dymchurch light railway amendment order 1974 altered the capital structure of the statutory company allowing its issued share capital and borrowings to amount in aggregate to 400,000 instead of the previously completely inadequate 68,000 on 1 october 1975 the statutory company created a further 24,000 new shares bringing its issued capital up to 75,000 in 1 shares the plc subscribed for 23,950 of these new shares and the remaining 50 were acquired by a director of the statutory company in order to bring their holding up to the minimum for directors of 250 shares specified in the 1926 light railway order directors shareholdings in the statutory company are subject to rights of pre-emption by the plc and are therefore treated for most purposes as being owned by that companyit is usual for the two companies to share the same board of directors with the anomaly that whilst the romney hythe  dymchurch railway association has been granted a seat on the statutory companys board it has no direct representation on the plcs boardthe romney hythe  dymchurch light railway order 1926  restricted the maximum number of directors of the statutory company to five and named captain john edwards presgrave howey gladys may howey captain john alexander holder major william bertram bell and henry greenly as the first directors greenly never owned more than 50 shares in the company so was ineligible to sit on the board and holder did not achieve the qualifying holding of 250 shares until 30 december 1929 gladys howey was also ineligible until 1931 when her shareholding reached 250 and she was able to join the boardsection 5 of the romney hythe  dymchurch light railway amendment order 1974  increased the maximum number of directors from five to 10 and also set the minimum number of directors at threethe day-to-day operation of the railway is in the hands of a full-time permanent staff of around 35 assisted by 5 part-time permanent staff these include a general manager departmental managers engineering commercial and operations and a large number of engineering staff from locomotive fitters to permanent way gangers and catering staff the new romney and dungeness cafes and the light railway restaurant adjoining hythe station are open all year round some of the railways other commercial outlets are more seasonal in addition to this core staff seasonal employees are taken on through the summer season particularly to increase the staffing of the shops and catering outlets and to provide the required levels of staffing at stations at the height of the operating season there are over 60 staff on the payrollthe railway depends upon a dedicated team of fully trained but unpaid volunteer staff members who work on the railway in their own spare time volunteer staff work throughout the railway in engineering posts operating positions commercial outlets and manual roles concerned with maintenance and improvement
