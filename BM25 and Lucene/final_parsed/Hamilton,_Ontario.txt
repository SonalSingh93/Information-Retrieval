legislative assembly which established a new gore district of which the hamilton townsite was a memberinitially this town was not the most important centre of the gore district an early indication of hamiltons sudden prosperity was signaled by the fact that in 1816 it was chosen over ancaster ontario that year to be the administrative center for the new gore district another dramatic economic turnabout for hamilton occurred in 1832 when a canal was finally cut through the outer sand bar that enabled hamilton to become a major port a permanent jail was not constructed until 1832 when a

were surveyed and named the area was first known as the head-of-the-lake for its location at the western end of lake ontario john ryckman born in barton township where present day downtown hamilton is described the area in 1803 as he remembered it the city in 1803 was all forest the shores of the bay were difficult to reach or see because they were hidden by a thick almost impenetrable mass of trees and undergrowth bears ate pigs so settlers warred on bears wolves gobbled sheep and geese so they hunted and trapped wolves they also held organized raids on rattlesnakes on the mountainside there was plenty of game many a time have i seen sic a deer jump the fence into my back yard and there were millions of pigeons which we clubbed as they flew lowgeorge hamilton a settler and local politician established a town site in the northern portion of barton township in 1815 he kept several eastwest roads which were originally indian trails but the northsouth streets were on a regular grid pattern streets were designated east or west if they crossed james street or highway 6 streets were designated north or south if they crossed king street or highway 8 the overall design of the townsite likely conceived in 1816 was commonplace george hamilton employed a grid street pattern used in most towns in upper canada and throughout the american frontier the eighty original lots had frontages of fifty feet each lot faced a broad street and backed onto a twelve-foot lane it took at least a decade for all of the original lots to be sold but the construction of the burlington canal in 1823 and a new court-house in 1827 encouraged hamilton to add more blocks around 18289 at this time he included a market square in an effort to draw commercial activity onto his lands but the
