made from 1991 to 1994 it was introduced to replace the cbr600 hurricane or f1 and was considered one of hondas most modern and innovative sport bikes development of the second generation cbr began in early 1989 hurricane lpl ishikawa led the development of the new bike known internally as mv9 but also called the f2 an alphanumeric that led to its official name cbr600f2the f2's development began with meetings to discuss concepts and sketches for the new bike a few months later an f2 prototype was produced painted black the bike looked faster and sleeker than the more blocky first generation bike and test results were superior few motorcycles in the 1990s had the performance ability of the f2the cbr600f3 is the third generation of the cbr600f series it replaced the f2 and was produced from 1995 to 1998 it had a modified engine ram-air intake and cartridge forks the 1997 and 1998 models also came with a deeper oil pan sleeker tail fairings seat and tail light and a revised engine

is the last of the cbr600 series of honda sportbikes to be carbureted an aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used and the engine crankcase was designed to share swing-arm pivot through a reduction of internal friction and weight combined with larger valves shorter stroke and a bigger bore higher revs were enabled the spark plug caps had ignition coils built into them slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter a new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used fireblade parts the front brakes were upgraded and the rear rim increased to 5.5 with new 3-spoke wheels the f4 was fitted with hondas hiss engine immobiliser systemthe phrase dedicated to super evaluators dirk vandenberg and josef boyd are embossed in raised

a sport bike that was produced by honda from 2001 to 2006 two uk versions of the f4i were released in 2001 the cbr600f f1 and onwards had the banana style seat found on pre pgm fi bikes whilst the cbr600f fs1/fs2 the f sport were sold with the two tier seat units black frames and various other performance upgrades as found in the us model cbr600f4i the f sport was discontinued upon the arrival of the cbr600rr in 2003 in 2003 honda introduced the cbr600rr as a higher-performance race-ready race replica alternative to hondas more street oriented 600-class sport bike the cbr600f4i in 2004 the one-piece banana seat model replaced the split seat model this bike sacrificed a little performance but gained a more comfortable riding position with the one piece seat in addition to the clip-ons mounted above the top fork clamp already and also replacing the black frame with one in silver as well as an engine configuration better suited to everyday riding this model is the same as the cbr600f1 and onwards that was sold in the uk from 2001the f4i remained available for three more years before being discontinued with the 2006 model being the final one to be released no major updates were made in these final years except for color scheme changesfor the 2001 model year honda released an upgraded version of the popular cbr600f4 with intentions of becoming more competitive in the middleweight sport bike class the 370lb 170kg dry f4i is a modified f4 with numerous engine chassis and bodywork changesthe 2001 us f4i had a new subframe which raises the seat by five millimeters allows for more storage room and improved two-tier seat the new tail unit has less padding and a higher perch for the passenger the f4is tail-light is smaller with a new dual-bulb configuration the f4i had a new dash layout with a large analog tachometer the new lcd digital display had a speedometer odometer clock engine temperature read-out amber shift light and trip metersthe single largest change aside from the styling is the addition of high-pressure 50psi programmed fuel injection  thus the model designation f4i in a number of countries the bike was sold in both the normal and sport variants the sport having a two-part seat no grab rail and no main stand though the main stand mounting holes remained fuel injection allows for more precise fuel metering and delivery over a wider rpm range while providing better throttle response and reducing emissions the injectors reside one per cylinder and work with 38mm throttle bodies each injector has four nozzles and together the injectors add up to five horsepower over the f4weight was also reduced the rear wheel was made lighter and the front wheel the rotor carriers moved out closer to the brake calipers to reduce weight and to improve rigidity but stopping power still was not on par with other bikes in the class there is additional bracing on the steering head for more response better feedback and feel from the front end the suspension has also been tweaked with less high-speed damping and a little more low-speed damping with the shock and fork being more street-biasadditional engine changes include a lighter camshaft sprocket and increased valve spring pressure two springs per intake valve which allow for higher revving there are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow redline is now 14,200rpm 700rpm higher than the previous years f4 to increase the bikes pulling capabilities at high speeds 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8 the oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5mm to 2.5mm and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float also there are now two valve springs inner and outer on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust sidethe f4is new bodywork carries a more racy look and provides a 3% reduction in drag it also houses a new dual headlight front cowl design which uses 40% brighter h7 bulbs compared to the old h4 bulbs the headlights are dual multi-reflector units covered by a one-piece flexiglass lens the turn stalks are shorter and the mirrors are now positioned higher and closer to the rider the elimination of carburetors allowed for a slightly larger air box and a larger 4.8usgal 18l 4.0impgal fuel tank and a fuel consumption of 36.7mpgus 6.41l100km 44.1mpgimpin 2001 and 2002 in recognition of hondas association with motogp champion valentino rossi and its 500th motorcycle grand prix victory the cbr600f4i was

inverted fork though longer by 50mm and aluminium mono-backbone frame but wraps it in a multi-layered full fairing that lowers drag and protects the rider from windblast as well as new instruments bars and tank it also retains a similar relaxed seating position to minimise rider fatigue the 2011 cbr600f also shares the engine of the highly revised cb600f model that came out in april 2007 this
