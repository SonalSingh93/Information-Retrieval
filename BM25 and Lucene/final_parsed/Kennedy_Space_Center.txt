kennedy space center  wikipedia the john f kennedy space center ksc is one of ten national aeronautics and space administration field centers since december 1968 kennedy space center has been nasas primary launch center of human spaceflight launch operations for the apollo skylab and space shuttle programs were carried out from kennedy space center launch complex 39 and managed by ksc located on the east coast of florida ksc is adjacent to cape canaveral air force station ccafs the management of the two entities work very closely together share resources and even own facilities on each others propertythough the first apollo flights and all project mercury and project gemini flights took off from ccafs the launches were managed by ksc and its previous organization the launch operations directorate starting with the fourth gemini mission the nasa launch control center in florida mercury control center later the launch control center began handing off control of the vehicle to the mission control center shortly after liftoff in prior missions it held control throughout the entire missionadditionally the center manages launch of robotic and commercial crew missions researches food production and in-situ resource utilization for off earth exploration and more since 2010 the center has worked to become a multi-user spaceport through industry partnerships even adding a new launch pad lc-39c in 2015there are about 700 facilities grouped across the centers 144,000 acres among the unique facilities at ksc are the 525ft tall vehicle assembly building for stacking nasas largest rockets the operations and checkout building which houses the astronaut crew quarters and 3-mile-long shuttle landing facility there is also a visitor complex open to the public on sitethe military had been performing launch operations since 1949 at what would become cape canaveral air force station in december 1959 the department of defense transferred 5,000 personnel and the missile firing laboratory to nasa to become the launch operations directorate under nasas marshall space flight centerpresident john f kennedys 1961 goal of a manned lunar landing before 1970 required an expansion of launch operations on july 1 1962 the launch operations directorate was separated from msfc to become the launch operations center loc also cape canaveral was inadequate to host the new launch facility design required for the mammoth 363-foot 111m tall 7,500,000-pound-force 33,000kn thrust saturn v rocket which would be assembled vertically in a large hangar and transported on a mobile platform to one of several launch pads therefore the decision was made to build a new loc site located adjacent to cape canaveral on merritt islandnasa began land acquisition in 1962 buying title to 131 square miles 340km and negotiating with the state of florida for an additional 87 square miles 230km the major buildings in kscs industrial area were designed by architect charles luckman construction began in november 1962 and kennedy visited the site twice in 1962 and again just a week before his assassination on november 22 1963on november 29 1963 the facility was given its current name by president lyndon b johnson under executive order 11129 johnsons order joined both the civilian loc and the military cape canaveral station the facilities of station no 1 of the atlantic missile range under the designation john f kennedy space center spawning some confusion joining the two in the public mind nasa administrator james e webb clarified this by issuing a directive stating the kennedy space center name applied only to the loc while the air force issued a general order renaming the military launch site cape kennedy air force stationlocated on merritt island florida the center is north-northwest of cape canaveral on the atlantic ocean midway between miami and jacksonville on floridas space coast due east of orlando it is 34 miles 55km long and roughly six miles 9.7km wide covering 219 square miles 570kmksc is a major central florida tourist destination and is approximately one hours drive from the orlando area the kennedy space center visitor complex offers public tours of the center and cape canaveral air force stationbecause much of the installation is a restricted area and only nine percent of the land is developed the site also serves as an important wildlife sanctuary mosquito lagoon indian river merritt island national wildlife refuge and canaveral national seashore are other features of the area center workers can encounter bald eagles american alligators wild boars eastern diamondback rattlesnakes the endangered florida panther and florida manateesfrom 1967 through 1973 there were 13 saturn v launches including the ten remaining apollo missions after apollo 7 the first of two unmanned flights apollo 4 apollo-saturn 501 on november 9 1967 was also the first rocket launch from ksc the saturn vs first manned launch on december 21 1968 was apollo 8's lunar orbiting mission the next two missions tested the lunar module apollo 9 earth orbit and apollo 10 lunar orbit apollo 11 launched from pad a on july 16 1969 made the first moon landing on july 20 apollo 12 followed four months later from 19701972 the apollo program concluded at ksc with the launches of missions 13 through 17on may 14 1973 the last saturn v launch put the skylab space station in orbit from pad 39a by this time the cape kennedy pads 34 and 37 used for the saturn ib were decommissioned and pad b was modified to launch three manned missions to skylab that year as well as the final apollo spacecraft for the apollosoyuz test project in 1975as the space shuttle was being designed nasa received proposals for building alternative launch-and-landing sites at locations other than ksc which demanded study ksc had important advantages including its existing facilities location on the intracoastal waterway and its southern latitude which gives a velocity advantage to missions launched in easterly near-equatorial orbits disadvantages included its inability to safely launch military missions into polar orbit since spent boosters would be likely to fall on the carolinas or cuba corrosion from the salt air and frequent cloudy or stormy weather although building a new site at white sands missile range in new mexico was seriously considered nasa announced its decision in april 1972 to use ksc for the shuttle since the shuttle could not be landed automatically or by remote control the launch of columbia on april 12 1981 for its first orbital mission sts-1 was nasas first manned launch of a vehicle that had not been tested in prior unmanned launchesin 1976 the vabs south parking area was the site of third century america a science and technology display commemorating the us bicentennial concurrent with this event the us flag was painted on the south side of the vab during the late 1970s lc-39 was reconfigured to support the space shuttle two orbiter processing facilities were built near the vab as hangars with a third added in the 1980skscs 2.9-mile 4.7km shuttle landing facility slf was the orbiters primary end-of-mission landing site although the first ksc landing did not take place until the tenth flight when challenger completed sts-41-b on february 11 1984 the primary landing site until then was edwards air force base in california subsequently used as a backup landing site the slf also provided a return-to-launch-site rtls abort option which was not utilized the slf is among the longest runways in the worldafter 24 successful shuttle flights challenger was torn apart 73 seconds after the launch of sts-51-l on january 28 1986 the first shuttle launch from pad 39b and the first us manned launch failure killing the seven crew members an o-ring seal in the right booster rocket failed at liftoff leading to subsequent structural failures flights resumed on september 29 1988 with sts-26 after modifications to many aspects of the shuttle programon february 1 2003 columbia and her crew of seven were lost during re-entry over texas during the sts-107 mission the 113th shuttle flight a vehicle breakup triggered by damage sustained during launch from pad 39a on january 16 when a piece of foam insulation from the orbiters external fuel tank struck the orbiters left wing during reentry the damage created a hole allowing hot gases to melt the wing structure like the challenger disaster the resulting investigation and modifications interrupted shuttle flight operations at ksc for more than two years until the sts-114 launch on july 26 2005the shuttle program experienced five main engine shutdowns at lc-39 all within four seconds before launch and one abort to orbit sts-51-f on july 29 1985 shuttle missions during nearly 30 years of operations included deploying satellites and interplanetary probes conducting space science and technology experiments visits to the russian mir space station construction and servicing of the international space station deployment and servicing of the hubble space telescope and serving as a space laboratory the shuttle was retired from service in july 2011 after 135 launcheson october 28 2009 the ares i-x launch from pad 39b was the first unmanned launch from ksc since the skylab workshop in 1973beginning in 1958 nasa and military worked side by side on robotic mission launches previously referred to as unmanned cooperating as they broke ground in the field in the early 1960s nasa had as many as two robotic mission launches a month the frequent number of flights allowed for quick evolution of the vehicles as engineers gathered data learned from anomalies and implemented upgrades in 1963 with the intent of ksc elv work focusing on the ground support equipment and facilities a separate atlascentaur organization was formed under nasas lewis center now glenn research center grc taking that responsibility from the launch operations center aka kscthough almost all robotics missions launched from the cape canaveral air force station ccafs ksc oversaw the final assembly and testing of rockets as they arrived at the cape in 1965 kscs unmanned launch operations directorate became responsible all nasa unmanned launch operations including those at vandenberg air force base from the 1950s to 1978 ksc chose the rocket and payload processing facilities for all robotic missions launching in the us overseeing their near launch processing and checkout in addition to government missions ksc performed this service for commercial and foreign missions also though non-us government entities provided reimbursement nasa also funded ccafs launch pad maintenance and launch vehicle improvementsall this changed with the commercial space launch act of 1984 after which nasa only coordinated its own and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa elv launches companies were able to operate their own launch vehicles and utilize nasas launch facilities payload processing handled by private firms also started to occur outside of ksc reagans 1988 space policy furthered the movement of this work from ksc to commercial companies that same year launch complexes on ccafs started transferring from nasa to air force managementin the 1990s though ksc was not performing the hands-on elv work engineers still maintained understanding of elvs and had contracts allowing them insight in the vehicles so they could provide knowledgeable oversight ksc also worked on elv research and analysis and the contractors were able to utilize ksc personnel as a resource for technical issues ksc with the payload and launch vehicle industries developed advances in automation of the elv launch and ground operations for the purpose of enabling competitiveness of us rockets against the global marketin 1998 the launch services program lsp formed at ksc pulling together programs and personnel that already existed at ksc grc goddard space flight center and more to manage the launch of nasa and noaa robotic missions ccafs and vafb are the primary launch sites for lsp missions though other sites are occasionally used lsp payloads such as the mars science laboratory have been processed at ksc before being transferred to a launch pad on ccafsas the international space station modules design began in the early 1990s ksc began to work with other nasa centers and international partners to prepare for processing prior to launch on board the space shuttles ksc utilized its hands-on experience processing the 22 spacelab missions in the operations and checkout building to gather expectations of iss processing these experiences were incorporated into the design of the space station processing facility sspf which began construction in 1993 the space station directorate formed in 1996 ksc personnel were embedded at station module factories for insight into their processesfrom 1997 to 2007 ksc planned and performed on the ground integration tests and checkouts of station modules three multi-element integration testing meit sessions and the integration systems test ist numerous issues were found and corrected that would have been difficult to nearly impossible to do on-orbittoday ksc continues to process iss payloads from across the world prior to launch along with developing its own experiments for on orbitthe following are current programs and initiatives at kennedy space centerthe ksc industrial area where many of the centers support facilities are located is 5 miles 8km south of lc-39 it includes the headquarters building the operations and checkout building and the central instrumentation facility the astronaut crew quarters are in the oc before it was completed the astronaut crew quarters were located in hangar s at the cape canaveral missile test annex now ccafs located as ksc was the merritt island spaceflight tracking and data network station mila a key radio communications and spacecraft tracking complexfacilities at the kennedy space center are directly related to its mission to launch and in some cases recover missions facilities are available to prepare and maintain spacecraft and payloads for flight the headquarters hq building houses offices for the center director library film and photo archives a print shop and security a new headquarters building is under construction as a part of the central campus consolidation and the first phase is expected to be complete in 2017the center operated its own 17-mile 27km short-line railroad this operation was discontinued in 2015 with the sale of its final two locomotives a third had already been donated to a museum the line was costing 1.3 million annually to maintainlaunch complex 39 lc-39 was originally built for the saturn v the largest and most powerful operational launch vehicle in history for the apollo manned moon landing program since the end of the apollo program in 1972 lc-39 has been used to launch every nasa human space flight including skylab 1973 the apollo-soyuz test project 1975 and the space shuttle program 1981-2011since december 1968 all launch operations have been conducted from launch pads a and b at lc-39 both pads are on the ocean 3 miles 4.8km east of the vab from 19691972 lc-39 was the departure point for all six apollo manned moon landing missions using the saturn v and was used from 19812011 for all space shuttle launcheshuman missions to the moon required the large three-stage saturn v rocket which was 363 feet 111 meters tall and 33 feet 10 meters in diameter at ksc launch complex 39 lc-39 was built on merritt island to accommodate the new rocket construction of the 800million project began in november 1962 lc-39 pads a and b were completed by october 1965 planned pads c d and e were canceled the vab was completed in june 1965 and the infrastructure by late 1966the complex includesas a part of promoting commercial space industry growth in the area and the overall center as a multi-user spaceport ksc leases some of its properties here are some major examplesthe kennedy space center visitor complex operated by delaware north since 1995 has a variety of exhibits artifacts displays and attractions on the history and future of human and robotic spaceflight bus tours of ksc originate from here the complex also includes the separate apollosaturn v center north of the vab and the united states astronaut hall of fame six miles west near titusville there were 1.5million visitors in 2009 it had some 700 employeesit was announced on may 29 2015 that the astronaut hall of fame exhibit would be moved from its current location to another location within the visitor complex to make room for an upcoming high-tech attraction entitled heroes and legends the attraction to be designed by orlando-based design firm falcons treehouse is slated to open sometime late 2016in march 2016 the visitor center unveiled the new location of the iconic countdown clock at the complexs entrance previously the clock was located with a flagpole at the press site the clock was originally built and installed in 1969 and listed with the flagpole in the national register of historic places in january 2000nasa lists the following historic districts at ksc each district has multiple associated facilitiesthere are 24 historic properties outside of these historic districts including the space shuttle atlantis vehicle assembly building crawlerway and operations and checkout building ksc has one national historic landmark 78 national register of historic places nrhp listed or eligible sites and 100 archaeological sitesfloridas peninsular shape and temperature contrasts between land and ocean provide ideal conditions for electrical storms earning central florida the reputation as lightning capital of the united states this makes extensive lightning protection and detection systems necessary to protect employees structures and spacecraft on launch pads on november 14 1969 apollo 12 was struck by lightning just after lift-off from pad 39a but the flight continued safely the most powerful lightning strike recorded at ksc occurred at lc-39b on august 25 2006 while shuttle atlantis was being prepared for sts-115 nasa managers were initially concerned that the lightning strike caused damage to atlantis but none was foundon september 7 2004 hurricane frances directly hit the area with sustained winds of 70 miles per hour 110kmh and gusts up to 94 miles per hour 151kmh the most damaging storm to date the vehicle assembly building lost 1,000 exterior panels each 3.9 feet 1.2m x 9.8 feet 3.0m in size this exposed 39,800sqft 3,700m of the building to the elements damage occurred to the south and east sides of the vab the shuttles thermal protection system facility suffered extensive damage the roof was partially torn off and the interior suffered water damage several rockets on display in the center were toppled further damage to ksc was caused by hurricane wilma in october 2005since kscs formation ten nasa officials have served as directors including three former astronauts crippen bridges and cabanawhen ksc separated from marshall space flight center in july 1962 it took 375 employees with itin may 1965 ksc had 7,000 employees and contractors move from rented space in cocoa beach to the new merritt island facilities the peak number of persons working on center was 26,000 in 1968 3,000 were civil servants in 1970 president nixon announced intent to reduce cost of space operations and major cuts occurred at ksc by 1974 kscs workforce was down to 10,000 employees 2,408 civil servantsa total of 13,100 people worked at the center as of 2011 approximately 2,100 are employees of the federal government the rest are contractors the average annual salary for an on-site worker in 2008 was 77,235the end of the space shuttle program in 2011 preceded by the cancellation of constellation program in 2010 produced a significant downsizing of the ksc workforce similar to that experienced at the end of the apollo program in 1972 as part of this downsizing 6,000 contractors lost their jobs at the center during 2010 and 2011
