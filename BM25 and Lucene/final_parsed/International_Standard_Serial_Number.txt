international standard serial number  wikipedia an international standard serial number issn is an eight-digit serial number used to uniquely identify a serial publication the issn is especially helpful in distinguishing between serials with the same title issn are used in ordering cataloging interlibrary loans and other practices in connection with serial literaturethe issn system was first drafted as an international organization for standardization iso international standard in 1971 and published as iso 3297 in 1975 iso subcommittee tc 46/sc 9 is responsible for maintaining the standardwhen a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type a different issn is assigned to each media type for example many serials are published both in print and electronic media the issn system refers to these types as print issn p-issn and electronic issn e-issn respectively conversely as defined in iso 3297:2007 every serial in the issn system is also assigned a linking issn issn-l typically the same as the issn assigned to the serial in its first published medium which links together all issns assigned to the serial in every mediumthe format of the issn is an eight digit code divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers as an integer number it can be represented by the first seven digits the last code digit which may be 0-9 or an x is a check digit formally the general form of the issn code also named issn structure or issn syntax can be expressed as followsor by a perl compatible regular expressions pcre regular expressionthe issn of the journal hearing research for example is 0378-5955 where the final 5 is the check digit that is c5 to calculate the check digit the following algorithm may be usedto confirm the check digit calculate the sum of all eight digits of the issn multiplied by its position in the number counting from the right if the check digit is x then add 10 to the sum the modulus 11 of the sum must be 0there is an online issn checker that can validate an issn based on the above algorithmissn codes are assigned by a network of issn national centres usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the issn international centre based in paris the international centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between unesco and the french government the international centre maintains a database of all issns assigned worldwide the isds register international serials data system otherwise known as the issn register at the end of 2016 the issn register contained records for 1,943,572 itemsissn and isbn codes are similar in concept where isbns are assigned to individual books an isbn might be assigned for particular issues of a serial in addition to the issn code for the serial as a whole an issn unlike the isbn code is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title containing no information as to the publisher or its location for this reason a new issn is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title changesince the issn applies to an entire serial a new identifier the serial item and contribution identifier sici was built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes articles or other identifiable components like the table of contentsseparate issns are needed for serials in different media except reproduction microforms thus the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate issns also a cd-rom version and a web version of a serial require different issns since two different media are involved however the same issn can be used for different file formats eg pdf and html of the same online serialthis media-oriented identification of serials made sense in the 1970s in the 1990s and onward with personal computers better screens and the web it makes sense to consider only content independent of media this content-oriented identification of serials was a repressed demand during a decade but no issn update or initiative occurred a natural extension for issn the unique-identification of the articles in the serials was the main demand application an alternative serials contents model arrived with the indecs content model and its application the digital object identifier doi as issn-independent initiative consolidated in the 2000sonly later in 2007 issn-l was defined in the new issn standard iso 3297:2007 as an issn designated by the issn network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different mediathe issn register is not freely available for interrogation on the web but is available by subscription there are several routes to the identification and verification of issn codes for the publican issn can be encoded as a uniform resource name urn by prefixing it with urnissn for example rail could be referred to as urnissn0953-4563" urn namespaces are case-sensitive and the issn namespace is all caps if the checksum digit is x then it is always encoded in uppercase in a urnthe util urns are content-oriented but issn is media-orienteda unique urn for serials simplifies the search recovery and delivery of data for various services including in particular search systems and knowledge databases issn-l see linking issn below was created to fill this gapthere are two most popular media types that adopted special labels indicating below in italics and one in fact issn-variant with also an optional label all are used in standard metadata context like jats and the labels also frequently as abbreviationsp-issn is a standard label for print issn the issn for the print media paper version of a serial usually it is the default media so the default issne-issn or eissn is a standard label for electronic issn the issn for the electronic media online version of a serialissn-l is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media as defined by iso 3297:2007 the linking issn issn-l provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resourcethe issn-l is one issn number among the existing issns so does not change the use or assignment of ordinary issns it is based on the issn of the first published medium version of the publication if the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time the issn of the print version is chosen as the basis of the issn-lwith issn-l is possible to designate one single issn for all those media versions of the title the use of issn-l facilitates search retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like openurl library catalogues search engines or knowledge bases
