captain tana umaga pushed out former all black pita alatini and saw him score six tries en route to the all black squad the team also benefited from the steady hand of david holwell at first five-eighth and an improving and mobile forward pack hurricanes stalwart christian cullen would leave new zealand shores for irish club munster after his omission from the all blacks 2003 world cup squad despite scoring eight tries during the seasonall black great jonah lomu was left out of the 2004 squad due to a life-threatening illness that would eventually result in a kidney transplant he
