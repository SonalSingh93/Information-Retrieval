joule  wikipedia the joule  symbol j is a derived unit of energy in the international system of units it is equal to the energy transferred to or work done on an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre 1 newton metre or nm it is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second it is named after the english physicist james prescott joule 18181889in terms firstly of base si units and then in terms of other si unitswhere kg is the kilogram m is the metre s is the second n is the newton pa is the pascal w is the watt c is the coulomb and v is the voltone joule can also be defined asthis si unit is named after james prescott joule as with every international system of units si unit named for a person the first letter of its symbol is upper case j however when an si unit is spelled out in english it should always begin with a lower case letter jouleexcept in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case note that degree celsius conforms to this rule because the d is lowercasebased on the international system of units section 5.2in mechanics the concept of force in some direction has a close analog in the concept of torque about some anglea result of this similarity is that the si unit for torque is the newton metre which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule but they are not interchangeable the cgpm has given the unit of energy the name joule but has not given the unit of torque any special name hence it is simply the newton metre nm  a compound name derived from its constituent parts the use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunicationsthe distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar  the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement by contrast torque is a vector  the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector torque and energy are related to one another by the equationwhere e is energy  is the vector magnitude of torque and  is the angle swept in radians since radians are dimensionless it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensionsone joule in everyday life represents approximatelysince the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kwh kilowatt-hour a kwh is thus 1000w  3600s  3.6mj megajoulesthe zeptojoule zj is equal to one sextillionth 10 of one joule 160 zeptojoules is about one electronvoltthe nanojoule nj is equal to one billionth 10 of one joule 160 nanojoules is about the kinetic energy of a flying mosquitothe microjoule j is equal to one millionth 10 of one joule the large hadron collider lhc produces collisions of the microjoule order 7 tev per particlethe millijoule mj is equal to one thousandth 10 of a joulethe kilojoule kj is equal to one thousand 10 joules nutritional food labels in most countries express energy in kilojoules kjone square metre of the earth receives about 1.4 kilojoules of solar radiation every second in full daylightthe megajoule mj is equal to one million 10 joules or approximately the kinetic energy of a one megagram tonne vehicle moving at 161kmhthe energy required to heat 10 liters of liquid water at constant pressure from 0c 32f to 100c 212f is approximately 4.2mjone kilowatt hour of electricity is 3.6 megajoulesthe gigajoule gj is equal to one billion 10joules 6gj is about the chemical energy of combusting 1 barrel 159l of crude oil 2gj is about the planck energy unitthe terajoule tj is equal to one trillion 10 joules or about 0.278 gwh which is often used in energy tables about 63 tj of energy was released by the atomic bomb that exploded over hiroshima the international space station with a mass of approximately 450 megagrams and orbital velocity of 7.7kms has a kinetic energy of roughly 13 tj in 2017 hurricane irma was estimated to have a peak wind energy of 112 tjthe petajoule pj is equal to one quadrillion 10 joules 210pj is about 50megatons of tnt this is the amount of energy released by the tsar bomba the largest man-made explosion everthe exajoule ej is equal to 10 one quintillion joules the 2011 thoku earthquake and tsunami in japan had 1.41ej of energy according to its rating of 9.0 on the moment magnitude scale yearly us energy consumption amounts to roughly 94ejthe zettajoule zj is equal to one sextillion 10 joules the human annual global energy consumption is approximately 0.5 zjthe yottajoule yj is equal to one septillion 10 joules this is approximately the amount of energy required to heat all the water on earth by 1c the thermal output of the sun is approximately 400 yj per second1 joule is equal tounits defined exactly in terms of the joule include
