hurricane carol  wikipedia hurricane carol was among the worst tropical cyclones on record to affect the states of connecticut and rhode island in the united states it developed from a tropical wave near the bahamas on august 25 1954 and slowly strengthened as it moved northwestward on august 27 carol intensified to reach winds of 105mph 165kmh but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift a strong trough of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward and carol later intensified into a major hurricane while paralleling the mid-atlantic and southeastern united states the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and slight damage to houses in north carolina virginia washington dc delaware and new jersey the well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on eastern long island new york and then over eastern connecticut on august31 with sustained winds estimated at 110-mph and a barometric pressure near 956 mb carol transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over new hampshire later on august 31 1954in new york strong winds on long island damaged about 1,000 houses left 275,000people without electricity downed many trees and resulted in heavy crop losses storm surge flooded laguardia airport and inundated the montauk highway which left the eastern portion of long island isolated carol also brought strong winds and rough seas to coastal connecticut rhode island and southeastern massachusetts throughout the region about 150,000people were left without electricity and telephone service 1,545houses were destroyed and another 9,720were damaged approximately 3,500cars and 3,000boats were destroyed there were 65deaths and 1,000injuries in new england the storm caused an additional 1million in damage in canada as well as two deaths overall carol caused 72fatalities and damage totaled 462million 1954usd making it the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states at the time following the storm carol was retired becoming the first name to be removed from the naming lists in the atlantic basina tropical wave spawned a tropical depression over the northeastern bahamas on august25 it moved to the north-northwest and intensified into a tropical storm early on august26 receiving the name carol the storm gradually turned to the north and strengthened under generally favorable conditions on august26 the hurricane hunters reported an eye 23 miles 37km in diameter despite carol being a tropical storm the next day carol strengthened to attain hurricane status while located about 345miles 545km east of cape canaveral florida with a large anticyclone persisting across the southeastern united states the motion of carol turned to a northwest drift the hurricane continued to strengthen and carol reached an initial peak intensity of 105mph 165kmh on august28 by that time it was a small hurricane and the radius of maximum winds was smaller than normal for its latitude and central pressure after maintaining peak intensity for 30hours and moving a distance of about 75miles 120km carol weakened slightly off the coast of georgiaan eastward moving deep-wave trough intensified as it moved through the eastern united states this caused carol to accelerate as it turned to the north and north-northeast on august30 the hurricane again strengthened to reach category 2 status while located 180miles 290km east of savannah georgia early on august31 carol passed very near cape hatteras north carolina with reconnaissance aircraft intensity estimates from 75125mph 120200kmh the hurricane continued north-northeastward with a forward motion of up to 39mph 63kmh and carol intensified further to make landfall on eastern long island a category 3 hurricane with peak winds of 111mph 185kmh after quickly crossing long island sound the hurricane made landfall again near groton connecticut carol had maintained its small structure and well-defined eye and observers on both eastern long island and groton connecticut reported blue skies and light winds as the eye passed overhead followed by strong hurricane force winds the landfall intensity was based on a pressure of 957mbar 28.3inhg recorded in groton connecticut ninety percent of homes in the groton long point area were destroyed by the storm surge and winds in hurricane carol carol quickly lost tropical characteristics while crossing into inland eastern massachusetts and became extratropical over southwestern new hampshire late on august31 the powerful extratropical storm continued northward and after entering canada lost its identity over southern quebecbefore affecting north carolina the threat of carol prompted a hurricane warning from wilmington to manteo storm warnings were issued southward to charleston residents evacuated north of wilmington along the ocean while passing by the state the strongest winds remained to the east of hurricane carol though winds of 90 to 100mph 145 to 160kmh were reported at cape hatteras further inland the hurricane produced a wind gust of 55mph 90kmh in wilmington and 65mph 105kmh in cherry point the winds resulted in agricultural damage to the corn and soy bean crop high winds caused minor damage to roofs and houses and also downed some trees and power lines near the coast waves from the storm damaged fishing piers and flooding was reported in new bern high waves also damaged coastal roadways damage in the state totaled to around 228,000 carol passed 100miles 160km to the east of virginia and produced 40mph 65kmh winds in virginia beach the hurricane produced 4inches 100mm of rain in norfolk further to the northwest rainfall from the system alleviated drought conditions in the washington dc area damage was minor from virginia to delaware where light rains fell precipitation also extended into pennsylvaniain new jersey high winds downed power lines which killed two people along the coast high waves damaged boardwalks and caused flooding in neighboring pennsylvania carol caused a tractor to crash into a train resulting in two deaths damage in the state was estimated at 250,000on eastern long island near where carol made landfall a pressure of 960mbar 28inhg was recorded winds on the island gusted to 125mph 200kmh leaving thousands of homes without power the winds downed many trees and left heavy crop damage to various fruits high winds damaged widespread homes boats and cars about 1,000houses were damaged on the island and 275,000people lost power the hurricanes storm surge covered the montauk highway in montauk effectively isolating eastern long island for a period of time flooding also affected laguardia airport due to the compact nature of the storm areas west of fire island were largely unaffected by the hurricane there were power outages in new york city but little damage damage was estimated at 5million in the state and one death was reported after thousands of people evacuatedhurricane carol produced hurricane and gale force winds across new england strong winds from hurricane carol destroyed nearly 40% of the apple corn peach and tomato crops from eastern

time there were 65deaths in new england and about 1,000injured people despite the high damage advance warning allowed for many fewer deaths than the total of 488fatalities during the 1938 new england hurricane which affected the same area with similar strength however some areas did not receive advance warning due to power outages preventing people from receiving weather bureau warnings ahead of the stormhurricane carol struck connecticut shortly after high tide and its combination with 10 to 15feet 3 to 4.5m storm surges from new london eastward produced widespread tidal flooding about 2,000people were stranded when a rail line between new haven and rhode island was flooded the heaviest rainfall associated with the passage of the storm occurred in new london where up to 6inches 150mm fell and wind blew off a portion of the city hall roof these strong winds left much of the eastern portion of the state without power near the coast the combination of strong winds and the storm surge damaged or destroyed thousands of buildings including 100destroyed houses many other homes in eastern connecticut were damaged by falling trees thousands had evacuated before the storm reached the area and one person died in the state due to the compact nature of the storm western connecticut experienced little effects from carol overall damage in the state was estimated at 50millionthe

aid was provided after the second hurricanethe high damage caused by hurricane carol and other hurricanes in 1954 prompted the united states government to devote research to set up the national hurricane research project hurricane hunters and the weather bureau collected data on subsequent hurricanes to determine their structure as well as attempted to weaken storms with silver iodide via project stormfurydue to the high damage the name carol was removed from the naming list for 10years the name was reused in the 1965 season but was retroactively retired and it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane carol was the first atlantic hurricane name in history to be retired
