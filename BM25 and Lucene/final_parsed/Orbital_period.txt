orbital period  wikipedia the orbital period is the time a given astronomical object takes to complete one orbit around another object and applies in astronomy usually to planets or asteroids orbiting the sun moons orbiting planets exoplanets orbiting other stars or binary starsfor objects in the solar system this is often referred to as the sidereal period determined by a 360 revolution of one celestial body around another eg the earth orbiting the sun the name sidereal is added as it implies that the object returns to the same position relative to the fixed stars projected in the sky when describing orbits of binary stars the orbital period is usually referred to as just the period for example jupiter has a sidereal period of 11.86 years while the main binary star alpha centauri ab has a period of about 79.91 yearsanother important orbital period definition can refer to the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earths surface an example is the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the sun for example jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from earth thus jupiters opposition occurs once roughly every 13 monthsperiods in astronomy are conveniently expressed in various units of time often in hours days or years they can be also defined under different specific astronomical definitions that are mostly caused by small complex eternal gravitational influences by other celestial objects such variations also include the true placement of the centre of gravity between two astronomical bodies barycenter perturbations by other planets or bodies orbital resonance general relativity etc most are investigated by detailed complex astronomical theories using celestial mechanics using precise positional observations of celestial objects via astrometrythere are many periods related to the orbits of objects each of which are often used in the various fields of astronomy and astrophysics examples of some of the common ones includeaccording to keplers third law the orbital period t in seconds of two bodies orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit iswherefor all ellipses with a given semi-major axis the orbital period is the same regardless of eccentricityinversely for calculating the distance where a body has to orbit in order to pulse a given orbital periodwherefor instance for completing an orbit every 24hours around a mass of 100kg a small body has to orbit at a distance of 1.08meters from its center of masswhen a very small body is in a circular orbit barely above the surface of a sphere of any radius and mean density  in kgm the above equation simplifies to since m v aso for the earth as the central body or any other spherically symmetric body with the same mean density about 5,515kgm we getand for a body made of water 1,000kgmthus as an alternative for using a very small number like g the strength of universal gravity can be described using some reference material like water the orbital period for an orbit just above the surface of a spherical body of water is 3 hours and 18 minutes conversely this can be used as a kind of universal unit of time if we have a unit of mass a unit of length and a unit of densityin celestial mechanics when both orbiting bodies masses have to be taken into account the orbital period t can be calculated as followswherenote that the orbital period is independent of size for a scale model it would be the same when densities are the same see also orbitscaling in gravityin a parabolic or hyperbolic trajectory the motion is not periodic and the duration of the full trajectory is infinitethere are observable characteristics of two bodies which orbit a third body in different orbits and thus have different orbital periods this is known as their synodic period it is the time between conjunctions and since it is observable from either the first or the second body the two synodic periods will be different depending from which celestial body you are observingan example of this related period description is the repeated cycles for celestial bodies as observed from the earths surface the so-called synodic period applying to the elapsed time where planets return to the same kind of phenomena or location for example when any planet returns between its consecutive observed conjunctions with or oppositions to the sun for example jupiter has a synodic period of 398.8 days from earth thus jupiters opposition occurs once roughly every 13 monthsif the orbital periods of the two bodies around the third are called p1 and p2 so that p1p2 their synodic period is given bytable of synodic periods in the solar system relative to earthin the case of a planets moon the synodic period usually means the sun-synodic period namely the time it takes the moon to complete its illumination phases completing the solar phases for an astronomer on the planets surface the earths motion does not determine this value for other planets because an earth observer is not orbited by the moons in question for example deimoss synodic period is 1.2648days 0.18% longer than deimoss sidereal period of 1.2624d
