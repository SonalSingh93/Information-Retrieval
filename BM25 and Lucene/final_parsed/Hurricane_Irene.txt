hurricane irene  wikipedia hurricane irene was a large and destructive tropical cyclone which affected much of the caribbean and east coast of the united states during late august 2011 irene is ranked as the ninth-costliest hurricane in united states history the ninth named storm first hurricane and first major hurricane of the 2011 atlantic hurricane season irene originated from a well-defined atlantic tropical wave that began showing signs of organization east of the lesser antilles due to development of atmospheric convection and a closed center of circulation the system was designated as tropical storm irene on august20 2011 after intensifying irene made landfall in st croix as a strong tropical storm later that day early on august21 the storm made a second landfall in puerto rico while crossing the island irene strengthened into a category 1 hurricane the storm paralleled offshore of hispaniola continuing to slowly intensify in the process shortly before making four landfalls in the bahamas irene peaked as a 120mph 190kmh category3 hurricanethereafter the storm slowly leveled off in intensity as it struck the bahamas and then curved northward after passing east of grand bahama continuing to weaken irene was downgraded to a category1 hurricane before making landfall on the outer banks of north carolina on august27 becoming the first hurricane to make landfall in the united states since hurricane ike in 2008 early on the following day the storm re-emerged into the atlantic from southeastern virginia although irene remained a hurricane over water it weakened to a tropical storm while making yet another landfall in the little egg inlet in southeastern new jersey on august27 a few hours later irene made its ninth and final landfall in brooklyn new york city early on august29 irene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone hitting vermont after remaining inland as a tropical cyclone for less than 12hoursthroughout its path irene caused widespread destruction and at least 56 deaths damage estimates throughout the united states are estimated near 15.6 billion which made it the ninth-costliest hurricane in united states history only behind hurricane andrew of 1992 hurricane ivan of 2004 hurricanes wilma and katrina of 2005 hurricane ike of 2008 hurricane sandy in 2012 and hurricanes harvey irma and maria in 2017 in addition monetary losses in the caribbean and canada were 830million and 130million respectively for a total of nearly 16.6 billion in damageon august 15 2011 a tropical wave exited the west african coast and emerged into the atlantic characterized by distinct low-level cyclonic rotation and deep tropical humidity it remained well-defined while moving steadily westward for several days to the south of the cape verde islands although at the time any notable convection occurred well to the southwest of its axis as the wave distanced itself from the islands development of thunderstorms and showers in its proximity continued to remain scarce and it became rather broad in appearance on august 19 the convective structure began to show signs of organization as the associated atmospheric pressure lowered and with a progressively favorable environment situated ahead of the wave its chances of undergoing tropical cyclogenesis markedly increased the strong thunderstorm activity continued to become more pronounced around the main low-pressure feature by august 20 the national hurricane center noted that tropical cyclone formation was imminent as the wave neared the lesser antilles and a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a small surface circulation center just southwest of a burst of vigorous convection and unusually high sustained winds indicating sufficient organization for the cyclone to be upgraded into tropical storm irene at 23:00 utc that dayirene was positioned about 190mi 310km east of dominica in the lesser antilles when it was classified and named along weakening high pressure over the west-central atlantic inducing a roughly west-northwestward path for most of its journey through the eastern caribbean its mid-level circulation continued to become better established as hints of pronounced banding features curved north of the surface center on august 21 the surface center reformed closer to the deepest convection furthermore an anticyclone aloft provided supportive outflow over the cyclone with the improved structure as well as light wind shear and high sea surface temperatures irene was forecast to strengthen to near hurricane force prior to landfall in hispaniola over the subsequent day august 22 while passing near the island of saint croix in the us virgin islands irene traced toward puerto rico more northward than initially expected where it underwent a considerable increase in strength and organization hours later irene moved ashore approaching from the southeast at landfall near punta santiago humacao puerto rico with estimated sustained winds of 70mph 110kmh despite the storms interaction with land radar imagery showed a ragged eye-like feature and doppler weather radar data indicated wind speeds in excess of hurricane force just after its initial landfall irene was accordingly upgraded to a category 1 hurricane the first of the 2011 atlantic hurricane seasonwith the hurricane then situated just north of the mountainous coast of hispaniola the storm deepened little after reemerging over water and any additional organization during the rest of the day was gradual after briefly weakening on august 23 however irene began to develop a distinct eye encircled by an area of deepening convection the next morning moving erratically through the southeast bahamas over very warm waters irene quickly expanded as its outflow aloft became very well established the cyclone intensified into a category 3 major hurricane as it recurved toward the northwest along a weakness in the subtropical ridge the cyclone subsequently underwent a partial eyewall replacement cycle which resulted in some reduction in its winds although a distinct eye redeveloped for a few hours it obscured once again soon thereafter irene was unable to recover from the cycle with no further significant intensification expected thereafterearly on august 27 irene further weakened to a category 1 hurricane as it approached the outer banks of north carolina at 7:30am edt 11:30 utc the same day irene made landfall near cape lookout on north carolinas outer banks with winds of 85mph 137kmh but exhibited an unusually low pressure of 951 mbar which is typically found in a category 3 hurricane after having tracked over land for about 10 hours the eye of irene became cloud-filled although the center remained well-defined on radar images early in the evening of august 27 irene re-emerged into the atlantic near the southern end of the chesapeake bay in virginia as a marginal category 1 hurricane slowly weakening as it continued northward and weakening to a tropical storm early on august 28 shortly before sunrise at 5:35am edt 0935 utc on august 28 irene made a second landfall at brigantine in southeastern new jersey with winds of 70mph 110kmh and soon after moved over water again hugging the new jersey coastline about 3 1/2 hours later tropical storm irene made landfall with 65mph 105kmh winds in the coney island neighborhood of brooklyn new yorkfollowing its final new york landfall irene moved northeast over new england while maintaining its strength before it was declared an extratropical cyclone early on august 29 while its center was located near the new hampshirevermont border during that day the system continued to move towards the northeast before it was absorbed by a frontal system early on august 30in response to the formation of irene tropical storm warnings were issued for all of the leeward islands and puerto rico also in the lesser antilles the storms approach prompted authorities in the us virgin islands to close off air- and seaports as well as to open public shelters as irene was forecast to make landfall on hispaniola a tropical storm watch was initially issued for the south coast of the dominican republic though it was upgraded to a hurricane warning on august 21 after strengthening was forecast in light of the expected intensification to hurricane status a tropical storm warning was also issued for the northern coast fire of that country while a tropical storm watch was put in effect for all of haiti the tropical storm warning for puerto rico was simultaneously upgraded to a hurricane watch later that day all of the dominican republic was placed under a hurricane warning with the tropical storm watch for haiti upgraded to a warning and a tropical storm watch initiated for the southeastern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands as irenes forecast track became justified the latter watch was upgraded to a warning on august 22 while a hurricane watch was declared for the central bahamaswith irenes projected path fixed over much of the united states east coast over 65 million people from the carolinas to northern

canada numerous large local and ocean-going vessels anchored in bedford basin to ride out the stormfollowing its path through the northeastern caribbean irene spread tropical storm conditions across all of the leeward islands causing overall little damage but flooded some low-lying areas to the south strong thunderstorms and showers spread over martinique though most of the activity occurred prior to development into a tropical cyclone in spite of the center tracking just north of guadeloupes island grande-terre the strongest effects were brought on by irenes outer rainbands tropical-storm-force winds generated brief rough seas with peak wave heights of no more than 18ft 5.5m accompanying intermittent torrents swept through much of the territory but overall rainfall was moderate precipitation totals of between 3.1 and 4.7in 79 and 119mm fell in basse-terre during the event due to the storm conditions liat was forced to suspend all of its flights in antigua for early august 22passing near the british virgin islands while strengthening irene brought gusty winds and heavy precipitation to the territory however resultant property damage was minimal a lightning strike over necker island sparked a large fire at one of business magnate richard bransons resort homes but all of its guest occupantsincluding british actress kate winsletwere able to exit the area irene crossed saint croix us virgin islands as a strong tropical storm on august 21 though relatively calm winds associated with the passage of its center were recorded over the island to the north in saint thomas storm conditions became progressively worse sustained gale-force winds swept across the territory with a gust of up to 68mph 109kmh recorded at 21:20 utc upon impact the winds and inclement weather caused scattered power outages across all islands wide-scale assessments confirmed light damage to public schools mostly confined to debris and leaksacross puerto rico heavy rains caused

about 121,000 customers were cut off from potable water service at the height of the storm and islandwide at least 771 people had to take shelter at higher elevations winds estimated by radar neared 111mph 179kmh the highest amounts of precipitation fell across eastern parts of the territory in gurabo a peak total of 22.04in 560mm was recorded several rivers burst their banks as a consequence of the rains causing additional flooding the agricultural sector also suffered losses from the storm particularly near the location of landfall high winds uprooted crop plants and several coffee and banana plantations sustained minor damage of the plantations the most affected were situated in yabucoa and maunabo where severe flooding washed out copious amounts of banana crop the rains continued to fall for hours into the wake of the storm prompting the issuance of flood watches in total irene affected over 1,500 people in puerto rico and one driver was killed after their vehicle was caught in swollen currents preliminary estimates indicate structural damage could be as high as 500 million usd with additional losses due to the three-day labor suspensions pinned at over 60.4 million usdoffshore near culebra island a sailboat was reported sunken due to rough seas prior to landfall in mainland puerto rico gale-force winds felled fences and shattered windows with a flying object piercing through one residence a total of 46locals sought refuge to ride out the storm but one family required post-storm shelter after the roof to their home was lost on the island of vieques similar sustained winds of 51mph 82kmh were recorded as well as some gusts of up to 71mph 114kmh some power and telephone service cutoffs were reported and the islands airport halted its operationsskirting barely north past hispaniola the large storm produced gales and prolonged precipitation in the dominican republic displacing over 37,700 people and leaving at least 88 communities isolated in its wake accompanying storm surge affected roughly 200 homes and prompted evacuations along the northern coastlines the strongest winds also occurred in northern cibao where they felled multiple trees and toppled utility poles swollen rivers creeks and streams caused widespread residential flooding and damage to roads saturated soil in the region triggered mudslides causing additional disruptions despite its distance irene produced extreme rainfall in southern parts of the country that led to many secondary effects resultant floods combined with two overflown rivers swept through much of san cristbal causing one bridge to collapse under the rushing waters the flooding produced at least two drown victims in that area both later confirmed dead elsewhere another fatality occurred in cambita garabitos and six others were listed as missing heavy rains also fell across la altagracia province where one person in higey went missing and hundreds were evacuated most of the damage in the region occurred due to flooded rivers with some agricultural losses reported the excess surface waters overwhelmed and damaged some 170 inlets in all irene affected at least 2,292 households according to preliminary reports with 16 houses rendered beyond repair the associated monetary losses surmounted rd1 billion us30 million in the wake of the eventin northeastern haiti the prolonged precipitation overflowed rivers and produced surface floods and damaging landslides across multiple road sections about 500 residents in risk zones evacuated while some sought shelter but only one of more than 160 evacuation sites required usage rough surge produced high coastal flooding with some reports of thousands of damaged homes in the vicinity of port-au-prince brisk winds blew down many refuge tents home to victims from the major january 12 2010 earthquake overall officials indicated impact was less severe than initially feared the storm only left isolated flood damage in its wake particularly throughout northern parts of the country however two people lost their lives after being caught in swollen rivers and four others suffered injuriesas irene was tracking through the bahamas the outerbands of the storm dropped light rainfall in eastern cuba the cities of moa and sagua de tnamo in holgun province reported 2.36in 60mm of rain however the average rainfall throughout the holgun province did not exceed 0.20in 5.1mm some damage occurred throughout guantnamo province where rough surf and rains caused flooding in baracoa in addition waves of 10 to 12 feet 3.0 to 3.7m high were seen in gibara holgun on wednesday 24 when irenes eye was located between acklins and crooked islands bahamas just 178 miles 286km northeast of the city the strong waves combined with high tide caused a slight coastal floodingturks and caicos on august 24 irene passed over the british overseas territory of turks and caicos islands at category 1 strength the hurricane produced high winds that blew off roofs and downed power lines throughout the territory in cockburn town residences reported loss of power and light poles were toppled many homes on grand turk island also reported a loss of electricity during irenes passage although structural damage in the area was limited the strongest of the rains and gusts occurred in providenciales where light wind damage was reported to roofs and resorts the grand turk cruise port also sustained some minor damage from the storm but operations resumed three days after impactbahamas a major hurricane irene trekked right through the bahamas with its eye making landfall on several of the islands a peak wind gust of about 140mph 230kmh was recorded at the height of the storm and localized heavy rains of up to 13 inches 330mm fell in the area the extreme winds damaged at least 40 homes on mayaguana island and dozens of homes on acklins were completely obliterated on the latter island the hurricane reportedly wiped out 90 percent of the lovely bay settlement similar winds tore off the roof and shattered the windows out of a high school on crooked island where wind gusts as high as 99mph 159kmh were reported as well a local church on the island partially collapsed due to the storm the worst of the destruction occurred in cat island characterized by widespread shattered glass and torn houses in all the storm caused millions of dollars worth in structural damage on the island and left many homeless across new providence and grand bahama only limited impact occurred as irene remained well offshore businesses operations were scheduled to return to normal shortly after the storm nationwide the damage was estimated at 40million despite the overall extensive structural damage inflicted there were no reports of fatalities on the islands in the wake of disastergales from irene affected nearly all of the eastern seaboard extending from florida to new england and as far inland as central new york and central pennsylvania affecting all or large parts of 15 states and the district of columbia the winds combined with soil saturation due to the extreme amounts of precipitation in many of the impacted areas both from irene and from previous thunderstorms uprooted countless trees and power lines along the storms path roughly 7.4 million homes and businesses lost electrical power with approximately 3.3 million still without power as of august 30 three days after landfall coastal areas suffered extensive flood damage followings its potent storm surge with additional freshwater flooding reported in many areas the storm spawned scattered tornadoes causing significant property damage as evidenced by destroyed homes in the northeastern region more than ten rivers measured record flood heights at their hydrographs rivers in at least six northeastern states reached hundred-year flood levels while the flooding in greene county new york was described as five-hundred-year-flood conditions flooding in schoharie county new york was also reported by the national weather service in albany new york as five-hundred-year-flood conditions throughout its path in the contiguous united states irene caused approximately 15.6 billion 2011 usd in damage and 47 deathsthough irene spared florida from a direct hit its outernmost rainbands produced squalls and intermittent torrents along the states eastern coastlines brisk winds produced scattered power outages and waves reaching as high as 12ft 3.7m rough surf in the boynton inlet injured at least eight people and two surfers were killed offshore volusia county elsewhere in lantana large waves sweeping over seawalls went on to destroy a lifeguard tower localized beach erosion was also reported although it was not significant onshore comparatively light winds brushed the state the lake worth pier reporting a peak gust of 40mph 64kmh with the palm beach international airport recording winds of no more than 31mph 50kmh precipitation in the area was also light with a peak accumulation of 2.67 inches 68mm recorded at fort lauderdale executive airport further north rainfall from the storm totaled no more than 1.31 inches 33mm on august 24 in melbourneowing to its unusually large windfield irene affected long stretches of south carolina coastlines with gusts and sporadic heavy showers even though it remained offshore gale-force winds picked up through the lowcountry during the afternoon of august 26 with a gust of 55mph 89kmh measured at a coastal marine observing site on folly island scattered power outages left over 4,000 residences in the dark mostly due to toppled utility poles the winds also felled trees and generated rough surf along charleston county coastlines and minor beach erosion was noted elsewhere in that county a downed tree trapped several people in their vehicle but they were all rescuedtropical-storm-force winds began to affect the outer banks hours before landfall producing waves of 69ft 1.82.7m in addition to the gales irene spawned several tornadoes early on august 27 while approaching the coast no regular weather station or buoy however measured sustained hurricane-force winds from the storm with the highest winds officially recorded at 67mph 108kmh by a buoy near cape lookout precipitation totals from irene in the region were particularly high ranging between 1014 inches 250360mm bunyan recorded a peak amount of approximately 14 inches 360mmthe large hurricane left extensive damage in its wake and produced tornadoes that damaged homes and overturned vehicles following the touch down of a potent tornado at least four homes were demolished in columbia while up to three others sustained significant damage the hurricane caused multiple flooded areas and uprooted trees along coastlines in nash county a snatched tree limb struck and killed one person prior to the storm a resident in onslow county suffered a fatal heart attack while applying plywood to his house two people in pitt and sampson counties were additionally killed by falling trees as were two others in goldsboro and pitt county in traffic accidents a man also drowned in the flooded cape fear river in all over 1,100 homes were destroyed the estimated 71 million in damage did not include agricultural losseshurricane irene cut several breaches across north carolina highway 12 on hatteras island isolating the island from the rest of the outer banks several of the smaller breaches were filled in with sand but the largest which is 200 feet 61m wide was left open recreating pea island for the first time since 1945 as a result the only way to access hatteras island was by ferry on october 10 2011 a temporary 662-foot-long 202m bridge opened over the breach the bridge could be in place for more than 10 years while other solutions are consideredthe path of the hurricane was thought by many to be the worst-case scenario for the outer banks just east over the pamlico sound the storm winds pushed the water rushing into the sound in the form of rainfall back up the rivers feeding the sound and when the hurricane passed the water rushed back out causing historic flooding along the outer banks in particular in the towns of waves rodanthe and salvo the flood caused major damage to the area that can still be seen in mirlo beach at the north end of rodanthe flood waters exceeded seven feet in many locations and destroyed many houses and businessesradar image of the storm at landfall in the outer banks of north carolinairene over north carolina on august 27the

hoboken the north tube of the holland tunnel was briefly closed flooding affected the train lines in the trenton area the storm killed seven people in the state and damage was estimated at around 1billionin addition to major flooding the combination of already heavily saturated ground from a wet summer and heavy wind gusts made new jersey especially vulnerable to wind damage notably in union county fallen trees blocked vital roads including portions of new jersey route 28 and us route 22 numerous homes suffered structural damages from the wind in total approximately 1.46 million customers
