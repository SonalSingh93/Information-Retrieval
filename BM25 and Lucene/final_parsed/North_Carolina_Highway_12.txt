hurricane isabel which opened a new inlet 3,000 feet 910m wide and 30 feet 9.1m deep through the community of hatteras village on the southern end of hatteras island this new inlet was temporarily named the isabel inlet after the hurricane road access along nc12 was temporarily severed until the island was repaired and restored by sand pumped ashore by the army corps of engineers in 2007 subtropical storm andrea caused high winds to push waves over dunes and onto the highway on hatteras island leaving water a foot deep and sand 2 to 3 feet 0.91m deep in some placesnc 12 was severed in two places by hurricane irene in late august 2011 the road was breached by two small inlets about 200 feet 61m across apiece in the pea island national wildlife refuge and north of rodanthe as a result the only way to access hatteras island was by ferry on october 10 2011 a temporary bridge opened over the largest breach the bridge which is 662 feet 202m long could be in place for more than 10 years while other solutions are thought out as hurricane sandy battered the east coast in october 2012 it has left portions of nc 12 inundated with salt water and sand that forced the closure of the road leaving the remaining people on the outer banks isolated from mainland north carolinain late october 2012 hurricane sandy washed out and damaged a portion of the road at the s-curves north of rodanthe on the pea island national wildlife refuge emergency ferry service was established from rodanthe to stumpy point ferry terminals as in 2011 the ferry service became the lifeline for hatteras island noreasters and storms repeatedly caused breaches since the road was repaired in december 2012 a state of emergency was declared and 20.8 million of emergency federal funding was secured to construct a more permanent repair
