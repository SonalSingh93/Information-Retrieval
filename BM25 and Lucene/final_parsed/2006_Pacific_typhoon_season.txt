2006 pacific typhoon season  wikipedia the 2006 pacific typhoon season was a near-average season that produced a total of 23 named storms 15 typhoons and six super typhoons the season ran throughout 2006 though most tropical cyclones typically develop between may and october the seasons first named storm chanchu developed on may 9 while the seasons last named storm trami dissipated on december 20 this season was also much active costly and deadly than the previous seasonthroughout the season many typhoons made landfall at a higher intensity typhoon saomai was the most powerful typhoon to strike china for over 50 years as a category 4 typhoon responsible for over 400 deaths typhoon shanshan struck japan and became the costliest typhoon this season with a total damage of about 2.5 billion the philippines got hit by a total of six typhoons which saw the highest number since 1974 all six typhoons were responsible for over 1,000 casualties and several millions of damages typhoon ioke which formed from the central pacific entered the basin and became the strongest central pacific hurricane moreover it was stated that the ratio of intense typhoons was 0.73 which was the highest since 1970the scope of this article is limited to the pacific ocean to the north of the equator between 100e and 180th meridian within the northwestern pacific ocean there are two separate agencies that assign names to tropical cyclones which can often result in a cyclone having two names the japan meteorological agencyjma will name a tropical cyclone should it be judged to have 10-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 65kmh 40mph anywhere in the basin whilst the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administrationpagasa assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135e and 115e and between 5n25n regardless of whether or not a tropical cyclone has already been given a name by the jma tropical depressions that are monitored by the united states joint typhoon warning centerjtwc are given a number with a w suffixduring the year several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many tropical cyclones tropical storms and typhoons will form during a season andor how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country these agencies included the tropical storm risktsr consortium of university college london pagasa and taiwans central weather bureau some of the forecasts took into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the la nia conditions that were observed during the previous yearon march 7 tropical storm risk issued its first forecast for the season at an extended-range forecasting a close to average season of 27 tropical storms 17 typhoons and 8 intense typhoons the ace predicted was around 298 by may 5 tropical storm risk issued their second forecast for the season raising their numbers to 29 tropical storms 19 typhoons and 9 intense typhoons with an ace of 326 this is due to the observed warming of sea-surface temperatures in the nio 3.75 region and current patterns within the central pacific indicating slightly higher activity tsr released its third forecast for the season on june 7 predicting the same numbers with the same reason though on their fourth forecast during july 5 tsr stated that the 2006 season will be 15% above the 19652005 norm therefore they raised the number of intense typhoons to 10 and their ace to 349 the other reason behind this is due to the fact that there was an increase in tropical activity and much warmer ssts over in the nio 3.75 region than the previous forecast on august 4 tsr released their final forecast they reduced the number of intense typhoons to 9 and the ace to 325 this was because it was reported that a slight decrease in tropical activity from the previous forecast and is due solely of a slight decrease in ssts over in the same regionthe pacific typhoon season runs throughout 2006 and has no official bounds though most tropical cyclones from this basin generally develops from the months from may through to october despite the season turned out to be active most tropical cyclones developed during the second half of the year with only one typhoon chanchu developing during the month of may some minor systems also developed before may with the first tropical system of the year agaton developing to the east of philippines on january 20 bringing minor damages as it crossed the country few days latertropical cyclogenesis had become much favorable during late june with formations of jelawat and ewiniar it was also during the same time when noaa had stated that the weak 200607 el nio had started from mid july to early august three back-to-back storms made landfall over in china which were bilis kaemi and prapiroon with all three combined more than 900 people have been dead and damages were reported more than us5 billion shortly thereafter environments throughout most of the basin became favorable with less shear more convection and warmer water as three simultaneous storms maria saomai and bopha formed and affected three different landmasses such as japan china and taiwan respectively later in the same month hurricane ioke had entered the basin from the central pacific as the strongest central pacific storm in recorder history as a category 5 powerful stormon september an unnamed and unclassified tropical storm have been discovered by meteorologist gary padgett and dr karl hoarau later typhoon xangsane affected luzon philippines causing major damages with more than 200 people dead the country saw four storms making landfall with three of them reaching category 4 or 5 super typhoon status typhoon cimaron made landfall over in northern luzon as a category 5 super typhoon with minimal damages by november typhoon chebi made landfall in the same area as cimaron though effects from the typhoon were much smaller than cimaron although by late november typhoon durian made landfall in bicol region combined effects with ash from the mayon volcano had killed over 1,500 people and damgaes at least us530 million durian also crossed the basin and into the north indian ocean basin the first time since 2003 during early december two systems formed typhoon utor crossed visayas with minimal damage and tropical storm trami a very weak system that didnt affect any landmasses became the final tropical cyclone and dissipated on december 20on january 20 the jma began monitoring a minor tropical depression located about 555km 345mi east of mindanao in the southern philippines as it traveled in an erratic northwestward direction it slowly became better organized on january 23 the jma assessed the storm to have attained winds of 55kmh 35mph 10-minute winds around the same time pagasa began issuing advisories on the system and gave it the local name agaton the depression weakened as it crossed over northern samar island and southern luzon traveling towards the west the system failed to strengthen and dissipated on january 27 while located over the south china sea about halfway between vietnam and borneoon march 4 a tropical depression formed out of a wave close to the equator southeast of palau the jtwc upgraded it to tropical storm 01w at 3pm utc the same day the jtwc downgraded it back to a depression on march 5 due to shear and it never regained tropical storm strength before dissipating on march 7on may 8 the jma started to track a tropical depression about 175km 110mi northeast of palau and later the jtwc followed suit giving the designation of 02w by the next day 02w had intensified into a tropical storm with the jma naming it chanchu the pagasa had also declared that chanchu had entered their area giving the local name caloy chanchu reached typhoon intensity and made its first landfall over in samar on may 11 and several hours later it struck mindoro at category 2 typhoon intensity as chanchu emerged to the south china sea and moved northward the storm explosively intensified into a category 4 typhoon and reached peak intensity with 10-minute sustained winds of 175kmh 110mph on may 15 by may 17 chanchu rapidly weakened into a severe tropical storm as it made its landfall over in shantou guandong both the jma and the jtwc issued its final advisory on may 18 as it became extratropicalin the philippines the storm caused 41 deaths and a total of 117.6 million us2.15 million in damage despite chanchu didnt made landfall over in vietnam several ships sunk and lost a total of 18 people who are fishermen were dead chanchu is also the most intense typhoon on hong kong observatorys record to enter the south china sea in may chanchu necessitated the strong wind signal no 3 in both hong kong and macau in hong kong the gale force signal 8 should have been hoisted for at least 10 hours as sustained gales were affecting the eastern part of the territory where the hourly mean wind reached 83kmh with gust reaching over 100kmh in some areas overall damage in china was at 7 billion us872 millionon june 24 the jma started to track a weak tropical depression located to the southeast of samar visayas after crossing the archipelago as it emerged to the south china sea on june 26 the pagasa named it domeng while the jtwc had started issuing advisories with the designation of 03w moving northwestward 03w had entered in an area of favorable environments and intensified into a tropical storm with the naming of jelawat on june 27 jelawat made landfall over southern china and fully dissipated inland on june 29the storm dropped heavy rainfall across southern china and haikou recorded a rainfall of 309.7mm 12inches during the storm passage a total of 8.6inches 220mm rain fell in 16 hours in kampung bundu malaysia the rainfall killed seven people and left one missing the flooding from jelawat ruined 200 square kilometres of farmland and destroyed 190 houseson june 29 a persistent tropical disturbance was classified as a tropical depression by the jtwc while east of palau the depression moved northwestward and was upgraded to tropical storm 04w by the jtwc on june 30 the jma designated the storm tropical storm ewiniar at around the same time the name ewiniar was submitted by the federated states of micronesia and refers to a traditional storm god of chuukewiniar was responsible for at least 30 deaths in china which it brushed as a typhoon the typhoon gradually weakened as it moved over colder waters and made landfall in south korea on july 10 as a severe tropical storm as ewiniar moved across the country it passed within 30 miles 48km of seoul the storm brought heavy rain that triggered floods and mudslides in the southern part of the country killing at least six people ewiniar became extratropical over the sea of japan on the same daya tropical disturbance northeast of yap developed sufficient convection to be designated a tropical depression on july 8 the depression strengthened into a tropical storm the next day and was designated tropical storm bilis by the jma the word bilis submitted by the philippines means speed or swiftness pagasa operationally treated this storm as a typhoon for a short time on july 13 but it officially remained a tropical storm as it moved west-northwestward toward taiwan after moving over northern taiwan bilis made landfall in fujian china at 12:50pm cst on july 14 weakening into a tropical depression inland the next day jma carried the system as a tropical depression until july 17 bilis brought very heavy rain widespread flooding landslides and strong winds to the philippines taiwan and areas of mainland china causing 672 deaths and 4.4billion 2006 us in damagea tropical depression formed on july 18 near the caroline islands it quickly strengthened to tropical storm strength the same day on july 19 the storm was named kaemi by the jma the correct name gaemi was submitted by south korea and is a korean word for ant it strengthened into a severe tropical storm on july 20 and further deepened into a typhoon 24 hours later kaemi made landfall in jinjiang fujian at 3:50pm cst on july 25 as a minimal typhoonheavy rainfall in taiwan caused flooding and four minor injuries rain also fell heavily in the northern philippines the storm has also killed at least 32people in china while another 60people are missing agricultural losses in taiwan amounted to nt73million us2.2million total damages from the storm amounted to 450millionpagasa named a system east of the philippines as tropical depression henry later on the same day that the jma recognised it as a tropical depression on july 27 the jtwc upgraded this system to a tropical storm on the morning of august 1 hong kong observatory also did so and issued the tropical cyclone signal no 1 that same afternoon and shortly after the jma upgraded the system to tropical storm prapiroon the name prapiroon was submitted by thailand and is the name of a thai rain deity the jma upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm on the morning of august 2 pagasa ceased advisories on the storm shortly after as it moved out of its area of responsibility the jtwc and the hko upgraded prapiroon to a typhoon at 3am utc while the jma officially upgraded it to a typhoon at 12pm utc 8pm hkt prapiroon necessitated the first tropical cyclone signal no 8 in macau this year in hong kong the flag raising ceremony at the golden bauhinia square was cancelled due to strong wind prapiroon made landfall at 7:20pm cst on august 3the strong winds due to the storm resulted in 70% of flights being cancelled delayed or diverted in the hong kong international airport the highest since the opening in 1999 however the airport remained open throughout the storm passage and many flights successfully landed or took off on august 3 inbound flights were rerouted to nearby airports and outbound flights were cancelled or postponed on landfall in guangdong province china it forced the evacuation of some 660,000people and caused an estimated 5.4billion chinese yuan worth of damage 77people were reported killed it also affected hunan guangxi and hainan prapiroon degenerated into an area of low pressure on august 6maria formed out of a tropical depression over the open waters of the western pacific ocean on august5 the jma classified the depression as a tropical storm while the jtwc kept it as a depression the storm quickly strengthened into a typhoon the next day reaching its peak intensity with winds of 130kmh 80mph early on august6 the storm gradually weakened as it began to recurve causing it to parallel the southeastern coast of japan on august9 maria weakened into a tropical depression and later into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating on august15 maria had only minor effects in japan mainly heavy rains which were estimated to have peaked over 400mm 15.7in on the izu peninsula one person was killed after being struck by lightning and six others were injuredthe jtwc identified a tropical depression near the caroline islands late on august 4 utc the jma designated it as such at 12am utc august 5 nine hours later the jtwc upgraded tropical depression 08w to a tropical storm three hours before the jma named it saomai the name is from the vietnamese sao mai meaning morning star a reference to the planet venusthe jtwc designated it a typhoon at 3pm utc august 6 the jma upgraded saomai to a severe tropical storm at 6pm utc and as it continued to strengthen it was upgraded to a typhoon just 12 hours later saomai passed into the area of responsibility of pagasa on august 8 and was named typhoon juan by pagasa on august 8 the storm underwent explosive development and by august 9 it had become a category5-equivalent super typhoonsaomai made landfall in zhejiang china on august 10 with maximum sustained winds of 115 knots 1-minute mean stronger than chanchu earlier this season saomai was responsible for at least 458 deaths mostly in china and 2.5billion 2006usd in damagethe jma identified a tropical depression in the open pacific on august 5 pagasa named this storm late on august 5 as it was forecast to enhance the southwest monsoon and bring rains to the philippines around 1800utc the jtwc declared that the system had developed into a tropical depression and gave it the number 10w jma upgraded it to tropical storm bopha on august 6 the name bopha was submitted by cambodia and is a flower and girls name around this time the jtwc also upgraded the system to a tropical stormthe jtwc recognised its existence as a tropical depression at 9am utc the same day before upgrading it to a tropical storm at 3pm utc the jma then upgraded it to a severe tropical storm as it slowly churned westwards at 12am utc august 7 before downgrading it 18 hours later bopha unexpectedly restrengthened into a severe tropical storm at 3am utc august 8 before weakening back to a tropical storm at 12pm utcbopha later made landfall on taiwan at about 2am local time on august 9 at this time the jtwc reported that bopha attained winds of 100kmh 65mph tropical storm bopha then weakened into a tropical depression before degenerating into a remnant low on august 10the outer bands of tropical storm bopha produced heavy rains over northern luzon triggering flooding that destroyed 1,200 homes and killed seven people two of the fatalities occurred after a home was destroyed by a landslide in kalinga province the landslide damaged 20 other homes a church and a schoolas severe tropical storm bopha approached the island on august 8 the meteorological agency in taiwan issued land and sea warnings for most of the region residents were warned about the possibility of torrential rains flooding and mudslides although the storm was forecast to directly impact the island all businesses remained open and schools were not closed in hong kong the hong kong observatory issued standby signal number one as bopha came within 800km 500mi of the city on august 9 this signal was later discontinued on august 11between august 9 and 10 the remnants of bopha produced moderate rainfall around hong kong peaking at 45.6mm 1.80in wind gusts up to 110kmh 70mph were also produced by the storm throughout the city a storm surge of 0.48m 1.6ft was recorded in tai po kau on august 8tropical depression 11w formed south of iwo jima on august 12 early on august 13 as it moved to the north-northwest the jtwc upgraded it to a tropical storm the jma named it wukong later that day wukong was submitted by peoples republic of china and it is the name of a character in a chinese epic wukong absorbed tropical storm sonamu shortly before landfall in japan wukong then stalled over kysh before starting to jog to the north-northwest it was downgraded to a tropical depression on august 20in post-operational analysis by the jma wukong was upgraded to a severe tropical stormon august 13 a tropical depression formed south of naha okinawa and was named katring by pagasa and sonamu by jma the name sonamu was submitted by dpr korea and signifies a pine tree sonamu began interacting with nearby tropical storm wukong on august 15 with the outflow from the stronger wukong producing unfavourable shear over the cyclone the jma declared the system a tropical depression and stopped issuing advisories on august 16 the jtwc followed shortly afterin the afternoon of august 23 the china meteorological administration declared the formation of a tropical depression near hainan hong kong observatory followed later that afternoon the depression necessitated tropical cyclone signal no1 in hong kong and macau which means that the centre of a tropical cyclone is within 800km 500mi of the respective special administrative regions and may later affect them the depression made landfall at guangdong at 5:55am cst on august 25 and dissipated later that morningthe jtwc designated the system as a tropical depression at 9pm utc august 24 but only issued two warnings on the systemon august 27 hurricane ioke which had formed in the central pacific crossed the international date line and entered the japan meteorological agencys area of responsibility at around 6am utc keeping its name while being reclassified as typhoon ioke ioke had earlier affected johnston atoll on august 31 the center of the typhoon passed very close to wake island 200people were evacuated from there in advance of its approach typhoon ioke then passed just to the northeast of minami torishima which had been evacuated ahead of the storm but as a weakened category3-equivalent typhoon ioke then turned to the northeast weakening as it started undergoing extratropical transition the jma released its final advisory on september 7 the extratropical remnants of ioke moved into the bering sea where it caused severe beach erosion along the western alaskan coastlinein early september a tropical disturbance developed near wake island and gradually developed though never officially warned upon by any agency meteorologist gary padgett and dr karl hoarau of cergy-pontoise university surmised that the system likely was a tropical cyclone dr hoarau estimated that the system became a tropical depression early on september5 and tracked north-northeast attaining tropical storm intensity 18hours later around that time the system featured a well-defined low-level circulation significant convection wrapping around the circulation and excellent outflow additionally a quikscat pass revealed estimated surface winds of 95kmh 60mph around the time dr haorau classified it a tropical storm the jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert and their satellite intensity estimates reached t2.5 indicating a minimal tropical storm on september6 the system began to weaken as it turned north-northwest convection became intermittent flaring around the circulation and dr haorau estimated it weakened to a depression later that day continuing northward the system moved into a region of cooler waters and higher wind shear inhibiting redevelopment by september9 the system became more extratropical in nature and was last noted by the jtwc at that timehong kong observatory identified a tropical depression about 460kilometres north of yap on september 9 the same day the jma recognised it the jtwc declared the formation of tropical depression 14w the next day on the afternoon of september 10 it entered the pagasa aor and was named luis later at 12pm utc on the same day the jma upgraded the tropical depression to tropical storm shanshan the name shanshan was contributed by hong kong and is a girls name shanshan quickly strengthened and was upgraded into a severe tropical storm on september 11 and a typhoon later that day shanshan weakened slightly on september 14 but quickly restrengthened and reached category4 status on the jtwcs scale shanshan passed through the yaeyama islands in the early morning hours of september 16 the jtwc reported that shanshan was becoming extratropical early on september 17 as the typhoon weakened to a tropical storm the jtwc issued its final advisory on shanshan later that day and the jma issued its last advisory on september 18 after shanshan completed extratropical transitionas shanshan neared taiwan the central weather bureau and local officials warned of flooding and high winds however as shanshan turned towards japan all warnings were cancelled south korean forecasters also issued warnings ahead of an expected landfall but this did not materialise ships were diverted as ports were closed as a precaution while some other boats were forced to remain docked in japan more than 90,000people were evacuated from yamaguchi prefectureover 200people were injured by shanshan and 11people were killed mostly in kysh although two deaths were reported in south korea a tornado spawned by the typhoon caused a train derailment in nobeoka miyazaki japan which caused no fatalities peak gusts on iriomote reached 155mph 248kmh flights and trains were delayed while electricity was cut to about 3000 homes in korea a ship also sank off ulleungdohong kong observatory identified a tropical depression about 360kilometres east-northeast of xisha on september 12 and issued standby signal no1 accordingly the tropical depression also necessitated the issuance of the standby signal no 1 in macau at 2pm utc on the same day the jtwc designated it as a tropical depression 15w at 9pm utc september 12 the jma had earlier already identified it as a tropical depression as it strengthened and edged closer to the coastal areas of guangdong the strong wind signal no 3 was issued both in hong kong and macau on september 13 it made landfall in western guangdong around 11:30pm cst that night and dissipated inlandthe joint typhoon warning center identified an area of disturbed weather northeast of chuuk on september 13 the disturbance drifted to the north over the next few days gradually increasing in organization the jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the disturbance on september 16 and both the jtwc and jma declared the system a tropical depression early on september 17 the jma upgraded it to tropical storm yagi later that morning as it moved erratically through the open pacific ocean and the jtwc soon followed suit the name yagi was submitted by japan and means capricornus goat yagi was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the jma on september 18 and the jtwc designated it a typhoon later that day the jma officially upgraded yagi to typhoon status early on september 19 yagi was upgraded briefly to a super typhoon by the jtwc from september 21 to 22 on september 23 the jtwc reported that yagi was becoming extratropical as it continued to weaken and issued its final warning the next day the jma downgraded yagi to a severe tropical storm on september 24 it was the third tropical cyclone in the nw pacific basin that attained category5 status in 2006 it started to recurve near chichi-jima and never affected major land areas it became extratropical near the western aleutians on september 25 its extratropical remnants crossed the basin on september 27the china meteorological administration cma and hong kong observatory both identified a tropical depression in the southern south china sea on september 22 the system was organized enough to be classified as tropical depression 17w by the jtwc the next day it weakened under heavy vertical wind shear and the jtwc issued its final advisory on tropical depression 17w before landfall in vietnam the storm passed just south of hainan and brought heavy rain to the area the maximum rainfall recorded was 143mm cma kept it as a tropical storm until it made landfall in vietnam in the morning of september 25on september 25 the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa named an active low pressure area within its area of responsibility tropical depression milenyo after issuing a tropical cyclone formation alert earlier the joint typhoon warning center issued its first warning on tropical depression 18w on september 26 the japan meteorological agency named this system xangsane the name xangsane was submitted by laos and means elephant later that day the jma upgraded xangsane to a severe tropical storm a bout of rapid intensification followed and all three agencies the jma jtwc and pagasa all upgraded the storm to a typhoon late on september 26 or early september 27 xangsane made landfall on samar island as a severe tropical stormthe typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in the philippines to avoid the storm transit authorities kept seacraft at several ports in the archipelago leaving over 3,500 passengers stranded xangsane also prompted philippine officials to close all schools financial markets and government offices in and around manila the typhoon killed over 200people in the country and produced strong winds and rainfall downing power lines and causing mudflows the strong winds caused moderate crop damage totaling to 7.2million 2006usdxangsane made landfall as a typhoon near hu early on october 1 the jtwc stopped issuing advisories soon after and the jma downgraded it to a severe tropical storm xangsane killed 71 in vietnamon october 1 a persistent area of low pressure just east of the philippines developed into tropical depression 19w the jma had already been monitoring the storm it was named neneng by pagasa and later that evening was upgraded to a tropical storm by the philippine authorities the jma and jtwc both designated the storm a tropical storm the next day and it was named bebinca by the jma bebinca is a type of macanese milk puddingthe jtwc downgraded it to a tropical depression briefly between october 4 and 5 as wind shear took its toll its low-level circulation then became exposed with dry air entering the system and both the jma and jtwc declared the storm as a dissipating tropical depression on october 6 it soon became entrained within the circulation of a storm-force extratropical low which swept across the honsh coastal waters and led to 33people dead or missing it was upgraded to a severe tropical storm in post analysison october 3 a tropical depression south of minami torishima in high sea-surface temperatures gained enough convection and was designated tropical storm rumbia by the jma although the jtwc had not even carried it as a tropical depression later that day the jtwc issued a tropical cyclone formation alert and began warnings on tropical depression 20w the next day rumbia slowly began to intensify while moving to the northwest but on october 6 its low-level circulation became fully exposed and the jtwc issued a final warning the jma followed suit soon after the remnants of rumbia later became extremely elongated on october 6 before being absorbed into the large extratropical low of bebinca the name rumbia comes from a type of palm tree known as the sago palmon october6 a tropical disturbance formed about 240km 150mi north-northeast of kwajalein with convection nearby developing a low pressure area two days later on october8 the jma began monitoring the system as a tropical depression upgrading it to tropical storm soulik the next day while the jtwc classified it as tropical depression 21w an anticyclone to the north and a tropical upper tropospheric trough cell to the west provided outflow for the system soulik tracked northwestward around a ridge slowly intensifying due to wind shear in the region around 1200utc on october10 the jtwc upgraded soulik to a typhoon and the jma followed suit late on october12 another ridge west of soulik turned the storm northward and the influence of both ridges caused soulik to become nearly stationary about 100km 65mi south-southwest of iwo jima according to the jtwc soulik attained 1minute winds of 165kmh 105mph while the jma reported 10minute winds of 140kmh 85mph at 0600utc on october14 soulik passed within 40km 25mi of iwo jima according to the jtwc this would place the island within an area affected by typhoon-force winds later that day an approaching trough increased the wind shear causing the typhoon to weaken by 1200utc on october16 soulik had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as it rapidly traveled towards the northeast the remnants were last noted south of the aleutian islands on october17at 0600utc on october9 a tropical storm watch was issued for agrihan in the northern mariana islands upgraded to a warning the next day during the storms passage a total of 206mm 8.11in of rain was recorded on pagan island sustained winds on the island reached 58kmh 36mph and gusts reached 122kmh 76mph although there was no damage in the region waves up to 7.6m 25ft affected the bonin islands on iwo jima winds were recorded up to 160kmh 100mph with gusts up to 210kmh 130mph although soulik spent over a day near iwo jima no damage was reported as a result of the stormon october 12 a tropical disturbance that had been meandering in the philippine area of responsibility was designated tropical depression ompong by pagasa the depression slowly moved westward toward the philippines but wind shear from typhoon soulik prevented any intensification the depression degenerated into an area of low pressure early the next dayan area of disturbed weather developed northwest of chuuk on october 24 the disturbance moved west-northwestward over the next two days and gradually became better organized and the joint typhoon warning center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system on october 26 the system was designated tropical depression 22w by the jtwc later that day the system continued to strengthen and the jtwc upgraded it to a tropical storm on october 27 the japan meteorological agency later followed suit and designated the system tropical storm cimaron the name cimaron was submitted by the philippines and is a type of wild ox the system quickly intensified and was upgraded to a severe tropical storm by the jma later that day the system continued its quick intensification and was upgraded to a typhoon by both the jtwc and jma on october 28 further intensification occurred overnight and the typhoon had rapidly deepened 65 hpa in 24 hours from 985hpa to 920hpa causing the jtwc to upgrade it to a 140-kn super typhoon at 9am utc on october 29 it made landfall at about 12:30pm utc the same day on northern luzon there especially in isabela province it lashed winds as much as 195kmh and gusts as much as 230kmh actually all or parts of four provinces isabela quirino cagayan and aurora are declared under signal no 4 as the typhoon struck the islandcimaron then re-intensified after crossing the island but not to its original strength and was expected to curve towards hainan instead of moving towards vietnam as previously forecast on november 1 the jtwc upgraded the typhoon back into a category3-equivalent storm and forecast that it would make a direct impact on hong kong however prediction models showed conflicting forecasts and cimaron remained quasi-stationary and weakened to a severe tropical storm on november 2 dry air entrainment caused further weakening with the jtwc dropping it to a minimal tropical storm at 3pm utc the next day it weakened further upwelling itself the jtwc issued its final warning at 3pm utc on november 4 the jma continued advisories on cimaron until 12am utc on november 6 when it was downgraded to a weak tropical depressionthe typhoon killed at least 19people many of whom drowned and left 15 missing in the northern philippines it also killed a woman and her child after both are hit by a sheet of galvanized iron in dilasag aurora province serving as the first human casualties further casualties happened as the typhoon passed through luzon despite these however classes in metro manila were still not suspended it also caused at least us9million in damage 90% of the houses were damaged in a coastal town near where cimaron made landfall in the aftermath of the storms passage across the philippines the swedish international development cooperation agency contributed 2.5million swedish krona us350,000 to aid effortsan area of disturbed weather developed east of the mariana islands on october 31 and moved west-northwestward over the next week without any increase in organization due to an unfavorable environment until november 6 when it encountered more favorable conditions and the japan meteorological agency declared it a tropical depression on november 8 the joint typhoon warning center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on the system later that day and pagasa named the system tropical depression queenie shortly after the jtwc classified it as tropical depression 23w early on november 9 according to the jtwc lack of equatorial outflow prevented rapid intensification of the system later that day at 12pm utc the jma upgraded it to a tropical storm named it chebi the name jebi the correct spelling means swallow in korean the jtwc and pagasa both followed suit later that day early on november 10 the jma upgraded chebi to a severe tropical storm as it continued to move west towards the philippines following a similar track as typhoon cimaron earlier in the seasonjust hours later the jma upgraded chebi from severe tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of 55knots to a typhoon with winds of 95knots with a pressure decrease of 40 hpa over three hours the jtwc followed suit upping chebi from a tropical storm with 1-minute sustained winds of 55knots to a category 4-equivalent typhoon at 9am utc pagasa raised public storm warning signal no 4 for three provinces in luzon making chebi the second storm typhoon cimaron served as the first one that year in as many weeks to force a signal 4 after rapidly deepening chebi weakened as it approached the philippines it made its first landfall near casiguran aurora early on november 11 crossed the lingayen gulf and its second landfall on barangay lucap alaminos city about 8 hours laterencountering dry air entrainment and increased vertical wind shear in the south china sea chebi began to gradually weaken to a severe tropical storm on november 12 it continued to weaken turning northwards towards hainan and was downgraded to a tropical storm the next day on november 14 the jma issued its last advisory on the dissipating tropical depression the jtwc issued its final warning later that same day as chebi dissipated under the strong shearall told the typhoon caused further casualties as well as damage caused by the earlier typhoon cimaron after passing through luzon it left 1 dead and 10 injured in aurora province it caused floods cutting the provinces road system as well as zero visibility further isolating it from relief effortsan area of disturbed weather developed southeast of chuuk on november 24 wind shear near the disturbance soon decreased allowing the depression to organize a little it was designated a tropical depression by japan meteorological agency on november 25 and later that day the joint typhoon warning center started issuing warnings on the system as it moved west-northwest towards yap the depression strengthened because it was in an area of high sea-surface temperatures and there were distinct cloud features of anticyclonic outflow according to the jma it was upgraded to a tropical storm on the afternoon of november 26 and named durian the name durian refers to a fruit durio zibethinus and was submitted to the naming list by thailandmoving west to west-northwestward durian intensified slowly it became a severe tropical storm on november 27 and the next day it was named reming by pagasa when it entered the philippine area of responsibility later on november 28 both the jma and jtwc upgraded it to a typhoon as it continued to track towards the philippines a quick bout of intensification occurred on november 29 causing the jma to upgrade the storm to 100knots in wind intensity and the jtwc to give it a dvorak classification of 6.5 127kn in a satellite fix in 6 hours durian intensified from 90 kn 1-minute sustained winds to 125kn winds the jtwc then forecast a direct hit over metro manila later that day when it upgraded the storm to a super typhoon pagasa raised public storm warning signal 4 its highest warning level over catanduanes albay camarines norte and camarines sur it was the third time in 2006 and the third time in a row that pagasa raised signal 4 durian began to weaken slightly as it approached land undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle but quickly regained peak strengthpagasa claimed that the storm made landfall on the morning of november 30 over southern catanduanes although the jma and jtwc did not recognize this landfall durian then made another landfall after crossing the lagonoy gulf in northeastern albay after weakening due to interaction with land durian was downgraded back to a typhoon by the jtwc the storm continued to move west making landfalls on the bondoc peninsula in quezon on marinduque and finally on oriental mindoro before exiting to the south china seaencountering dry air entrainment and vertical wind shear durian weakened slightly at first but slowly began to reorganise and restrengthen as it neared vietnam durian began to turn slightly southwest towards nha trang and ho chi minh city on december 3 eventually durian began to weaken again and by december 4 the jma downgraded it to a severe tropical storm the storm maintained intensity as it skirted the vietnamese coast moving southwest after a brief second stint at typhoon strength durian finally made landfall in bn tre province on december 5 the system rapidly weakened over land and the jma downgraded it to a tropical storm the jma and jtwc issued their final advisories later that day as durian emerged into the gulf of thailand as a weak tropical depression the remnants of durian then crossed the coast of southern thailand as it moved into the bay of bengalthe storm killed at least 720 in the philippines the most damage occurred in albay province where the storm created mudslides of volcanic ash and boulders off mayon volcano the padang barangay of legazpi city was severely affected with a large portion of the town covered in mud up to houses roofs at least 81people have died and 16people are missing in vietnam from the stormon december 2 an area of convection was spotted by the joint typhoon warning center southeast of chuuk although convection decreased in the next few hours on december 5 the jtwc once again noted flaring deep convection and late on december 6 a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued on the morning of december 7 both the jtwc and japan meteorological agency-rsmc tokyo reported that a tropical depression had formed soon after the depression entered the area of responsibility of pagasa who named it seniang the depression strengthened throughout the day and the jma upgraded it to tropical storm utor later that day the name utor was submitted by the united states on behalf of the marshall islands and is a marshallese word for squall linesignal no3 has been raised in the provinces of cebuleytesamar provinceson december 8 the jma upgraded utor to a severe tropical storm it intensified further and was upgraded to a typhoon by the jma on the morning of december 9 with pagasa and jtwc doing the same the storm made landfall shortly after noon local time the same day after crossing the philippines utor took a track similar to typhoon chebi in november first moving northwest then threatening to take aim at hong kong it restrengthened to an 85-kn typhoon before it slowed as it tracked in a weak steering environment within a weakness in the subtropical ridge it then weakened as wind shear increased and dry air entrainment occurred the jma downgraded it to a severe tropical storm on december 13 and to a tropical storm the same day the next day the jtwc downgraded the storm to a tropical storm and issued its last advisorythe 2006 asean and east asia summit originally scheduled to start december 10 was put back a month due to the storm typhoon utor killed at least 78 people and left 49 others missing in the philippines damages from the typhoon were estimated at 1.9million 2006 usdtyphoon utor was blamed for heavy rains of up to 350mm within 24 hours in southern peninsular malaysia specifically johor negeri sembilan melaka and pahang causing massive floods within the southern region on december 18 2006 which was considered as the worst in the malaysian southern region history however there were also reports a few days earlier that adverse weather was not to be blamed on the typhoon the worst-affected areas were segamat and kota tinggi where both towns were totally inaccessible by land after all main roads leading to those towns were all flooded until december 24 2006 the floods had claimed 8 liveson december 16 the japan meteorological agency started issuing public bulletins on a tropical depression southwest of guam the joint typhoon warning center initiated warnings on tropical depression 26w the next day despite having not issued a tropical cyclone formation alert the system was upgraded to a tropical storm by the jma and named trami which is a kind of rose tree this name was submitted by vietnam the storm moved west-northwest rapidly towards the philippines but struggled against wind shear and an approaching cold front entering the pagasa area of responsibility on december 18 as it maintained minimal tropical storm intensity it was named tomas the jtwc issued its final warning later that day having never upgraded the storm to tropical storm strength citing no indication of a significant low-level circulation centre on december 19 the jma downgraded the storm to a tropical depression and issued its last public bulletin as the storm dissipated over wateron march 7 the jma had upgraded a low-pressure area to a tropical depression formed by the remnants of 01w to the southeast of mindanao philippines during the next day the system moved overland and made landfall over in davao the system emerged to the sulu sea nearing palawan until it weakened back into a low-pressure are on march 10 on march 11 the same system emerged to the south china sea as the jma had re-upgraded it back to a tropical depression although the system had experienced shear and became an exposed system the depression fully dissipated late on march 12on july 3 both the china meteorological administration cma and the jma had identified a tropical depression about 200km south of sanya hainan the depression moved northwest and made landfall a in hainan on the same day the depression made its second landfall over in the border of northern vietnam and china as it rapidly deteriorated and absorbed by a front on july 4 early on july 21 the cma classified it as a tropical depression the cma issued its final warning on july 22 as it started to weaken rapidly the system was absorbed by typhoon kaemi and fully dissipated on july 25 the jma only classified the system as a low-pressure area throughout its lifetime on july 28 a tropical depression had rapidly organized and persisted over in the gulf of tonkin and made landfall in the same location as the previous system at its peak strength with a pressure of 998 mbar the system moved over land and fully dissipated on july 29 on september 13 two tropical depressions were monitored by the jma the first one persisted just south of hong kong and dissipated later on the same day the second system formed from a stationary front near taiwan and moved northwards by september 15 the system dissipated while making landfall over in south koreaa trio of tropical depressions were also monitored by the jma during late october the first developed on october 21 about north of the mariana islands the depression moved stationary until its circulation became exposed due to shear on october 23 the other two systems were also monitored very briefly by the jma during october 22 one in the south china sea as it moved westwards and fully dissipated six hours later where its remnants made landfall in vietnam during the next day whilst the other persisted over in the philippine sea also bringing rainfall to luzon during october 25 just before the arrival of typhoon cimaronwithin the north-western pacific ocean both the japan meteorological agency jma and the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the western pacific which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names the japan meteorological agencys rsmc tokyo typhoon center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the world meteorological organizations typhoon committee should they be judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65kmh 40mph while the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135e and 115e and between 5n-25n even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired by both pagasa and the typhoon committee should the list of names for the philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season unused names are marked in during the season 22 tropical storms developed in the western pacific and each one was named by the jma when the system was judged to have 10-minute sustained windspeeds of 65kmh 40mph the jma selected the names from a list of 140 names that had been developed by the 14 members nations and territories of the escapwmo typhoon committee after the season the typhoon committee retired the names chanchu bilis saomai xangsane and durian they were replaced with sanba maliksi son-tinh leepi and mangkhut respectivelyduring the season pagasa used its own naming scheme for the 19 tropical cyclones that either developed within or moved into their self-defined area of responsibility the names were taken from a list of names that had been last used during 2002 and was scheduled to be used again during 2010 many names were used for the first time as pagasa had revised their naming lists during 2003 although the name gloria from 2002 was retired and replaced with glenda as it was the name of the incumbent philippine president at that timeafter the season pagasa had stated that the names milenyo and reming will be retired as they had caused over php1 billion in damages and over 300 fatalities they were subsequently replaced on the list with mario and ruby both names however were retired after the 2014 season being replaced by maymay and rosita respectivelythis table summarizes all the systems that developed within or moved into the north pacific ocean to the west of the international date line during 2006 the tables also provide an overview of a systems intensity duration land areas affected and any deaths or damages associated with the system
