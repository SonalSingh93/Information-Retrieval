threedimensional space  wikipedia three-dimensional space also 3-space or rarely tri-dimensional space is a geometric setting in which three values called parameters are required to determine the position of an element ie point this is the informal meaning of the term dimensionin physics and mathematics a sequence of  numbers can be understood as a location in -dimensional space when  the set of all such locations is called three-dimensional euclidean space it is commonly represented by the symbol  this serves as a three-parameter model of the physical universe that is the spatial part without considering time in which all known matter exists however this space is only one example of a large variety of spaces in three dimensions called 3-manifolds in this classical example when the three values refer to measurements in different directions coordinates any three directions can be chosen provided that vectors in these directions do not all lie in the same 2-space plane furthermore in this case these three values can be labeled by any combination of three chosen from the terms width height depth and breadthin mathematics analytic geometry also called cartesian geometry describes every point in three-dimensional space by means of three coordinates three coordinate axes are given each perpendicular to the other two at the origin the point at which they cross they are usually labeled  and  relative to these axes the position of any point in three-dimensional space is given by an ordered triple of real numbers each number giving the distance of that point from the origin measured along the given axis which is equal to the distance of that point from the plane determined by the other two axesother popular methods of describing the location of a point in three-dimensional space include cylindrical coordinates and spherical coordinates though there are an infinite number of possible methods see euclidean spacebelow are images of the above-mentioned systemscartesian coordinate systemcylindrical coordinate systemspherical coordinate systemtwo distinct points always determine a straight line three distinct points are either collinear or determine a unique plane four distinct points can either be collinear coplanar or determine the entire spacetwo distinct lines can either intersect be parallel or be skew two parallel lines or two intersecting lines lie in a unique plane so skew lines are lines that do not meet and do not lie in a common planetwo distinct planes can either meet in a common line or are parallel do not meet three distinct planes no pair of which are parallel can either meet in a common line meet in a unique common point or have no point in common in the last case the three lines of intersection of each pair of planes are mutually parallela line can lie in a given plane intersect that plane in a unique point or be parallel to the plane in the last case there will be lines in the plane that are parallel to the given linea hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than the dimension of the full space the hyperplanes of a three-dimensional space are the two-dimensional subspaces that is the planes in terms of cartesian coordinates the points of a hyperplane satisfy a single linear equation so planes in this 3-space are described by linear equations a line can be described by a pair of independent linear equations each representing a plane having this line as a common intersectionvarignons theorem states that the midpoints of any quadrilateral in  form a parallelogram and so are coplanara sphere in 3-space also called a 2-sphere because it is a 2-dimensional object consists of the set of all points in 3-space at a fixed distance  from a central point  the solid enclosed by the sphere is called a ball or more precisely a 3-ball the volume of the ball is given byanother type of sphere arises from a 4-ball whose three-dimensional surface is the 3-sphere points equidistant to the origin of the euclidean space  if a point has coordinates  then  characterizes those points on the unit 3-sphere centered at the originin three dimensions there are nine regular polytopes the five convex platonic solids and the four nonconvex kepler-poinsot polyhedraa surface generated by revolving a plane curve about a fixed line in its plane as an axis is called a surface of revolution the plane curve is called the generatrix of the surface a section of the surface made by intersecting the surface with a plane that is perpendicular orthogonal to the axis is a circlesimple examples occur when the generatrix is a line if the generatrix line intersects the axis line the surface of revolution is a right circular cone with vertex apex the point of intersection however if the generatrix and axis are parallel the surface of revolution is a circular cylinderin analogy with the conic sections the set of points whose cartesian coordinates satisfy the general equation of the second degree namelywhere  and  are real numbers and not all of  and  are zero is called a quadric surfacethere are six types of non-degenerate quadric surfacesthe degenerate quadric surfaces are the empty set a single point a single line a single plane a pair of planes or a quadratic cylinder a surface consisting of a non-degenerate conic section in a plane  and all the lines of  through that conic that are normal to  elliptic cones are sometimes considered to be degenerate quadric surfaces as wellboth the hyperboloid of one sheet and the hyperbolic paraboloid are ruled surfaces meaning that they can be made up from a family of straight lines in fact each has two families of generating lines the members of each family are disjoint and each member one family intersects with just one exception every member of the other family each family is called a regulusanother way of viewing three-dimensional space is found in linear algebra where the idea of independence is crucial space has three dimensions because the length of a box is independent of its width or breadth in the technical language of linear algebra space is three-dimensional because every point in space can be described by a linear combination of three independent vectorsa vector can be pictured as an arrow the vectors magnitude is its length and its direction is the direction the arrow points a vector in  can be represented by an ordered triple of real numbers these numbers are called the components of the vectorthe dot product of two vectors  and  is defined asthe magnitude of a vector  is denoted by  the dot product of a vector  with itself iswhich givesthe formula for the euclidean length of the vectorwithout reference to the components of the vectors the dot product of two non-zero euclidean vectors  and  is given bywhere  is the angle between  and the cross product or vector product is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space and is denoted by the symbol  the cross product a  b of the vectors a and b is a vector that is perpendicular to both and therefore normal to the plane containing them it has many applications in mathematics physics and engineeringthe space and product form an algebra over a field which is neither commutative nor associative but is a lie algebra with the cross product being the lie bracketone can in n dimensions take the product of  vectors to produce a vector perpendicular to all of them but if the product is limited to non-trivial binary products with vector results it exists only in three and seven dimensionsin a rectangular coordinate system the gradient is given bythe divergence of a continuously differentiable vector field f  u i  v j  w k is equal to the scalar-valued functionexpanded in cartesian coordinates see del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates for spherical and cylindrical coordinate representations the curl   f is for f composed of fx fy fzwhere i j and k are the unit vectors for the x- y- and z-axes respectively this expands as followsfor some scalar field f u  r  r the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve c  u is defined aswhere r a b  c is an arbitrary bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of c and for a vector field f u  r  r the line integral along a piecewise smooth curve c  u in the direction of r is defined aswhere  is the dot product and r a b  c is a bijective parametrization of the curve c such that ra and rb give the endpoints of ca surface integral is a generalization of multiple integrals to integration over surfaces it can be thought of as the double integral analog of the line integral to find an explicit formula for the surface integral we need to parameterize the surface of interest s by considering a system of curvilinear coordinates on s like the latitude and longitude on a sphere let such a parameterization be xs t where s t varies in some region t in the plane then the surface integral is given bywhere the expression between bars on the right-hand side is the magnitude of the cross product of the partial derivatives of xs t and is known as the surface element given a vector field v on s that is a function that assigns to each x in s a vector vx the surface integral can be defined component-wise according to the definition of the surface integral of a scalar field the result is a vectora volume integral refers to an integral over a 3-dimensional domainit can also mean a triple integral within a region d in r of a function  and is usually written asthe fundamental theorem of line integrals says that a line integral through a gradient field can be evaluated by evaluating the original scalar field at the endpoints of the curvelet  thenstokes theorem relates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field f over a surface  in euclidean three-space to the line integral of the vector field over its boundary suppose  is a subset of  in the case of  represents a volume in 3d space
