cyclone agni  wikipedia severe cyclonic storm agni was a tropical cyclone of the 2004 north indian ocean cyclone season notable for its record proximity to the equator it was the second north indian ocean cyclone to receive a name after onil earlier in the year agni formed on november28 well to the southwest of india in the arabian sea and steadily intensified as it tracked northwestward the joint typhoon warning center jtwc estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 120kmh 75mph while the india meteorological department imd estimated peak 3minute sustained winds of 100kmh 65mph the imd is the official warning center for the north indian ocean after peaking it weakened due to wind shear dry air and cooler waters and the jtwc issued its final advisory on december3 as it approached the coast of somalia the remnants of agni moved along the somalian coastline until dissipating on december5a tropical disturbance was observed on november19 about 800km 500mi southeast of colombo sri lanka in the bay of bengal the disturbance tracked westward gradually organizing and prompting the jtwc to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert tcfa on november22 after passing south of sri lanka it became disorganized and was no longer considered likely to develop into a tropical cyclone the circulation associated with the system continued westward reorganizing on november26 in the arabian sea despite being located unusually close to the equator the disturbance maintained convection or thunderstorms which was becoming organized around the weak low-level circulation with low wind shear and diffluence aloft the jtwc remarked the system had a fair chance of developingwhile the system was organizing the center crossed the equator to reach about 0.5s thus becoming an anticyclonic circulation in the southern hemisphere this was unusual as the coriolis effect is nonexistent along the equatorthe coriolis effect refers to planetary vorticity which provides the spin in a cyclone the jtwc later assessed the system as remaining in the northern hemisphere reaching as far south as 0.7n or about 80km 50mi from the equator after the circulation organized further beneath the convection the jtwc issued another tcfa at 0300utc on november28 three hours later the agency classified the system as tropical cyclone 05a about 1300km 800mi southwest of the southern tip of india in a post-season analysis the jtwc estimated the cyclone became a tropical storm six hours earlier at around the same time the imd classified it as a low pressure area likely to become well markedupon being classified the tropical cyclone was moving northwestward under the influence of a ridge over india its outflow to the north and south became better defined although its proximity to the equator limited its southerly outflow somewhat due to wind shear early on november29 the imd classified the system as a depression and throughout the day it rapidly intensified to become a cyclonic storm a cyclonic storm is a tropical cyclone with at least 65kmh 40mph winds sustained for 3minutes around that time the jtwc assessed the cyclone as reaching peak winds of 120kmh 75mph sustained for 1minute along with gusts to 150kmh 90mph late on november29 the cyclone weakened slightly only to regain its peak intensity by november30 at that time it developed a banding eye and was located about 1500km 900mi southeast of the coast of somalia at 1200utc on november30 the imd issued its first complete advisory on the cyclone naming it severe cyclonic storm agni and estimating peak winds at 100kmh 65mph the agency predicted the storm would continue northwestward and strengthen slightly before weakening at its peak the cyclone had a barometric pressure of 985mbarafter reaching peak intensity an increase in wind shear caused the eye to disappear and the convection decreased significantly on december1 the imd estimated agni weakened to cyclonic storm status around which time the center became exposed from the convection the cyclone continued its steady weakening continued due to the wind shear the presence of dry air and cooler water temperatures and by december2 the imd downgraded agni to depression status which was its final warning on the system as it approached the coast of somalia it turned westward due to the building of a ridge over saudi arabia despite unfavorable conditions thunderstorms briefly reformed over the circulation which allowed the storm to maintain its intensity by late on december3 agni weakened to below tropical storm status and the jtwc issued its final warning while the storm was about 450km 275mi south-southeast of cape guardafuithe easternmost point of the horn of africa the circulation became difficult to locate by early on december4 by which time the system had little remaining convection it turned southwestward and later to the south moving ashore on eastern somalia before dissipating on december5 near ceel huur over wateraccording to rsmc new delhi cyclone agni developed into a depression at 1.5n which is the same latitude as where according to rsmc tokyo tropical storm vamei formed during december 2001 however according to rsmc la reunion the precursor low to cyclone agni moved into the southern hemisphere and became an anticyclone as it had kept its counter-clockwise circulationagni was the second storm in the north indian ocean to receive a name after the imd began tropical cyclone naming in the middle of 2004as the cyclone was weak when it moved over somalia no casualties or significant damage was reported
