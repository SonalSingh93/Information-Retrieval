atmosphere  unit   wikipedia the standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as pa bar it is sometimes used as a reference or standard pressurein 1954 the 10th confrence gnrale des poids et mesures cgpm adopted standard atmosphere for general use and affirmed its definition of being precisely equal to 1,013,250 dynes per square centimetre 101325pa this value was intended to represent the mean atmospheric pressure at mean sea level at the latitude of paris france and does reflect the mean sea level pressure for many industrialized nations that are at broadly similar latitudesin chemistry and in various industries the reference pressure referred to in standard temperature and pressure stp was commonly 1atm 101.325kpa but standards have since diverged in 1982 the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac recommended that for the purposes of specifying the physical properties of substances standard pressure should be precisely 100kpa 1bar 10dyncm 1mmhga pressure of 1atm can also be stated asscuba divers and others use the word atmosphere and atm in relation to pressures that are relative to mean atmospheric pressure at sea level 1.013 bar for example a partial pressure of oxygen is calibrated typically using air at sea level so is expressed in units of atmthe old european unit technical atmosphere at is equal to 1 kilogram-force per square centimetre kgfcm pa
