rainband  wikipedia a rainband is a cloud and precipitation structure associated with an area of rainfall which is significantly elongated rainbands can be stratiform or convective and are generated by differences in temperature when noted on weather radar imagery this precipitation elongation is referred to as banded structure rainbands within tropical cyclones are curved in orientation tropical cyclone rainbands contain showers and thunderstorms that together with the eyewall and the eye constitute a hurricane or tropical storm the extent of rainbands around a tropical cyclone can help determine the cyclones intensityrainbands spawned near and ahead of cold fronts can be squall lines which are able to produce tornadoes rainbands associated with cold fronts can be warped by mountain barriers perpendicular to the fronts orientation due to the formation of a low-level barrier jet bands of thunderstorms can form with sea breeze and land breeze boundaries if enough moisture is present if sea breeze rainbands become active enough just ahead of a cold front they can mask the location of the cold front itself banding within the comma head precipitation pattern of an extratropical cyclone can yield significant amounts of rain or snow behind extratropical cyclones rainbands can form downwind of relative warm bodies of water such as the great lakes if the atmosphere is cold enough these rainbands can yield heavy snowrainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak upward motion and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature in an atmosphere with rich low level moisture and vertical wind shear narrow convective rainbands known as squall lines generally in the cyclones warm sector ahead of strong cold fronts associated with extratropical cyclones wider rain bands can occur behind cold fronts which tend to have more stratiform and less convective precipitation within the cold sector north to northwest of a cyclone center in colder cyclones small scale or mesoscale bands of heavy snow can occur within a cyclones comma head precipitation pattern with a width of 32 kilometres 20mi to 80 kilometres 50mi these bands in the comma head are associated with areas of frontogensis or zones of strengthening temperature contrast southwest of extratropical cyclones curved flow bringing cold air across the relatively warm great lakes can lead to narrow lake effect snow bands which bring significant localized snowfallrainbands exist in the periphery of tropical cyclones which point towards the cyclones center of low pressure rainbands within tropical cyclones require ample moisture and a low level pool of cooler air bands located 80 kilometres 50mi to 150 kilometres 93mi from a cyclones center migrate outward they are capable of producing heavy rains and squalls of wind as well as tornadoes particularly in the storms right-front quadrantsome rainbands move closer to the center forming a secondary or outer eyewall within intense hurricanes spiral rainbands are such a basic structure to a tropical cyclone that in most tropical cyclone basins use of the satellite-based dvorak technique is the primary method used to determine a tropical cyclones maximum sustained winds within this method the extent of spiral banding and difference in temperature between the eye and eyewall is used to assign a maximum sustained wind and a central pressure central pressure values for their centers of low pressure derived from this technique are approximatedifferent programs have been studying these rainbands including rainexconvective rainbands can form parallel to terrain on its windward side due to lee waves triggered by hills just upstream of the clouds formation their spacing is normally 5 kilometres 3.1mi to 10 kilometres 6.2mi apart when bands of precipitation near frontal zones approach steep topography a low-level barrier jet stream forms parallel to and just prior to the mountain ridge which slows down the frontal rainband just prior to the mountain barrier if enough moisture is present sea breeze and land breeze fronts can form convective rainbands sea breeze front thunderstorm lines can become strong enough to mask the location of an approaching cold front by evening the edge of ocean currents can lead to the development of thunderstorm bands due to heat differential at this interface downwind of islands bands of showers and thunderstorms can develop due to low level wind convergence downwind of the island edges offshore california this has been noted in the wake of cold fronts
