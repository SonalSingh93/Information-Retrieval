microburst  wikipedia a microburst is a small downdraft that moves in a way opposite to a tornado microbursts are found in strong thunderstorms there are two types of microbursts within a thunderstorm wet microbursts and dry microbursts they go through three stages in their cycle the downburst outburst and cushion stages a microburst can be particularly dangerous to aircraft especially during landing due to the wind shear caused by its gust front several fatal and historic crashes have been attributed to the phenomenon over the past several decades and flight crew training goes to great lengths on how to properly recover from a microburstwind shear eventa microburst often has high winds that can knock over fully grown trees they usually last from a couple of seconds to several minutesthe term was defined by mesoscale meteorology expert ted fujita as affecting an area 4km 2.5mi in diameter or less distinguishing them as a type of downburst and apart from common wind shear which can encompass greater areas fujita also coined the term macroburst for downbursts larger than 4km 2.5mia distinction can be made between a wet microburst which consists of precipitation and a dry microburst which typically consists of virga they generally are formed by precipitation-cooled air rushing to the surface but they perhaps also could be powered from the high speed winds of the jet stream deflected toward the surface by a thunderstorm or by dynamical processes see rear flank downdraftmicrobursts are recognized as capable of generating wind speeds higher than 75ms 170mph 270kmhmicrobursts have also been called air bombswhen rain falls below the cloud base or is mixed with dry air it begins to evaporate and this evaporation process cools the air the cool air descends and accelerates as it approaches the ground when the cool air approaches the ground it spreads out in all directions and this divergence of the wind is the signature of the microburst high winds spread out in this type of pattern showing little or no curvature are known as straight-line windsdry microbursts produced by high based thunderstorms that generate little to no surface rainfall occur in environments characterized by a thermodynamic profile exhibiting an inverted-v at thermal and moisture profile as viewed on a skew-t log-p thermodynamic diagram wakimoto 1985 developed a conceptual model over the high plains of the united states of a dry microburst environment that comprised three important variables mid-level moisture a deep and dry adiabatic lapse rate in the sub-cloud layer and low surface relative humiditywet microbursts are downbursts accompanied by significant precipitation at the surface which are warmer than their environment wakimoto 1998 these downbursts rely more on the drag of precipitation for downward acceleration of parcels than negative buoyancy which tend to drive dry microbursts as a result higher mixing ratios are necessary for these downbursts to form hence the name wet microbursts melting of ice particularly hail appears to play an important role in downburst formation wakimoto and bringi 1988 especially in the lowest 1km 0.62mi above ground level proctor 1989 these factors among others make forecasting wet microbursts difficultthe evolution of downbursts is broken down into three stages the contact stage the outburst stage and the cushion stagea downburst initially develops as the downdraft begins its descent from the cloud base the downdraft accelerates and within minutes reaches the ground contact stage it is during the contact stage the highest winds are observedduring the outburst stage the wind curls as the cold air of the downburst moves away from the point of impact with the groundduring the cushion stage winds about the curl continue to accelerate while the winds at the surface slow due to frictionwhen the two plates hit each other it forms a tornado and is very dangerous for a aircraft to land in this situationstart by using the vertical momentum equationby decomposing the variables into a basic state and a perturbation defining the basic states and using the ideal gas law  then the equation can be written in the formwhere b is buoyancy the virtual temperature correction usually is rather small and to a good approximation it can be ignored when computing buoyancy finally the effects of precipitation loading on the vertical motion are parametrized by including a term that decreases buoyancy as the liquid water mixing ratio  increases leading to the final form of the parcels momentum equationthe first term is the effect of perturbation pressure gradients on vertical motion in some storms this term has a large effect on updrafts rotunno and klemp 1982 but there is not much reason to believe it has much of an impact on downdrafts at least to a first approximation and therefore will be ignoredthe second term is the effect of buoyancy on vertical motion clearly in the case of microbursts one expects to find that b is negative meaning the parcel is cooler than its environment this cooling typically takes place as a result of phase changes evaporation melting and sublimation precipitation particles that are small but are in great quantity promote a maximum contribution to cooling and hence to creation of negative buoyancy the major contribution to this process is from evaporationthe last term is the effect of water loading whereas evaporation is promoted by large numbers of small droplets it only requires a few large drops to contribute substantially to the downward acceleration of air parcels this term is associated with storms having high precipitation rates comparing the effects of water loading to those associated with buoyancy if a parcel has a liquid water mixing ratio of 1.0 g kg this is roughly equivalent to about 0.3 k of negative buoyancy the latter is a large but not extreme value therefore in general terms negative buoyancy is typically the major contributor to downdraftsusing pure parcel theory results in a prediction of the maximum downdraft ofwhere nape is the negative available potential energyand where lfs denotes the level of free sink for a descending parcel and sfc denotes the surface this means that the maximum downward motion is associated with the integrated negative buoyancy even a relatively modest negative buoyancy can result in a substantial downdraft if it is maintained over a relatively large depth a downward speed of 25ms 56mph 90kmh results from the relatively modest nape value of 312.5 m s to a first approximation the maximum gust is roughly equal to the maximum downdraft speedthe scale and suddenness of a microburst makes it a notorious danger to aircraft particularly those at low altitude which are taking off or landing the following are some fatal crashes andor aircraft incidents that have been attributed to microbursts in the vicinity of airportsa microburst often causes aircraft to crash when they are attempting to land the above-mentioned boac and pan am flights are notable exceptions the microburst is an extremely powerful gust of air that once hitting the ground spreads in all directions as the aircraft is coming in to land the pilots try to slow the plane to an appropriate speed when the microburst hits the pilots will see a large spike in their airspeed caused by the force of the headwind created by the microburst a pilot inexperienced with microbursts would try to decrease the speed the plane would then travel through the microburst and fly into the tailwind causing a sudden decrease in the amount of air flowing across the wings the decrease in airflow over the wings of the aircraft causes a drop in the amount of lift produced this decrease in lift combined with a strong downward flow of air can cause the thrust required to remain at altitude to exceed what is available thus causing the aircraft to stall if the plane is at a low altitude shortly after takeoff or during landing it will not have sufficient altitude to recoverthe strongest microburst recorded thus far occurred at andrews field maryland on august 1st 1983 with wind speeds reaching 240.5 kmh 149.5
