atmospheric pressure  wikipedia atmospheric pressure sometimes also called barometric pressure is the pressure within the atmosphere of earth or that of another planet in most circumstances atmospheric pressure is closely approximated by the hydrostatic pressure caused by the weight of air above the measurement point as elevation increases there is less overlying atmospheric mass so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation pressure measures force per unit area with si units of pascals 1 pa  1 nm on average a column of air one square centimetre cm 0.16sqin in cross-section measured from sea level to the top of the earths atmosphere has a mass of about 1.03 kilograms 2.3lb and weight of about 10.1 newtons 2.3lbf that weight across one square centimeter is a pressure of 10.1 ncm or 101knm kpa a column 1 square inch 6.5cm in cross-section would have a weight of about 14.7lb 6.7kg or about 65.4natmospheric pressure is caused by the gravitational attraction of the planet on the atmospheric gases above the surface and is a function of the mass of the planet the radius of the surface and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmosphere it is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity density variations due to temperature and variations in compositionthe standard atmosphere symbol atm is a unit of pressure defined as pa bar equivalent to 760 mmhg torr 29.92 inhg and 14.696 psithe mean sea level pressure mslp is the average atmospheric pressure at sea level this is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio television and newspapers or on the internet when barometers in the home are set to match the local weather reports they measure pressure adjusted to sea level not the actual local atmospheric pressurethe altimeter setting in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustmentaverage sea-level pressure is 1013.25mbar 101.325kpa 29.921inhg 760.00mmhg in aviation weather reports metar qnh is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals 1 hectopascal  1 millibar except in the united states canada and colombia where it is reported in inches to two decimal places of mercury the united states and canada also report sea level pressure slp which is adjusted to sea level by a different method in the remarks section not in the internationally transmitted part of the code in hectopascals or millibars however in canadas public weather reports sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascalsin the us weather code remarks three digits are all that are transmitted decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted 1013.2mbar 101.32kpa is transmitted as 132 1000.0mbar 100.00kpa is transmitted as 000 998.7 mbar is transmitted as 987 etc the highest sea-level pressure on earth occurs in siberia where the siberian high often attains a sea-level pressure above 1050mbar 105kpa 31inhg with record highs close to 1085mbar 108.5kpa 32.0inhg the lowest measurable sea-level pressure is found at the centers of tropical cyclones and tornadoes with a record low of 870mbar 87kpa 26inhg see atmospheric pressure recordspressure varies smoothly from the earths surface to the top of the mesosphere although the pressure changes with the weather nasa has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round as altitude increases atmospheric pressure decreases one can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure the graph at right was developed for a temperature of 15c and a relative humidity of 0%at low altitudes above sea level the pressure decreases by about 1.2kpa for every 100metres for higher altitudes within the troposphere the following equation the barometric formula relates atmospheric pressure p to altitude hwhere the constant parameters are as described belowatmospheric pressure varies widely on earth and these changes are important in studying weather and climate see pressure system for the effects of air pressure variations on weatheratmospheric pressure shows a diurnal or semidiurnal twice-daily cycle caused by global atmospheric tides this effect is strongest in tropical zones with an amplitude of a few millibars and almost zero in polar areas these variations have two superimposed cycles a circadian 24h cycle and semi-circadian 12h cyclethe highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded on earth above 750 meters was 1085.7hpa 32.06inhg measured in tosontsengel mongolia on 19 december 2001 the highest adjusted-to-sea level barometric pressure ever recorded below 750 meters was at agata in evenk autonomous okrug russia 6653n 9328e elevation 261m 856ft on 31 december 1968 of 1083.8hpa 32.005inhg the discrimination is due to the problematic assumptions assuming a standard lapse rate associated with reduction of sea level from high elevationsthe dead sea the lowest place on earth at 430 metres 1,410ft below sea level has a correspondingly high typical atmospheric pressure of 1065 hpathe lowest non-tornadic atmospheric pressure ever measured was 870hpa 0.858atm 25.69inhg set on 12 october 1979 during typhoon tip in the western pacific ocean the measurement was based on an instrumental observation made from a reconnaissance aircraftone atmosphere 101kpa or 14.7psi is also the pressure caused by the weight of a column of fresh water of approximately 10.3m 33.8ft thus a diver 10.3m underwater experiences a pressure of about 2 atmospheres 1atm of air plus 1atm of water conversely 10.3m is the maximum height to which water can be raised using suction under standard atmospheric conditionslow pressures such as natural gas lines are sometimes specified in inches of water typically written as wc water column or wg inches water gauge a typical gas-using residential appliance in the us is rated for a maximum of 14wc which is approximately 35 hpa similar metric units with a wide variety of names and notation based on millimetres centimetres or metres are now less commonly usedpure water boils at 100c 212f at earths standard atmospheric pressure the boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure around the water because of this the boiling point of water is lower at lower pressure and higher at higher pressure cooking at high elevations therefore requires adjustments to recipes a rough approximation of elevation can be obtained by measuring the temperature at which water boils in the mid-19th century this method was used by explorersan important application of the knowledge that atmospheric pressure varies directly with altitude was in determining the height of hills and mountains thanks to the availability of reliable pressure measurement devices while in 1774 maskelyne was confirming newtons theory of gravitation at and on schiehallion in scotland using plumb bob deviation to show the effect of gravity and accurately measure elevation william roy using barometric pressure was able to confirm his height determinations the agreement being to within one meter 3.28 feet this was then a useful tool for survey work and map making and long has continued to be useful it was part of the application of science which gave practical people the insight that applied science could easily and relatively cheaply be useful
