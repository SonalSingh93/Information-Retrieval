list of the most intense tropical cyclones  wikipedia tropical cyclone intensity is a complex topic winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds however variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make inter-comparison difficult in addition other impacts like rainfall storm surge area of wind damages and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds pressure is often used to compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on earth however although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds as each storms relationship between wind and pressure is slightly differentin the most recent and reliable records most tropical cyclones which attained a pressure of 900hpa mbar 26.56inhg or less occurred in the western north pacific ocean the strongest tropical cyclone recorded worldwide as measured by minimum central pressure was typhoon tip which reached a pressure of 870hpa 25.69inhg on october 12 1979 the following list is subdivided by basins data listed are provided by the official regional specialized meteorological centre unless otherwise noted on october 23 2015 hurricane patricia attained the strongest 1-minute sustained winds on record at 215mph 345kmhthe most intense storm in the north atlantic by lowest pressure was hurricane wilma the strongest storm by 1-minute sustained winds was hurricane allenstorms which reached a minimum central pressure of 920 hectopascals 27.17inhg or less are listed storm information has been compiled back to 1850 though measurements were rarer until aircraft reconnaissance started in the 1940s and inexact estimates were still predominant until dropsondes were implemented in the 1970s the most intense storm in the eastern pacific ocean by both sustained winds and central pressure was hurricane patricia its sustained winds of 345kmh 215mph are also the highest on record globallystorms with a minimum central pressure of 925hpa 27.32inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1949 and most storms since are only estimated because landfall and related reconnaissance are less common in this basinthe most intense storm by lowest pressure and peak 10-minute sustained winds was typhoon tip which was also the most intense tropical cyclone ever recordedstorms with a minimum pressure below 900hpa 26.58inhg are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1950the strongest tropical cyclone recorded in the north indian ocean is the 1999 odisha cyclone with 3-minute sustained winds of 260kmh 160mph and a minimum pressure of 912hpa 26.93inhgstorms with an intensity of 950hpa 28.05inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1971the most intense tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean is cyclone gafilo by 10-minute sustained wind speed the strongest tropical cyclone in the south-west indian ocean is cyclone fantalastorms with an intensity of 920hpa 27.17inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985the most intense tropical cyclones in the australian region are cyclone gwenda and cyclone inigo by 10-minute sustained wind speed the strongest are cyclone orson and cyclone monicastorms with an intensity of 922hpa 27.23inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985a total of 16 cyclones are listed down below reachingsurpassing that intensity which most of them occurred during el nio seasons tropical cyclones that have been recorded since the start of the 196970 tropical cyclone year and have reached their peak intensity to the west of 160e are included in the list the most intense tropical cyclone in the south pacific cyclone winston of 2016 is also the most intense storm in the southern hemispherestorms with an intensity of 920 hpa 27.17 inhg or less are listed storm information was less reliably documented and recorded before 1985until recently it was not known that tropical cyclones could exist in the southern atlantic however hurricane catarina in 2004 to date the only hurricane in the south atlantic brought additional review a subsequent study found that there was an average of 1-2 subtropical or tropical cyclones per year in the southern atlantic in recent decades no official database of south atlantic cyclones exists but a partial list of tropical and subtropical systems with intensity below 1000hpa 29.53inhg is listed
