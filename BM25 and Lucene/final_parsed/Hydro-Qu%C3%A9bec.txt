hydroqu bec  wikipedia hydro-qubec is a public utility that manages the generation transmission and distribution of electricity in quebecit was formed by the government of quebec in 1944 from the expropriation of private firms this was followed by massive investment in hydro-electric projects like churchill falls and the james bay project today with 63 hydroelectric power stations the combined output capacity is 36,912 megawatts extra power is exported from the province and hydro-qubec supplies 10 per cent of new englands power requirementshydro-qubec is a state-owned enterprise based in montreal in 2015 it paid cad2.36 billion in dividends to its sole shareholder the government of qubec its residential power rates are among the lowest in north americamore than 40 percent of canadas water resources are in qubec and hydro-qubec is the fourth largest hydropower producer in the worldthe company logo a stylized q fashioned out of a circle and a lightning bolt was designed by montreal-based design agency gagnonvalkus in 1960in quebec advocates for the creation of a public hydroelectric utility protested against high costs poor rural electrification and the lack of french speakers in management positions in hydroelectricity companies in 1944 montreal light heat  power company was nationalised along with its subsidiary beauharnois power and hydro-qubec was created to manage the companiesquebec premier adlard godbout adopted a policy of investing 10 million dollars per year in rural electrification however in 1944 the government changed and the new premier maurice duplessis was opposed to any form of government intervention in the economy local cooperatives were created to bring power to rural areas duplessis remained in power until 1960 and during that time there were no further nationalisations of companies and hydro-qubec mostly served the montreal areamajor projects includedbetween 1944 and 1962 hydro-qubecs installed capacity increased from 616 to 3,661 mw while lowering residential power rates by half in the montreal areaduplessis conservative reign now known as the grande noirceur ended when he died in office in 1959 the subsequent election of the quebec liberal party led by jean lesage marked the beginning of the quiet revolution a period of reform and modernisation the new government gave hydro-qubec an exclusive mandate to develop new sites in 1963 the government authorized it to acquire private electricity distributors including the gatineau power company and the shawinigan water  power company hydro-qubec achieved province-wide scope all of the 46 rural coops accepted hydro-qubecs 1963 buyout offer except saint-jean-baptiste-de-rouville which still exists major projects during this period includedbecause of the economic climate demand for electricity dropped significantly in the early 1980s which led to structural changes at hydro-qubec it became a joint stock company whose sole shareholder is qubec government to which it pays an annual dividend it was also given the mandate to export power and to work in any energy-related fieldin 1986 the quebec  new england transmission began bringing power from the james bay project 1,100 kilometers south to the boston areaphase ii of the james bay project started in 1987 and took nine years to complete construction of the denis-perron dam began in 1994in the late 90s the wholesale electricity market opened up across north america and hydro-qubec opened its transmission system and wholesale electricity market to competition both inside and outside its tranditional service area the us federal energy regulatory commission granted hydro-qubec a licence to sell wholesale electricity at market prices enabling hydro-qubec to expand its market hydro-qubec acquired a substantial share of noverco controller of natural gas distributor gaz mtro to participate in that market in northeastern north americain 2002 the agreement respecting a new relationship between the cree nation and the government of quebec between the grand council of the crees and the quebec government made possible the development of the eastmain reservoir the 5,000 million cad eastmain-1-a and sarcelle powerhouses and rupert river diversion project this will provide water power to new turbines at eastmain-1 or eastmain-1-a and sarcelle powerhouses and will provide increased flow at the existing la grande-1 generating station as well as robert-bourassa or la grande-2-a output will be 918 mwother stations commissioned since 1997 arein 1988 all of quebec and parts of new england and new brunswick lost power because of an equipment failure at a substation on the north shore the march 1989 geomagnetic storm tripped circuit breakers on the transmission network causing a nine-hour quebec-wide blackoutin the north american ice storm of 1998 five days of freezing rain collapsed 600 kilometres 370mi of high voltage power lines and over 3,000 kilometres 1,900mi of medium and low voltage distribution lines in southern quebec up to 1.4 million customers were without power for up to five weekslike its counterparts in the north american utility industry hydro-qubec was reorganized in the late 1990s to comply with electricity deregulation in the united states while still a vertically integrated company hydro-qubec has created separate business units dealing with the generation transmission and distribution aspects of the businessthe transmission division transnergie was the first to be spun off in 1997 in response to the us federal energy regulatory commissions publication of order 888 the restructuring was completed in the year 2000 with the adoption of bill 116 which amended the act respecting the rgie de lnergie to enact the functional separation of hydro-qubecs various business unitsthis functional separation and the creation of a so-called heritage pool french  of electricity echoed a recommendation of a merrill lynch study commissioned by the lucien bouchard government the january 2000 report was aimed at finding a way to deregulate the electricity market in a way that was consistent with continental trends while maintaining the quebec social pact namely low uniform and stable rates across the province particularly in the residential sectorlegislation passed in 2000 commits the generation division hydro-qubec production to provide the distribution division hydro-qubec distribution a yearly heritage pool of up to 165 twh of energy plus ancillary servicesincluding an extra 13.9 twh for losses and a guaranteed peak capacity of 34,342 mwat a set price of 2.79 per kwh order in council 1277-2001 specifies quantities to be delivered for each of the 8,760 hourly intervals which vary from 11,420 to 34,342 mwhydro-qubec distribution has to buy the remainder of the power and energy it needsapproximately 8.2 twh in 2007  by calling for tenders for long-term contracts open to all suppliers including hydro-qubec production or targeted towards suppliers of a particular energy source like wind gas power biomass or small hydro for instance hydro-qubec distribution launched calls for tenders in 2003 and 2005 for 1,000 and 2,000 mw of wind power respectively early deliveries started in 2006 and the 23 wind farms under contract should be completely on-line by december 2015the transnergie and distribution divisions remain regulated by the rgie de lnergie du qubec quebec energy board an administrative tribunal established to set retail rates for electricity and natural gas for residential commercial and industrial service in the province based on a cost-of-service approach the rgie also has extended powers including approval authority over every transmission and distribution-related capital expenditure project exceeding c10 million approval of the terms of service and of long-term supply contracts dealing with customer complaints and the setting and enforcement of safety and reliability standards for the electric gridthe generation division hydro-qubec production is not subject to regulation by the rgie however it must still submit every new construction project to a full environmental impact process including the release of extensive environmental studies the release of the studies are followed by a public hearing process conducted by the bureau daudiences publiques sur lenvironnementhydro-qubec employed 23,659 people in 2009 including 2,060 engineers making the company the largest employer of engineers in quebecfor the year ending on december 31 2011 hydro-qubec posted net earnings of c2.611 billion up 3.8% from 2010 despite lower electricity prices on export markets and the high value of the canadian dollar revenue were down 3.8% in 2011 at c12.392 billion while expenditures amounted to c7.284 billion down by c159 million from 2010 mainly due to lower short-term electricity and fuel purchases and the repeal of quebecs capital taxthe company has assets of c69.637 billion c56.901 billion of which are tangible assets its long-term debt stood at c42.05 billion and the company reported a capitalization rate of 31.0% in 2011 bonds issued by hydro-qubec are backed by the quebec government on december 31 2011 long-term securities of hydro-qubec were rated aa2 stable by moodys aa- positive by fitch ratings and a by standard  poorsin 2011 hydro-qubec paid a c1.958 billion dividend to its sole shareholder the government of quebec between 2007 and 2011 the company paid a total of c10.358 billion in dividends it took on 8b in debt during the same periodin 1981 the parti qubcois government redefined hydro-qubecs mission by modifying the terms of the social pact of 1944 the government issued itself 43,741,090 shares worth c100 each and the amended statute stated that hydro-qubec would now pay up to 75% of its net earnings in dividends this amendment to the hydro-qubec act started an episodic debate on whether hydro-qubec should be fully or partially privatized in recent years economist marcel boyer and businessman claude garciaboth associated with the conservative think tank the montreal economic institutehave often raised the issue claiming that the company could be better managed by the private sector and that the proceeds from a sale would lower public debtwithout going as far as boyer and garcia mario dumont the head of the action dmocratique du qubec briefly discussed the possibility of selling a minority stake of hydro-qubec during the 2008 election campaign a lger marketing poll conducted in november 2008 found that a majority of quebec respondents 53% were opposed to his proposal to sell 7.5% of the companys equity to quebec citizens and businesses while 38% were in favorcommenting on the issue on guy a lepages talk show former pq premier jacques parizeau estimated that such an idea would be quite unpopular in public opinion adding that hydro-qubec is often seen by quebecers as a national success story and a source of pride this could explain why various privatization proposals in the past have received little public attention the liberal government has repeatedly stated that hydro-qubec is not for salelike many other economists yvan allaire from montreals hautes tudes commerciales business school advocate increased electricity rates as a way to increase the governments annual dividend without resorting to privatization others like columnist bertrand tremblay of saguenays le quotidien claim that privatization would signal a drift to the days when quebecs natural resources were sold in bulk to foreigners at ridiculously low prices for too long tremblay writes quebec was somewhat of a banana republic almost giving away its forestry and water resources in turn those foreign interests were exporting our jobs associated with the development of our natural resources with the complicity of local vulturesleft-wing academics such as uqams lo-paul lauzon and gabriel sainte-marie have claimed that privatization would be done at the expense of residential customers who would pay much higher rates they say that privatization would also be a betrayal of the social pact between the people and its government and that the province would be short-selling itself by divesting of a choice asset for a minimal short term gainhydro-qubec sources of energy supply 2013on december 31 2013 hydro-qubec production owned and operated 61 hydro plantsincluding 12 of over a 1,000 mw capacity 26 major reservoirs these facilities are located in 13 of quebecs 430 watersheds including the saint lawrence betsiamites la grande manicouagan ottawa outardes and saint-maurice rivers these plants provide the bulk of electricity generated and sold by the companynon-hydro plants included the baseload 675-mw gross gentilly nuclear generating station a candu-design reactor which was permanently shut down on december 28 2012 the 660-mw tracy thermal generating station a heavy fuel oil-fired plant shutdown in march 2011 and two gas turbine peaker plants for a total installed capacity of 36,971 mw in 2011 hydro-qubecs average generation cost was 2.11 cents per kwh in 2011the company also purchases the bulk of the output of the 5,428-mw churchill falls generating station in labrador under a long term contract expiring in 2041 in 2009 hydro-qubec bought the 60% stake owned by abitibibowater in the mccormick plant 335 mw located at the mouth of the manicouagan river near baie-comeau for c616 millionin 2013 the energy sold by hydro-qubec to its grid-connected customers in quebec and exported to neighboring markets came almost exclusively from renewable sources hydro 96.78% is by far the largest source followed by wind 2.16% and biomass biogas and waste 0.75% the remainder came from nuclear 0.19% and thermal 0.12% generation emissions of carbon dioxide 1,130 tonnestwh sulfur dioxide 4 tonnestwh and nitrogen oxides 10 tonnestwh were between 49 and 238 times lower than the industry average in northeastern north america imported electricity bought on the markets account for most of these emissionshydro-qubecs expertise at building and operating a very high voltage electrical grid spreading over long distances has long been recognized in the electrical industry transnergie hydro-qubecs transmission division operates the largest electricity transmission network in north america it acts as the independent system operator and reliability coordinator for the qubec interconnection of the north american electric reliability corporation system and is part of the northeast power coordinating council npcc transnergie manages the flow of energy on the quebec network and ensures non-discriminatory access to all participants involved in the wholesale market the non-discriminatory access policy allows a company such as nalcor to sell some of its share of power from churchill falls on the open market in the state of new york using transnergies network upon payment of a transmission feein recent years transnergies contrle des mouvements dnergie cm unit has been acting as the reliability coordinator of the bulk electricity network for quebec as a whole under a bilateral agreement between the rgie de lnergie du qubec and the federal energy regulatory commission of the united statestransnergies high voltage network stretches over 33,630km 20,900mi including 11,422km 7,097mi of  and a network of 514 substations it is connected to neighbouring canadian provinces and the united states by 17 ties with a maximum reception capacity of 10,850 mw and a maximum transmission capacity of 7,994 mwthe transnergies network operates asynchronously from that of its neighbours on the eastern interconnection although quebec uses the same 60 hertz frequency as the rest of north america its grid does not use the same phase as surrounding networks transnergie mainly relies on back to back hvdc converters to export or import electricity from other jurisdictionsthis feature of the quebec network allowed hydro-qubec to remain unscathed during the northeast blackout of august 14 2003 with the exception of 5 hydro plants on the ottawa river radially connected to the ontario grid at the time a new 1250-mw back to back hvdc tie has been commissioned at the outaouais substation in lange-gardien near the ontario border the new interconnection has been online since 2009 and the 315 kv line is fully operational since 2010one drawback of the transnergie network involves the long distances separating the generation sites and the main consumer markets for instance the radisson substation links the james bay project plants to the nicolet station near sainte-eulalie south of the saint lawrence over 1,200 kilometres 750mi awayin 2011 transnergie invested c1.3 billion in capital expenditures including c460 million to expand its networkin addition to the new tie with ontario the company plans to build a new 1200-mw direct current link between the des cantons substation at windsor quebec in quebecs eastern townships and deerfield new hampshire with an hvdc converter terminal built at franklin new hampshire the us segment of the us1.1 billion line would be built by northern pass transmission llc a partnership between northeast utilities 75% and nstar 25% in order to go ahead the project must receive regulatory approval in quebec and the united states the proposed transmission line could be in operation in 2015 according to jim robb a senior executive from northeast utilities new england could meet one third of its regional greenhouse gas initiative commitments with the hydropower coming through this new power line alonehydro-qubec distribution is in charge of retail sales to most customers in quebec it operates a network of 112,089 kilometres 69,649mi of medium and low voltage lines the division is the sole electric distributor across the province with the exception of 9 municipal distribution networks  in alma amos baie-comeau coaticook joliette magog saguenay sherbrooke and westmountand the electric cooperative of saint-jean-baptiste de rouvillehydro-qubec distribution buys most of its power from the 165-twh heritage pool provided by hydro-qubec production at 2.79kwh the division usually purchases additional power by entering into long-term contracts after a public call for tenders for shorter term needs it also buys power from the neighboring systems at market prices as a last resort hydro-qubec production can also provide short-term relief supply contracts above and beyond the heritage pool must be approved by the rgie de lnergie du qubec and their costs are passed on to customersthe division signed one natural gas cogeneration agreement for 507 mw in 2003 three forest biomass deals 47.5 mw in 2004 and 2005 and ten contracts for wind power 2,994 mw in 2005 and 2008 all with private sector producers it also signed two flexible contracts with hydro-qubec production 600 mw in 2002hydro-qubec distribution is also responsible for the production of power in remote communities not connected to the main power grid the division operates an off-grid hydroelectric dam serving communities on the lower north shore and 23 small diesel power plants in the magdalen islands in haute-mauricie and in nunavikhydro-qubec has made significant investments in research and development over the past 40 years in addition to funding university research the company is the only electric utility in north america to operate its own large-scale research institute linstitut de recherche dhydro-qubec ireq established by lionel boulet in 1967 the research centre is located in varennes a suburb on the south shore of montreal ireq operates on an annual research budget of approximately c100 million and specializes in the areas of high voltage mechanics and thermomechanics network simulations and calibrationresearch conducted by scientists and engineers at ireq has helped to extend the life of dams improve water turbine performance automate network management and increase the transmission capacity of high voltage power linesanother research centre the laboratoire des technologies de lnergie lte in shawinigan was opened in 1988 to adapt and develop new products while helping industrial customers improve their energy efficiencyin the last 20 years the institute has also conducted research and development work towards the electrification of ground transportation current projects include battery materials including innovative work on lithium iron phosphate and nano-titanate improved electric drive trains and the effects of the large-scale deployment of electric vehicles on the power grid projects focus on technologies to increase range improve performance in cold weather and reduce charging timehydro-qubec has been criticized for not having taken advantage of some of its innovations an electric wheel motor concept that struck a chord with quebecers first prototyped in 1994 by pierre couture an engineer and physicist working at ireq is one of these the heir to the couture wheel motor is now marketed by tm4 electrodynamic systems a spin-off established in 1998 that has made deals with frances dassault and heuliez to develop an electric car the cleanova of which prototypes were built in 2006 hydro-qubec announced in early 2009 at the montreal international auto show that its engine had been chosen by tata motors to equip a demonstration version of its indica model which will be road tested in norwaythe hydro-qubec quipement division acts as the companys main contractor on major construction sites with the exception of work conducted on the territory covered by the james bay and northern quebec agreement which are assigned to the socit dnergie de la baie james subsidiarythe construction of a complex of four hydroelectric generating stations on the romaine river  began on may 13 2009 the plants are scheduled to be built and commissioned between 2014 and 2020in his march 2009 inaugural speech quebec premier jean charest announced that his government intends to further develop the provinces hydroelectric potential the call for further development of hydroelectric and other renewable generating capacity has been implemented in the companys 2009-2013 strategic plan released on july 30 2009 hydro-qubec plans capacity upgrades at the jean-lesage 120 mw and ren-lvesque 210 mw stations and a third unit at the sm-3 plant 440 mw the company will also conduct technical and environmental studies and undertake consultations with local communities to build new facilities on the petit-mcatina 1,200 mw and magpie 850 mw rivers on the north shore and revive the tabaret project 132 mw in the abitibi-tmiscamingue region in western quebechydro-qubec first forays outside its borders began in 1978 a new subsidiary hydro-qubec international was created to market the companys know-how abroad in the fields of distribution generation and transmission of electricity the new venture leveraged the existing pool of expertise in the parent companyduring the next 25 years hydro-qubec was particularly active abroad with investments in electricity transmission networks and generation transelec in chile the cross sound cable in the united states the consorcio transmantaro in peru hidroelectrica rio lajas in costa rica murraylink in australia and the fortuna generating station in panamait briefly held a 17% share in senelec senegals electric utility when the senegalese government decided to sell part of the company to a consortium led by the french company elyo a subsidiary of group suez lyonnaise des eaux in 1999 the transaction was canceled in 2000 following the election of president abdoulaye wadealso in 1999 hydro-qubec international acquired a 20% stake in the meiya power company in china for c83 million the company held this participation until july 2004 the companys expertise was sought by several hydroelectric developers throughout the world including the three gorges dam where hydros employees trained chinese engineers in the fields of management finance and damshydro-qubec gradually withdrew from the international business between 2003 and 2006 and sold off all of its foreign investments for a profit proceeds from these sales were paid to the governments generations fund a trust fund set up by the province to alleviate the effect of public debt on future generationsthe construction and operation of electric generation transmission and distribution facilities has environmental effects and hydro-qubecs activities are no exception hydroelectric development affects the natural environment where facilities are built and on the people living in the area for instance the development of new reservoirs increases the level of mercury in lakes and rivers which works up the food chain it temporarily increases the emission of greenhouse gases from reservoirs and contributes to shoreline erosionin addition hydroelectric facilities transform the human environment they create new obstacles to navigation flood traditional hunting and trapping grounds force people to change their eating habits due to the elevated mercury content of some species of fish destroy invaluable artifacts that would help trace the human presence on the territory and disrupt the society and culture of aboriginal people living near the facilitiessince the early 1970s hydro-qubec has been aware of the environmental externalities of its operations the adoption of a quebec statute on environmental quality in 1972 the cancellation of champigny project a planned pumped storage plant in the jacques-cartier river valley in 1973 and the james bay negotiations leading to the james bay and northern quebec agreement in 1975 forced the company to reconsider its practicesto address environmental concerns hydro-qubec established an environmental protection committee in 1970 and an environmental management unit in september 1973 its mandate is to study and measure the environmental effects of the company prepare impact assessment and develop mitigation strategies for new and existing facilities while conducting research projects in these areas in cooperation with the scientific communityin the late 1970s the company set up a network of 27 monitoring stations to measure the effects of the james bay project which provide a wealth of data on northern environments the first 30 years of studies in the james bay area have confirmed that mercury levels in fish increase by 3 to 6 times over the first 5 to 10 years after the flooding of a reservoir but then gradually revert to their initial values after 20 to 30 years these results confirm similar studies conducted elsewhere in canada the united states and finland research also found that it is possible to reduce human exposure to mercury even when fish constitutes a significant part of a populations diet exposure risks can be mitigated without overly reducing the consumption of fish simply by avoiding certain species and fishing spotsdespite the fact that the transformation of a terrestrial environment into an aquatic environment constitutes a major change and that flooding leads to the displacement or death of nonmigratory animals the riparian environments lost through flooding are partially replaced by new ones on the exposed banks of reduced-flow rivers the biological diversity of reservoir islands is comparable to other islands in the area and the reservoir drawdown zone is used by a variety of wildlife the population of migratory species of interest such as the caribou have even increased to the point where the hunt has been expandedemissions of greenhouse gases ghg rise significantly for a few years after reservoir impoundment and then stabilize after 10 years to a level similar to that of surrounding lakes gross ghg emissions of reservoirs in the james bay area fluctuate around 30,000 tonnes of co2 equivalent per twh of generated power hydro-qubec claims its hydroelectric plants release 35 times less ghg than comparable gas-fired plants and 70 times less than coal-fired ones and that they constitute the option with the best performance overallanother major environmental concern relates to the population of areas affected by hydroelectric development specifically the innu of the north shore and the cree and inuit in northern quebec the hydroelectric developments of the last quarter of the 20th century have accelerated the settling process among aboriginal populations that started in the 1950s among the reasons cited for the increased adoption of a sedentary lifestyle among these peoples are the establishment of aboriginal businesses the introduction of paid labor and the flooding of traditional trapping and fishing lands by the new reservoirs along with the operation of social and education services run by the communities themselves under the james bay and northern quebec agreementsome native communities particularly the crees have come to a point where they increasingly resemble the industrialized society of the south notes an hydro-qubec report summarizing the research conducted in the area between 1970 and 2000 the report adds that a similar phenomenon was observed after the construction of roads and hydroelectric plants near isolated communities in northern canada and scandinavia however growing social problems and rising unemployment have followed the end of the large construction projects in the 1990s the report concludes that future economic and social development in the area will largely depend on the desire for cooperation among the various playersafter the strong rejection of the surot project and its subsequent cancellation in november 2004 hydro-qubec under the leadership of its new ceo thierry vandal reaffirmed hydro-qubecs commitment towards energy efficiency hydropower and development of alternative energy since then hydro-qubec regularly stresses three criteria for any new hydroelectric development undertaken by the company projects must be cost effective environmentally acceptable and well received by the communities hydro-qubec has also taken part in a series of sustainable development initiatives since the late 1980s its approach is based on three principles economic development social development and environmental protection since 2007 the company adheres to the global reporting initiative which governs the collection and publication of sustainability performance information the company employs 250 professionals and managers in the environmental field and has implemented an iso 14001-certified environmental management systemat the end of 2010 hydro-qubec served 4,060,195 customers grouped into three broad categories residential and farm d rate commercial and institutional g rate and industrial m and l rates the other category includes public lighting systems and municipal distribution systemsabout a dozen distribution rates are set annually by the rgie de lnergie after public hearings pricing is based on the cost of delivery which includes the cost of supply and transmission depreciation on fixed assets and provisions for the maintenance of facilities customer growth and a profit marginrates are uniform throughout quebec and are based on consumer type and volume of consumption all rates vary in block to mitigate any cross-subsidization effect between residential commercial and industrial customershydro-qubec retail rates are among the lowest in north america after a five-year rate freeze between may 1 1998 and january 1 2004 the rgie granted rate increases on 8 occasions between 2004 and 2010 for a total of 18.4% more recently the regulator ordered two successive rate rollbacks in 2011 0.4% and 2012 0.5% however rates are expected to go up by 3.7% a year from 2014 to 2018 to reflect a gradual increase of heritage pool electricity announced in the 2010 quebec budgetthe average consumption of residential and agricultural customers is relatively high at 16,857 kwh per year in 2011 because of the widespread use of electricity as the main source of space 77% and water heating 90% hydro-qubec estimates that heating accounts for more than one half of the electricity demand in the residential sectorthis preference for electric heating makes electricity demand more unpredictable but offers some environmental benefits despite quebecs very cold climate in winter greenhouse gases emissions in the residential sector accounted for only 5.5% 4.65 mt  eq of all emissions in quebec in 2006 emissions from the residential sector in quebec fell by 30% between 1990 and 2006residential use of electricity fluctuates from one year to another and is strongly correlated with the weather contrary to the trend in neighboring networks hydro-qubecs system is winter-peaking a new all-time consumption record was set on january 23 2013 with a load of  previous records were established on january 24 2011 with  on january 16 2009 with a load of  and on january 15 2004 when peak reached the price of electricity for residences and farms includes a 40.64 daily subscription fee and two price levels depending on consumption the rates are all-included power transmission and distribution costs but are subject to the goods and services tax gst and the quebec sales tax qst as of april 1 2012 customers pay 5.32kwh for the first 30 daily kwh while the remainder is sold at 7.51kwh the average monthly bill for a residential customer was approximately c100 in 2008electric meter readings are usually conducted every two months and bills are bimonthly however the company offers an optional equalized payment plan allowing residential customers to pay their annual electricity costs in 12 monthly installments based on past consumption patterns of the current customer address and the average temperature in that locationin 2007 hydro-qubec pulled out of a canadian government initiative to install smart meters across the province stating that it would be too costly to deliver real savings since then hydro-qubec organized a 2-year pilot project involving 2,000 customers in 4 cities with time of use metering a report filed with the rgie de lnergie in the summer of 2010 concluded that the effect of marginal cost pricing with three levels of pricing in the winter would lead to minimal load and energy savings the company intends to gradually phase-in advanced metering infrastructure ami between 2011 and 2017 early efforts will focus on meter data transfer connect-disconnect outage detection and theft reductionfor more than a century industrial development in quebec has been stimulated by the abundance of hydroelectric resources energy represents a significant expenditure in the pulp and paper and aluminum sectors two industries with long-standing traditions in quebec in 2010 industrial customers purchased 68.4 twh from hydro-qubec representing 40.4% of all electricity sold by the company on the domestic marketthe quebec government uses low electricity rates to attract new business and consolidate existing jobs despite its statutory obligation to sell electric power to every person who so requests the province has reserved the right to grant large load allocations to companies on a case by case basis since 1974 the threshold was set at 175 mw from 1987 to 2006 and was reduced to 50 mw in the governments 20062015 energy strategylarge industrial users pay a lower rate than the domestic and commercial customers because of lower distribution costs in 2010 the largest industrial users the rate l customers were paying an average of 4.66kwh whereas companies with special contracts paid 3.07kwhin 1987 hydro-qubec and the quebec government agreed to a series of controversial deals with aluminum giants alcan and alcoa these risk sharing contracts set the price of electricity based on a series of factors including aluminum world prices and the value of the canadian dollar those agreements are gradually being replaced by one based on published rateson may 10 2007 the quebec government signed an agreement with alcan the agreement which is still in force despite the companys merger with rio tinto group renews the water rights concession on the saguenay and peribonka rivers in exchange alcan has agreed to invest in its quebec facilities and to maintain jobs and its corporate headquarters in montrealon december 19 2008 hydro-qubec and alcoa signed a similar agreement this agreement which expires in 2040 maintains the provision of electricity to alcoas three aluminum smelters in the province located in
