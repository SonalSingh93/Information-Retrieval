united states navy  wikipedia us department of defensethe united states navy usn is the naval warfare service branch of the united states armed forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the united states the us navy is the largest and most capable navy in the world with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage the us navy has the worlds largest aircraft carrier fleet with eleven in service one in the reserve fleet and two new carriers under construction with 322,421 personnel on active duty and 107,577 in the navy reserve the navy is the third largest of the service branches it has 276 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 operational aircraft as of june 2017the us navy traces its origins to the continental navy which was established during the american revolutionary war and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter the us navy played a major role in the american civil war by blockading the confederacy and seizing control of its rivers it played the central role in the world war ii defeat of imperial japan the 21st century us navy maintains a sizable global presence deploying in strength in such areas as the western pacific the mediterranean and the indian ocean it is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises making it a frequent actor in us foreign and military policythe navy is administratively managed by the department of the navy which is headed by the civilian secretary of the navy the department of the navy is itself a division of the department of defense which is headed by the secretary of defense the chief of naval operations cno is the most senior naval officer serving in the department of the navythe mission of the navy is to maintain train and equip combat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seasthe us navy is a seaborne branch of the military of the united states the navys three primary areas of responsibilityus navy training manuals state that the mission of the us armed forces is to prepare and conduct prompt and sustained combat operations in support of the national interest as part of that establishment the us navys functions comprise sea control power projection and nuclear deterrence in addition to sealift dutiesit follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive and with it everything honorable and gloriousthe navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition which produced a large community of sailors captains and shipbuilders in the early stages of the american revolutionary war massachusetts had its own massachusetts naval militia the rationale for establishing a national navy was debated in the second continental congress supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping defend the coast and make it easier to seek out support from foreign countries detractors countered that challenging the british royal navy then the worlds preeminent naval power was a foolish undertaking commander in chief george washington resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going schooner uss hannah to interdict british merchant ships and reported the captures to the congress on 13 october 1775 the continental congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against british merchant ships this resolution created the continental navy and is considered the first establishment of the us navy the continental navy achieved mixed results it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many british merchant vessels but it lost twenty-four of its vessels and at one point was reduced to two in active service in august 1785 after the revolutionary war had drawn to a close congress had sold alliance the last ship remaining in the continental navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navyin 1972 the chief of naval operations admiral elmo zumwalt authorized the navy to celebrate its birthday on 13 october to honor the establishment of the continental navy in 1775the united states was without a navy for nearly a decade a state of affairs that exposed us maritime merchant ships to a series of attacks by the barbary pirates the sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the us navys first warships in 1797 was the us revenue cutter service usrcs the primary predecessor of the us coast guard although the usrcs conducted operations against the pirates their depredations far outstripped its abilities and congress passed the naval act of 1794 that established a permanent standing navy on 27 march 1794 the naval act ordered the construction and manning of six frigates and by october 1797 the first three were brought into service ussunited states ussconstellation and ussconstitution due to his strong posture on having a strong standing navy during this period john adams is often called the father of the american navy in 179899 the navy was involved in an undeclared quasi-war with france from 1801 to 1805 in the first barbary war the us navy defended us ships from the barbary pirates blockaded the barbary ports and executed attacks against the barbary fleetsthe us navy saw substantial action in the war of 1812 where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the royal navy it drove all significant british forces off lake erie and lake champlain and prevented them from becoming british-controlled zones the result was a major defeat for the british invasion of new york state and the defeat of the military threat from the native american allies of the british despite this the us navy was unable to prevent the british from blockading its ports and landing troops after the war the us navy again focused its attention on protecting american shipping assets sending squadrons to the caribbean the mediterranean where it participated in the second barbary war that ended piracy in the region south america africa and the pacific from 1819 to the outbreak of the civil war the africa squadron operated to suppress the slave trade seizing 36 slave ships although its contribution was smaller than that of the much larger british royal navyduring the mexicanamerican war the us navy blockaded mexican ports capturing or burning the mexican fleet in the gulf of california and capturing all major cities in baja california peninsula in 18461848 the navy successfully used the pacific squadron under commodore robert stockton and its marines and blue-jackets to facilitate the capture of california with large scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the california battalion the navy conducted the us militarys first large-scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at veracruz mexico when larger guns were needed to bombard veracruz navy volunteers landed large guns and manned them in the successful bombardment and capture of the city this successful landing and capture of veracruz opened the way for the capture of mexico city and the end of the war the us navy established itself as a player in united states foreign policy through the actions of commodore matthew perry in japan which resulted in the convention of kanagawa in 1854naval power played a significant role during the american civil war in which the union had a distinct advantage over the confederacy on the seas a union blockade on all major ports shut down exports and the coastal trade but blockade runners mostly owned and operated by british companies provided a thin lifeline the brown-water navys control of the river systems made internal travel difficult for confederates and easy for the union the war saw ironclad warships in combat for the first time at the battle of hampton roads in 1862 which pitted ussmonitor against cssvirginia for two decades after the war however the us navys fleet was neglected and became technologically obsoleteour ships are our natural bulwarksa modernization program beginning in the 1880s when the first steel hulled warships stimulated the american steel industry and the new steel navy was born this rapid expansion of the us navy and its easy victory over the spanish navy in 1898 brought a new respect for american technical quality rapid building of at first pre-dreadnoughts then dreadnoughts brought the us in line with the navies of countries such as britain and germany in 1907 most of the navys battleships with several support vessels dubbed the great white fleet were showcased in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world ordered by president theodore roosevelt it was a mission designed to demonstrate the navys capability to extend to the global theater by 1911 the us had begun building the super-dreadnoughts at a pace to eventually become competitive with britainthe us navy saw little action during world war i it concentrated on mine laying operations against german u-boats hesitation by the senior command meant that naval forces were not contributed until late 1917 battleship division nine was dispatched to britain and served as the sixth battle squadron of the british grand fleet its presence allowed the british to decommission some older ships and reuse the crews on smaller vessels destroyers and us naval air force units contributed to the anti-submarine operations the strength of the united states navy grew under an ambitious ship building program associated with the naval act of 1916naval construction especially of battleships was limited by the washington naval conference of 192122 the aircraft carriers usssaratogacv-3 and usslexingtoncv-2 were built on the hulls of partially built battle cruisers that had been canceled by the treaty the new deal used public works administration funds to build warships such as ussyorktowncv-5 and ussenterprisecv-6 by 1936 with the completion of usswaspcv-7 the us navy possessed a carrier fleet of 165,000 tonnes displacement although this figure was nominally recorded as 135,000 tonnes to comply with treaty limitations franklin roosevelt the number two official in the navy department during world war i appreciated the navy and gave it strong support in return senior leaders were eager for innovation and experimented with new technologies such as magnetic torpedoes and developed a strategy called war plan orange for victory in the pacific in a hypothetical war with japan that would eventually become realitythe us navy grew into a formidable force in the years prior to world war ii with battleship production being restarted in 1937 commencing with ussnorth carolinabb-55 though ultimately unsuccessful japan attempted to neutralize this strategic threat with the surprise attack on pearl harbor on 7 december 1941 following american entry into the war the us navy grew tremendously as the united states was faced with a two-front war on the seas it achieved notable acclaim in the pacific theater where it was instrumental to the allies successful island hopping campaign the us navy participated in many significant battles including the battle of the coral sea the battle of midway the solomon islands campaign the battle of the philippine sea the battle of leyte gulf and the battle of okinawa by wars end in 1945 the us navy had added hundreds of new ships including 18 aircraft carriers and 8 battleships and had over 70% of the worlds total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1,000 tons or greater at its peak the us navy was operating 6,768 ships on v-j day in august 1945doctrine had significantly shifted by the end of the war the us navy had followed in the footsteps of the navies of great britain and germany which favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons the development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating utilization by the japanese against the us at pearl harbor however shifted us thinking the pearl harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of us navy battleships this placed much of the burden of retaliating against the japanese on the small number of aircraft carriersthe potential for armed conflict with the soviet union during the cold war pushed the us navy to continue its technological advancement by developing new weapons systems ships and aircraft us naval strategy changed to that of forward deployment in support of us allies with an emphasis on carrier battle groupsthe navy was a major participant in the vietnam war blockaded cuba during the cuban missile crisis and through the use of ballistic missile submarines became an important aspect of the united states nuclear strategic deterrence policy the us navy conducted various combat operations in the persian gulf against iran in 1987 and 1988 most notably operation praying mantis the navy was extensively involved in operation urgent fury operation desert shield operation desert storm operation deliberate force operation allied force operation desert fox and operation southern watchthe us navy has also been involved in search and rescuesearch and salvage operations sometimes in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with us coast guard ships two examples are the 1966 palomares b-52 crash incident and search for the nuclear bombs and task force 71 of the seventh fleet operation in search for korean air lines flight 007 shot down by the soviets on 1 september 1983when a crisis confronts the nation the first question often asked by policymakers is what naval forces are available and how fast can they be on stationthe us navy continues to be a major support to us interests in the 21st century since the end of the cold war it has shifted its focus from preparations for large-scale war with the soviet union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts the navy participated in operation enduring freedom operation iraqi freedom and is a major participant in the ongoing war on terror largely in this capacity development continues on new ships and weapons including the gerald r ford-class aircraft carrier and the littoral combat ship because of its size weapons technology and ability to project force far from us shores the current us navy remains a potent asset for the united states moreover it is the principal means through which the us maintains international global order namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nationsin 2007 the us navy joined with the us marine corps and us coast guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called a cooperative strategy for 21st century seapower that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war the strategy was presented by the chief of naval operations the commandant of the marine corps and commandant of the coast guard at the international sea power symposium in newport ri on 17 october 2007 the strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crisesman-made or naturalcan adversely impact the us economy and quality of life this new strategy charts a course for the navy coast guard and marine corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to prevent negative impacts on the usin 2010 chief of naval operations admiral gary roughead noted that demands on the navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future the us navy must rely even more on international partnershipsin its 2013 budget request the navy focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the ssbn replacement by the next year the usn found itself unable to maintain eleven aircraft carriers in the face of the expiration of budget relief offered by the bipartisan budget act of 2013 and cno jonathan greenert said that a ten ship carrier fleet would not be able to sustainably support military requirements the british first sea lord george zambellas said that  the usn had switched from outcome-led to resource-led planningone significant change in us policymaking that is having a major effect on naval planning is the pivot to east asia in response this secretary of the navy ray mabus has stated that 60 percent of the total us fleet will be deployed to the pacific by the year 2020 the navys most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan published in 2016 calls for a future fleet of 350 ships in order to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international environmentus navy officers aboard the aircraft carrier uss abraham lincoln cvn-72 monitor defense systems during early 2010s

department of the navy under civilian leadership of the secretary of the navy secnav the most senior naval officer is the chief of naval operations cno a four-star admiral who is immediately under and reports to the secretary of the navy at the same time the chief of naval operations is one of the joint chiefs of staff which is the second-highest deliberatory body of the armed forces after the united states national security council although it only plays an advisory role to the president and does not nominally form part of the chain of command the secretary of the navy and chief of naval operations are responsible for organizing recruiting training and equipping the navy so that it is ready for operation under the command of the unified combat command commandersthere are nine components in the operating forces of the us navy the united states fleet forces command formerly united states atlantic fleet united states pacific fleet united states naval forces central command united states naval forces europe naval network warfare command navy reserve united states naval special warfare command operational test and evaluation force and military sealift command fleet forces command controls a number of unique capabilities including military sealift command naval expeditionary combat command and navy cyber forcesthe united states navy has six active numbered fleets third fifth sixth seventh fleet and tenth fleets are each led by a vice admiral and the fourth fleet is led by a rear admiral these six fleets are further grouped under fleet forces command the former atlantic fleet pacific fleet naval forces europe-africa and naval forces central command whose commander also doubles as commander fifth fleet the first three commands being led by four-star admirals the united states first fleet existed after the second world war from 1947 but it was redesignated the third fleet in early 1973 in early 2008 the navy reactivated the united states fourth fleet to control operations in the area controlled by southern command which consists of us assets in and around central and south americashore establishments exist to support the mission of the fleet through the use of facilities on land among the commands of the shore establishment as of april 2011 are the naval education and training command the naval meteorology and oceanography command the space and naval warfare systems command the naval facilities engineering command the naval supply systems command the naval air systems command the naval sea systems command the bureau of medicine and surgery the bureau of naval personnel the united states naval academy the naval safety center the naval strike and air warfare center and the united states naval observatory official navy websites list the office of the chief of naval operations and the chief of naval operations as part of the shore establishment but these two entities effectively sit superior to the other organizations playing a coordinating rolein 1834 the united states marine corps came under the department of the navy historically the navy has had a unique relationship with the usmc partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations together the navy and marine corps form the department of the navy and report to the secretary of the navy however the marine corps is a distinct separate service branch with its own uniformed service chief  the commandant of the marine corps a four-star generalthe marine corps depends on the navy for medical support dentists doctors nurses medical technicians known as corpsmen and religious support chaplains thus navy officers and enlisted sailors fulfill these roles when attached to marine corps units deployed to an operational environment they generally wear marine camouflage uniforms but otherwise they wear navy dress uniforms unless they opt to conform to marine corps grooming standardsin the operational environment as an expeditionary force specializing in amphibious operations marines often embark on navy ships to conduct operations from beyond territorial waters marine units deploying as part of a marine air-ground task force magtf operate under the command of the existing marine chain of command although marine units routinely operate from amphibious assault ships the relationship has evolved over the years much as the commander of the carrier air groupwing cag does not work for the carrier commanding officer but coordinates with the ships co and staff some marine aviation squadrons usually fixed-wing assigned to carrier air wings train and operate alongside navy squadrons they fly similar missions and often fly sorties together under the cognizance of the cag aviation is where the navy and marines share the most common ground since aircrews are guided in their use of aircraft by standard procedures outlined in series of publications known as natops manualsthe united states coast guard in its peacetime role with the department of homeland security fulfills its law enforcement and rescue role in the maritime environment it provides law enforcement detachments ledets to navy vessels where they perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during naval boarding and interdiction missions in times of war the coast guard operates as a service in the navy at other times coast guard port security units are sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets the coast guard also jointly staffs the navys naval coastal warfare groups and squadrons the latter of which were known as harbor defense commands until late-2004 which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areasthe united states navy has nearly 500,000 personnel approximately a quarter of whom are in ready reserve of those on active duty more than eighty percent are enlisted sailors and around fifteen percent are commissioned officers the rest are midshipmen of the united states naval academy and midshipmen of the naval reserve officer training corps at over 180 universities around the country and officer candidates at the navys officer candidate schoolenlisted sailors complete basic military training at boot camp and then are sent to complete training for their individual careerssailors prove they have mastered skills and deserve responsibilities by completing personnel qualification standards pqs tasks and examinations among the most important is the warfare qualification which denotes a journeyman level of capability in surface warfare aviation warfare information dominance warfare naval aircrew special warfare seabee warfare submarine warfare or expeditionary warfare many qualifications are denoted on a sailors uniform with us navy badges and insigniathe uniforms of the us navy have evolved gradually since the first uniform regulations for officers were issued in 1802 on the formation of the navy department the predominant colors of us navy uniforms are navy blue and white us navy uniforms were based on royal navy uniforms of the time and have tended to follow that templatethe commissioned officer ranks of the us navy are divided into three categories junior officers senior officers and flag officers junior officers are those officers in pay grades o-1 to o-4 while senior officers are those in pay grades o-5 and o-6 and flag officers are those in pay grades of o-7 and abovesailors in pay grades e-1 through e-3 are considered to be in apprenticeships they are divided into five definable groups with colored group rate marks designating the group to which they belong seaman fireman airman constructionman and hospitalman e-4 to e-6 are non-commissioned officers ncos and are specifically called petty officers in the navy petty officers perform not only the duties of their specific career field but also serve as leaders to junior enlisted personnel e-7 to e-9 are still considered petty officers but are considered a separate community within the navy they have separate berthing and dining facilities where feasible wear separate uniforms and perform separate dutiesafter attaining the rate of master chief petty officer a service member may choose to further his or her career by becoming a command master chief petty officer cmc a cmc is considered to be the senior-most enlisted service member within a command and is the special assistant to the commanding officer in all matters pertaining to the health welfare job satisfaction morale utilization advancement and training of the commands enlisted personnel cmcs can be command level within a single unit such as a ship or shore station fleet level squadrons consisting of multiple operational units headed by a flag officer or commodore or force level consisting of a separate community within the navy such as subsurface air reservescmc insignia are similar to the insignia for master chief except that the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating ie mmcm to cmdcm the stars for command master chief are silver while stars for fleet or force master chief are gold additionally cmcs wear a badge worn on their left breast pocket denoting their title commandfleetforceinsignia and badges of the united states navy are military badges issued by the united states department of the navy to naval service members who achieve certain qualifications and accomplishments while serving on both active and reserve duty in the united states navy most naval aviation insignia are also permitted for wear on uniforms of the united states marine corpsas described in chapter 5 of us navy uniform regulations badges are categorized as breast insignia usually worn immediately above and below ribbons and identification badges usually worn at breast pocket level breast insignia are further divided between command and warfare and other qualificationinsignia come in the form of metal pin-on devices worn on formal uniforms and embroidered tape strips worn on work uniforms for the purpose of this article the general term insignia shall be used to describe both as it is done in navy uniform regulations the term badge although used ambiguously in other military branches and in informal speak to describe any pin patch or tab is exclusive to identification badges and authorized marksmanship awards according to the language in navy uniform regulations chapter 5 below are just a few of the many badges maintained by the navy the rest can be seen in the article cited at the top of this sectionnaval aviator badgesubmarine officer and enlistedsurface warfare officer insigniathe size complexity and international presence of the united states navy requires a large number of navy installations to support its operations while the majority of bases are located inside the united states itself the navy maintains a significant number of facilities abroad either in us-controlled

75,200 buildings on 3,300,000 acres 13,000km in addition the navy has more than one hundred vessels operated by the military sealift command msc crewed by a combination of civilian contractors and a small number of uniformed naval personnelthe names of commissioned ships of the us navy are prefixed with the letters uss designating united states ship non-commissioned civilian-manned vessels of the navy have names that begin with usns standing for united states naval ship the names of ships are officially selected by the secretary of the navy often to honor important people or places additionally each ship is given a letter-based hull classification symbol for example cvn or ddg to indicate the vessels type and number all ships in the navy inventory are placed in the naval vessel register which is part of the navy list required by article 29 of the united nations convention on the law of the sea the register tracks data such as the current status of a ship the date of its commissioning and the date of its decommissioning vessels that are removed from the register prior to disposal are said to be stricken from the register the navy also maintains a reserve fleet of inactive vessels that are maintained for reactivation in times of needthe us navy was one of the first to install nuclear reactors aboard naval vessels today nuclear energy powers all active us aircraft carriers and submarines in the case of the nimitz-class carrier two naval reactors give the ship almost unlimited range and provide enough electrical energy to power a city of 100,000 people the us navy previously operated nuclear-powered cruisers but all have been decommissionedthe us navy had identified a need for 313 combat ships in early 2010s but under its plans at the time could only afford 232 to 243 in march 2014 the navy started counting self-deployable support ships such as minesweepers surveillance craft and tugs in the battle fleet in order to reach a count of 272 as of october 2016 and it includes ships that have been put in shrink wrapan aircraft carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels forming a carrier strike group the supporting ships which usually include three or four aegis-equipped cruisers and destroyers a frigate and two attack submarines are tasked with protecting the carrier from air missile sea and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves ready logistics support for the group is provided by a combined ammunition oiler and supply ship modern carriers are named after american admirals and politicians usually presidentsthe navy has a statutory requirement for a minimum of 11 aircraft carriers currently there are 10 that are deployable and one the ussgerald r fordcvn-78 is currently undergoing extensive systems and technologies testing until around 2021amphibious assault ships are the centerpieces of us amphibious warfare and fulfill the same power projection role as aircraft carriers except that their striking force centers on land forces instead of aircraft they deliver command coordinate and fully support all elements of a 2,200-strong marine expeditionary unit in an amphibious assault using both air and amphibious vehicles resembling small aircraft carriers amphibious assault ships are capable of vstol stovl vtol tiltrotor and rotary wing aircraft operations they also contain a well deck to support the use of landing craft air cushion lcac and other amphibious assault watercraft recently amphibious assault ships have begun to be deployed as the core of an expeditionary strike group which usually consists of an additional amphibious transport dock and dock landing ship for amphibious warfare and an aegis-equipped cruiser and destroyer frigate and attack submarine for group defense amphibious assault ships are typically named after world war ii aircraft carriersamphibious transport docks are warships that embark transport and land marines supplies and equipment in a supporting role during amphibious warfare missions with a landing platform amphibious transport docks also have the capability to serve as secondary aviation support for an expeditionary group all amphibious transport docks can operate helicopters lcacs and other conventional amphibious vehicles while the newer san antonio class of ships has been explicitly designed to operate all three elements of the marines mobility triad expeditionary fighting vehicles efvs the v-22 osprey tiltrotor aircraft and lcacs amphibious transport docks are named after us cities with the exception of the ussjohn p murthalpd-26 named after a former congressman and usmc officer and ussmesa verdelpd-19 named for mesa verde national park in coloradothe dock landing ship is a medium amphibious transport that is designed specifically to support and operate lcacs though it is able to operate other amphibious assault vehicles in the united states inventory as well dock landing ships are normally deployed as a component of an expeditionary strike groups amphibious assault contingent operating as a secondary launch platform for lcacs all dock landing ships are named after cities or important places in us and us naval historycruisers are large surface combat vessels that conduct anti-airanti-missile warfare surface warfare anti-submarine warfare and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the anti-ship missile threat facing the united states navy this led to the development of the anspy-1 phased array radar and the standard missile with the aegis combat system coordinating the two ticonderoga-class cruisers were the first to be equipped with aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force protection role later developments of vertical launch systems and the tomahawk missile gave cruisers additional long-range land and sea strike capability making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle operations the ticonderoga class is the only active class of cruiser all cruisers in this class are named after battlesdestroyers are multi-mission medium surface ships capable of sustained performance in anti-air anti-submarine anti-ship and offensive strike operations like cruisers guided missile destroyers are primarily focused on surface strikes using tomahawk missiles and fleet defense through aegis and the standard missile destroyers additionally specialize in anti-submarine warfare and are equipped with vla rockets and lamps mk iii sea hawk helicopters to deal with underwater threats when deployed with a carrier strike group or expeditionary strike group destroyers and their fellow aegis-equipped cruisers are primarily tasked with defending the fleet while providing secondary strike capabilities with very few exceptions destroyers are named after us navy marine corps and coast guard heroesmodern us frigates mainly perform anti-submarine warfare for carrier and expeditionary strike groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping they are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments using torpedoes and lamps helicopters independently frigates are able to conduct counterdrug missions and other maritime interception operations as in the case of destroyers frigates are named after us navy marine corps and coast guard heroes as of autumn 2015 the us navy has retired its most recent class of frigates and expects that by 2020 the littoral combat ships lcs will assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet the lcs is a class of relatively small surface vessels intended for operations in the littoral zone close to shore it was envisioned to be a networked agile stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating anti-access and asymmetric threats in the littorals they have the capabilities of a small assault transport including a flight deck and hangar for housing two helicopters a stern ramp for operating small boats and the cargo volume and payload to deliver a small assault force with fighting vehicles to a roll-onroll-off port facility the ship is easy to reconfigure for different roles including anti-submarine warfare mine countermeasures anti-surface warfare intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance homeland defense maritime intercept special operations and logistics all by swapping mission-specific modules as needed the lcs program is still relatively new as of 2015 with only a few active ships but the navy has announced plans for up to 32 ships see list of littoral combat ships the navy has announced that a further 20 vessels to be built after that will be redesignated as frigatesmine countermeasures vessels are a combination of minehunters a naval vessel that actively detects and destroys individual naval mines and minesweepers which clear mined areas as a whole without prior detection of the mines the navy has approximately a dozen of these in active service but the mine countermeasure mcm role is also being assumed by the incoming classes of littoral combat ships mcm vessels have mostly legacy names of previous us navy ships especially wwii-era minesweepersa patrol boat is a relatively small naval vessel generally designed for coastal defense duties there have been many designs for patrol boats though the navy currently only has a single class they may be operated by a nations navy or coast guard and may be intended for marine blue water andor estuarine or river brown water environments the navy has approximately a dozen in active service which are mainly used in the littoral regions of the persian gulf but have also been used for home port patrols and drug interdiction missions the navys current class of patrol boats have names based on weather phenomenaall current and planned us navy submarines are nuclear-powered as only nuclear propulsion allows for the combination of stealth and long duration high-speed sustained underwater movement that makes modern nuclear submarines so vital to a modern blue-water navy the us navy operates three types ballistic missile submarines guided missile submarines and attack submarines us navy nuclear ballistic missile submarines carry the stealthiest leg of the us strategic triad the other legs are the land-based us strategic missile force and the air-based us strategic bomber force these submarines have only one mission to carry and if called upon to launch the trident nuclear missile the primary missions of attack and guided missile submarines in the us navy are peacetime engagement surveillance and intelligence special operations precision strikes and control of the seas to these attack submarines also add the battlegroup operations mission attack and guided missile submarines have several tactical missions including sinking ships and other subs launching cruise missiles gathering intelligence and assisting in special operationsas with other classes of naval vessels most us submarines or boats are named according to specific conventions the boats of the current us ballistic missile submarine class ohio-class are named after us states as the four current us guided missile submarines are converted ohio-class boats they have retained their us state names the members of the oldest currently-commissioned attack submarine class the los angelesclass are typically named for cities the follow-on seawolf-class three submarinesseawolf connecticut and jimmy cartershare no consistent naming scheme with the current virginia-class class attack submarines the us navy has extended the ohio class state-based naming scheme to these submarines attack submarines prior to the los angeles class were named for denizens of the deep while pre-ohio-class ballistic missile submarines were named for famous americans and foreigners with notable connections to the united statescarrier-based aircraft are able to strike air sea and land targets far from a carrier strike group while protecting friendly forces from enemy aircraft ships and submarines in peacetime aircrafts ability to project the threat of sustained attack from a mobile platform on the seas gives united states leaders significant diplomatic and crisis-management options aircraft additionally provide logistics support to maintain the navys readiness and through helicopters supply platforms with which to conduct search and rescue special operations anti-submarine warfare asw and anti-surface warfare asuwthe us navy began to research the use of aircraft at sea in the 1910s with lieutenant theodore g spuds ellyson becoming the first naval aviator on 28 january 1911 and commissioned its first aircraft carrier usslangleycv-1 in 1922 united states naval aviation fully came of age in world war ii when it became clear following the attack on pearl harbor the battle of the coral sea and the battle of midway that aircraft carriers and the planes that they carried had replaced the battleship as the greatest weapon on the seas leading navy aircraft in world war ii included the grumman f4f wildcat the grumman f6f hellcat the chance vought f4u corsair the douglas sbd dauntless and the grumman tbf avenger navy aircraft also played a significant role in conflicts during the following cold war years with the f-4 phantom ii and the f-14 tomcat becoming military icons of the era the navys current primary fighter and attack airplanes are the multi-mission fa-18cd hornet and its newer cousin the fa-18ef super hornet the f-35 lightning ii is presently under development and was scheduled to replace the c and d versions of the hornet beginning in 2012 initial operational capability of the f-35c is now expected to be february 2019 the navy is also looking to eventually replace its fa-18ef super hornets with the fa-xx programthe aircraft investment plan sees naval aviation growing from 30 percent of current aviation forces to half of all procurement funding over the next three decadescurrent us navy shipboard weapons systems are almost entirely focused on missiles both as a weapon and as a threat in an offensive role missiles are intended to strike targets at long distances with accuracy and precision because they are unmanned weapons missiles allow for attacks on heavily defended targets without risk to human pilots land strikes are the domain of the bgm-109 tomahawk which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities for anti-ship strikes the navys dedicated missile is the harpoon missile to defend against enemy missile attack the navy operates a number of systems that are all coordinated by the aegis combat system medium-long range defense is provided by the standard missile 2 which has been deployed since the 1980s the standard missile doubles as the primary shipboard anti-aircraft weapon and is undergoing development for use in theater ballistic missile defense short range defense against missiles is provided by the phalanx ciws and the more recently developed rim-162 evolved sea sparrow missile in addition to missiles the navy employs mark 46 and mark 50 torpedoes and various types of naval minesnaval fixed-wing aircraft employ much of the same weapons as the united states air force for both air-to-air and air-to-surface combat air engagements are handled by the heat-seeking sidewinder and the radar guided amraam missiles along with the m61 vulcan cannon for close range dogfighting for surface strikes navy aircraft utilize a combination of missiles smart bombs and dumb bombs on the list of available missiles are the maverick slam-er and jsow smart bombs include the gps-guided jdam and the laser-guided paveway series unguided munitions such as dumb bombs and cluster bombs make up the rest of the weapons deployed by fixed-wing aircraftrotary aircraft weapons are focused on anti-submarine warfare asw and light to medium surface engagements to combat submarines helicopters use mark 46 and mark 50 torpedoes against small watercraft they utilize hellfire and penguin air to surface missiles helicopters also employ various types of mounted anti-personnel machine guns including the m60 m240 gau-16/a and gau-17/anuclear weapons in the us navy arsenal are deployed through ballistic missile submarines and aircraft the ohio-class submarine carries the latest iteration of the trident missile a three-stage submarine-launched ballistic missile slbm with mirv capability the current trident ii d5 version is expected to be in service past 2020 the navys other nuclear weapon is the air-deployed b61 nuclear bomb the b61 is a thermonuclear device that can be dropped by strike aircraft such as the fa-18 hornet and super hornet at high speed from a large range of altitudes it can be released through free-fall or parachute and can be set to detonate in the air or on the groundthe current naval jack of the united states is the first navy jack traditionally regarded as having been used during the american revolutionary war on 31 may 2002 secretary of the navy gordon r england directed all us naval ships to fly the first navy jack for the duration of the war on terror many ships chose to shift colors later that year on the first anniversary of the september 11 2001 attacks the previous naval jack was a blue field with 50 white stars identical to the canton of the ensign the flag of the united states both in appearance and size and remains in use with vessels of the us coast guard and national oceanic and atmospheric administration a jack of similar design was used in 1794 though with 13 stars arranged in a 32323 pattern when a ship is moored or anchored the jack is flown from the bow of the ship while the ensign is flown from the stern when underway the ensign is raised on the mainmast the first naval jack however has always been flown on the oldest ship in the active american fleet which is currently ussblue ridgelcc-19many past and present united states historical figures have served in the navy notable officers include john paul jones john barry continental navy officer and first flag officer of the united states navy edward preble james lawrence whose last words dont give up the ship are memorialized in bancroft hall at the united states naval academy stephen decatur jr david farragut david dixon porter oliver hazard perry commodore matthew perry whose black ships forced the opening of japan george dewey the only person in the history of the united states to have attained the rank of admiral of the navy and the officers who attained the rank of fleet admiral during world war ii william d leahy ernest j king chester w nimitz and william f halsey jrthe first american president who served in the navy was john f kennedy who commanded the famous pt-109 others included lyndon b johnson richard nixon gerald ford jimmy carter and george h w bush both theodore roosevelt and franklin d roosevelt were the assistant secretary of the navy prior to their presidencies many members of congress served in the navy notably us senators bob kerrey john mccain and john kerry other notable former members of the us navy include astronauts entertainers authors and professional athletes
