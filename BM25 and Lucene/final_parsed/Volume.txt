volume  wikipedia volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed by a closed surface for example the space that a substance solid liquid gas or plasma or shape occupies or contains volume is often quantified numerically using the si derived unit the cubic metre the volume of a container is generally understood to be the capacity of the container i e the amount of fluid gas or liquid that the container could hold rather than the amount of space the container itself displacesthree dimensional mathematical shapes are also assigned volumes volumes of some simple shapes such as regular straight-edged and circular shapes can be easily calculated using arithmetic formulas volumes of a complicated shape can be calculated by integral calculus if a formula exists for the shapes boundary where a variance in shape and volume occurs such as those that exist between different human beings these can be calculated using three-dimensional techniques such as the body volume index one-dimensional figures such as lines and two-dimensional shapes such as squares are assigned zero volume in the three-dimensional spacethe volume of a solid whether regularly or irregularly shaped can be determined by fluid displacement displacement of liquid can also be used to determine the volume of a gas the combined volume of two substances is usually greater than the volume of one of the substances however sometimes one substance dissolves in the other and the combined volume is not additivein differential geometry volume is expressed by means of the volume form and is an important global riemannian invariant in thermodynamics volume is a fundamental parameter and is a conjugate variable to pressureany unit of length gives a corresponding unit of volume the volume of a cube whose sides have the given length for example a cubic centimetre cm is the volume of a cube whose sides are one centimetre 1cm in lengthin the international system of units si the standard unit of volume is the cubic metre m the metric system also includes the litre l as a unit of volume where one litre is the volume of a 10-centimetre cube thussosmall amounts of liquid are often measured in millilitres wherevarious other traditional units of volume are also in use including the cubic inch the cubic foot the cubic mile the teaspoon the tablespoon the fluid ounce the fluid dram the gill the pint the quart the gallon the minim the barrel the cord the peck the bushel and the hogsheadcapacity is defined by the oxford english dictionary as the measure applied to the content of a vessel and to liquids grain or the like which take the shape of that which holds them the word capacity has other unrelated meanings as in eg capacity management capacity is not identical in meaning to volume though closely related the capacity of a container is always the volume in its interior units of capacity are the si litre and its derived units and imperial units such as gill pint gallon and others units of volume are the cubes of units of length in si the units of volume and capacity are closely related one litre is exactly 1 cubic decimetre the capacity of a cube with a 10cm side in other systems the conversion is not trivial the capacity of a vehicles fuel tank is rarely stated in cubic feet for example but in gallons a gallon fills a volume of 0.1605 cu ftthe density of an object is defined as the ratio of the mass to the volume the inverse of density is specific volume which is defined as volume divided by mass specific volume is a concept important in thermodynamics where the volume of a working fluid is often an important parameter of a system being studiedthe volumetric flow rate in fluid dynamics is the volume of fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time for example cubic meters per second m sin calculus a branch of mathematics the volume of a region d in r is given by a triple integral of the constant function  and is usually written asthe volume integral in cylindrical coordinates isand the volume integral in spherical coordinates using the convention for angles with  as the azimuth and  measured from the polar axis see more on conventions has the formthe above formulas can be used to show that the volumes of a cone sphere and cylinder of the same radius and height are in the ratio 123 as followslet the radius be r and the height be h which is 2r for the sphere then the volume of cone isthe volume of the sphere iswhile the volume of the cylinder isthe discovery of the 23 ratio of the volumes of the sphere and cylinder is credited to archimedesthe volume of a sphere is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally small circular disks of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a sphere with center 0 and radius r is as followsthe surface area of the circular disk is the radius of the circular disks defined such that the x-axis cuts perpendicularly through them isorwhere y or z can be taken to represent the radius of a disk at a particular x valueusing y as the disk radius the volume of the sphere can be calculated asnowcombining yields this formula can be derived more quickly using the formula for the spheres surface area which is  the volume of the sphere consists of layers of infinitesimally thin spherical shells and the sphere volume is equal tothe cone is a type of pyramidal shape the fundamental equation for pyramids one-third times base times altitude applies to cones as wellhowever using calculus the volume of a cone is the integral of an infinite number of infinitesimally thin circular disks of thickness dx the calculation for the volume of a cone of height h whose base is centered at 0 0 0 with radius r is as followsthe radius of each circular disk is r if x  0 and 0 if x  h and varying linearly in betweenthat isthe surface area of the circular disk is thenthe volume of the cone can then be calculated asand after extraction of the constantsintegrating gives usin differential geometry a branch of mathematics a volume form on a differentiable manifold is a differential form of top degree ie whose degree is equal to the dimension of the manifold that is nowhere equal to zero a manifold has a volume form if and only if it is orientable an orientable manifold has infinitely many volume forms since multiplying a volume form by a non-vanishing function yields another volume form on non-orientable manifolds one may instead define the weaker notion of a density integrating the volume form gives the volume of the manifold according to that forman oriented pseudo-riemannian manifold has a natural volume form in local coordinates it can be expressed aswhere the  are 1-forms that form a positively oriented basis for the cotangent bundle of the manifold and  is the determinant of the matrix representation of the metric tensor on the manifold in terms of the same basisin thermodynamics the volume of a system is an important extensive parameter for describing its thermodynamic state the specific volume an intensive property is the systems volume per unit of mass volume is a function of state and is interdependent with other thermodynamic properties such as pressure and temperature for example volume is related to the pressure and temperature of an ideal gas by the ideal gas law
