the bahamas  wikipedia the bahamas  known officially as the commonwealth of the bahamas is an archipelagic state within the lucayan archipelago it consists of more than 700 islands cays and islets in the atlantic ocean and is located north of cuba and hispaniola haiti and the dominican republic northwest of the turks and caicos islands southeast of the us state of florida and east of the florida keys the capital is nassau on the island of new providence the designation of the bahamas can refer either to the country or to the larger island chain that it shares with the turks and caicos islands as stated in the mandatemanifesto of the royal bahamas defence force the bahamas territory encompasses 470,000km 180,000sqmi of ocean spacethe bahamas is the site of columbus first landfall in the new world in 1492 at that time the islands were inhabited by the lucayan a branch of the arawakan-speaking taino people although the spanish never colonised the bahamas they shipped the native lucayans to slavery in hispaniola the islands were mostly deserted from 1513 until 1648 when english colonists from bermuda settled on the island of eleutherathe bahamas became a british crown colony in 1718 when the british clamped down on piracy after the american war of independence the crown resettled thousands of american loyalists in the bahamas they brought their slaves with them and established plantations on land grants africans constituted the majority of the population from this period the slave trade was abolished by the british in 1807 slavery in the bahamas was abolished in 1834 the bahamas became a haven for freed african slaves the royal navy resettled africans here liberated from illegal slave ships american slaves and seminoles escaped here from florida and the government freed american slaves carried on united states domestic ships that had reached the bahamas due to weather today afro-bahamians make up nearly 90% of the populationthe bahamas became an independent commonwealth realm in 1973 retaining the british monarch then and currently queen elizabeth ii as its head of state in terms of gross domestic product per capita the bahamas is one of the richest countries in the americas following the united states and canada with an economy based on tourism and financethe name bahamas is mostly likely derived from either the tano  big upper middle land which was a term for the region used by the indigenous native americans or possibly from the spanish  shallow water or sea or low tide reflecting the shallow waters of the area alternatively it may originate from  a local name of unclear meaninga peculiarity of the name is that the word the is a formal part of the abbreviated name and is therefore capitalised so in contrast to the congo and the united kingdom it is proper to write the bahamastaino people moved into the uninhabited southern bahamas from hispaniola and cuba around the 11th century having migrated there from south america they came to be known as the lucayan people an estimated 30,000 lucayan inhabited the bahamas at the time of christopher columbus arrival in 1492columbuss first landfall in the new world was on an island he named san salvador known to the lucayan as guanahani some researchers believe this site to be present-day san salvador island formerly known as watlings island situated in the southeastern bahamas an alternative theory holds that columbus landed to the southeast on samana cay according to calculations made in 1986 by national geographic writer and editor joseph judge based on columbuss log evidence in support of this remains inconclusive on the landfall island columbus made first contact with the lucayan and exchanged goods with themthe spanish forced much of the lucayan population to hispaniola for use as forced labour the slaves suffered from harsh conditions and most died from contracting diseases to which they had no immunity half of the taino died from smallpox alone the population of the bahamas was severely diminishedin 1648 the eleutherian adventurers led by william sayle migrated from bermuda these english puritans established the first permanent european settlement on an island which they named eleutherathe name derives from the greek word for freedom they later settled new providence naming it sayles island after one of their leaders to survive the settlers salvaged goods from wrecksin 1670 king charles ii granted the islands to the lords proprietors of the carolinas in north america they rented the islands from the king with rights of trading tax appointing governors and administering the country in 1684 spanish corsair juan de alcon raided the capital charles town later renamed nassau in 1703 a joint franco-spanish expedition briefly occupied the bahamian capital during the war of the spanish successionduring proprietary rule the bahamas became a haven for pirates including the infamous blackbeard circa 16801718 to put an end to the pirates republic and restore orderly government britain made the bahamas a crown colony in 1718 under the royal governorship of woodes rogers after a difficult struggle he succeeded in suppressing piracy in 1720 rogers led local militia to drive off a spanish attackduring the american war of independence in the late 18th century the islands became a target for american naval forces under the command of commodore esek hopkins us marines occupied the capital of nassau for a fortnightin 1782 following the british defeat at yorktown a spanish fleet appeared off the coast of nassau the city surrendered without a fight spain returned possession of the bahamas to britain the following year under the terms of the treaty of paris before the news was received however the islands were recaptured by a small british force led by andrew deveauxafter american independence the british resettled some 7,300 loyalists with their slaves in the bahamas and granted land to the planters to help compensate for losses on the continent these loyalists who included deveaux established plantations on several islands and became a political force in the capital european americans were outnumbered by the african-american slaves they brought with them and ethnic europeans remained a minority in the territoryin 1807 the british abolished the slave trade followed by the united states the next year during the following decades the royal navy intercepted the trade they resettled in the bahamas thousands of africans liberated from slave shipsin the 1820s during the period of the seminole wars in florida hundreds of american slaves and african seminoles escaped from cape florida to the bahamas they settled mostly on northwest andros island where they developed the village of red bays from eyewitness accounts 300 escaped in a mass flight in 1823 aided by bahamians in 27 sloops with others using canoes for the journey this was commemorated in 2004 by a large sign at bill baggs cape florida state park some of their descendants in red bays continue african seminole traditions in basket making and grave markingthe united states national park service which administers the national underground railroad network to freedom is working with the african bahamian museum and research center abac in nassau on development to identify red bays as a site related to american slaves search for freedom the museum has researched and documented the african seminoles escape from southern florida it plans to develop interpretive programs at historical sites in red bay associated with the period of their settlement in the bahamasin 1818 the home office in london had ruled that any slave brought to the bahamas from outside the british west indies would be manumitted this led to a total of nearly 300 slaves owned by us nationals being freed from 1830 to 1835 the american slave ships comet and encomium used in the united states domestic coastwise slave trade were wrecked off abaco island in december 1830 and february 1834 respectively when wreckers took the masters passengers and slaves into nassau customs officers seized the slaves and british colonial officials freed them over the protests of the americans there were 165 slaves on the comet and 48 on the encomium britain finally paid an indemnity to the united states in those two cases in 1855 under the treaty of claims of 1853 which settled several compensation cases between the two nationsslavery was abolished in the british empire on 1 august 1834 after that british colonial officials freed 78 american slaves from the enterprise which went into bermuda in 1835 and 38 from the hermosa which wrecked off abaco island in 1840 the most notable case was that of the creole in 1841 as a result of a slave revolt on board the leaders ordered the american brig to nassau it was carrying 135 slaves from virginia destined for sale in new orleans the bahamian officials freed the 128 slaves who chose to stay in the islands the creole case has been described as the most successful slave revolt in us historythese incidents in which a total of 447 slaves belonging to us nationals were freed from 1830 to 1842 increased tension between the united states and great britain they had been co-operating in patrols to suppress the international slave trade but worried about the stability of its large domestic slave trade and its value the united states argued that britain should not treat its domestic ships that came to its colonial ports under duress as part of the international trade the united states worried that the success of the creole slaves in gaining freedom would encourage more slave revolts on merchant shipsin august 1940 after his abdication of the british throne the duke of windsor was installed as governor of the bahamas arriving with his wife the duchess although disheartened at the condition of government house they tried to make the best of a bad situation he did not enjoy the position and referred to the islands as a third-class british colonyhe opened the small local parliament on 29 october 1940 the couple visited the out islands that november on axel wenner-grens yacht which caused controversy the british foreign office strenuously objected because they had been advised mistakenly by united states intelligence that wenner-gren was a close friend of the luftwaffe commander hermann gring of nazi germanythe duke was praised at the time for his efforts to combat poverty on the islands a 1991 biography by philip ziegler however described him as contemptuous of the bahamians and other non-european peoples of the empire he was praised for his resolution of civil unrest over low wages in nassau in june 1942 when there was a full-scale riot ziegler said that the duke blamed the trouble on mischief makers  communists and men of central european jewish descent who had secured jobs as a pretext for obtaining a deferment of draftthe duke resigned the post on 16 march 1945modern political development began after the second world war the first political parties were formed in the 1950s the british parliament authorised the islands as internally self-governing

castaway cay it is located near great abaco island and was formerly known as gorda cay in 1997 the walt disney company purchased a 99-year land lease for the cay from the bahamian government set to expire in 2096the climate of the bahamas is tropical savannah climate or aw according to kppen climate classification the low latitude warm tropical gulf stream and low elevation give the bahamas a warm and winterless climate as such there has never been a frost or freeze reported in the bahamas although every few decades low temperatures can fall below 10c 50f for a few hours when a severe cold outbreak comes off the north american mainland there is only an 8c difference between the warmest month and coolest month in most of the bahama islands as with most tropical climates seasonal rainfall follows the sun and summer is the wettest season the bahamas are often sunny and dry for long periods of time and average more than 3,000 hours or 340 days of sunlight annuallytropical storms and hurricanes can on occasion impact the bahamas in 1992 hurricane andrew passed over the northern portions of the islands and hurricane floyd passed near the eastern portions of the islands in

the formation of the north atlantic the 6.4km thick limestones which predominately make up the bahamas date back to the cretaceous these limestones would have been deposited in shallow seas assumed to be a stretched and thinned portion of the north american continental crust sediments were forming at about the same rate as the crust below was sinking due to the added weight thus the entire area consisted of a large marine plain with some islands then at about 80 ma the area became flooded by the gulf stream this resulted in the drowning of the blake plateau the separation of the bahamas from cuba and florida the separation of the southeastern bahamas into separate banks the creation of the cay sal bank plus the little and great bahama banks sedimentation from the carbonate factory of each bank or atoll continues today at the rate of about 2cm per kyr coral reefs form the retaining walls of these atolls within which oolites and pellets formcoral growth was greater through the tertiary until the start of the ice ages and hence those deposits are more abundant below a depth of 36 m in fact an ancient extinct reef exists half a km seaward of the present one 30 m below sea level oolites form when oceanic water penetrate the shallow banks increasing the temperature about 3c and the salinity by 0.5 per cent cemented ooids are referred to as grapestone additionally giant stromatolites are found off the exuma cayssea level changes resulted in a drop in sea level causing wind blown oolite to form sand dunes with distinct cross-bedding overlapping dunes form oolitic ridges which become rapidly lithified through the action of rainwater most islands have ridges ranging from 30 to 45 m though cat island has a ridge 60 m in height the land between ridges is conducive to the formation of lakes and swampssolution weathering of the limestone results in a bahamian karst topography this includes potholes blue holes such as deans blue hole sinkholes beachrock such as the bimini road pavements of atlantis limestone crust caves due to the lack of rivers and sea caves several blue holes are aligned along the south andros fault line tidal flats and tidal creeks are common but the more impressive drainage patterns are formed by troughs and canyons such as great bahama canyon with the evidence of turbidity currents and turbidite depositionthe bahamas is a
