hurricane inez  wikipedia hurricane inez was a major hurricane that affected the caribbean bahamas florida and mexico in 1966 it was the first storm on record to affect all of those areas it originated from a tropical wave over africa and became a tropical depression by september21 it moved slowly westward initially failing to intensify much it was upgraded to tropical storm inez on september24 the storm strengthened into a hurricane and was quickly intensifying when it struck the french overseas region of guadeloupe on september27 inez severely damaged the islands banana and sugar crops and thousands of homes were damaged leaving 10,000people homeless damage on guadeloupe was estimated at 50million and there were 40deaths after entering the caribbean inez briefly weakened before restrengthening attaining peak sustained winds of 150mph 240kmh on september28 that day a hurricane hunters flight reported a gust of 197mph 317kmh which was the highest recorded at the timecontinuing westward inez made landfall as a small hurricane on the barahona peninsula of the dominican republic there the storm flooded many rivers and destroyed over 800houses nationwide there were about 100deaths and 12million in damage after affecting the country inez struck southwestern haiti where it was considered the worst hurricane since the 1920s as many as 1,000people were killed and 60,000people were left homeless damage totaled 20.35million in haiti prompting the united states government to send aid for the first time in nearly ten years due to previous mishandling of funds inez weakened quickly over hispaniola although it reintensified into a major hurricane before striking southeastern cuba on september30 in the country 125,000people were forced to evacuate and there were three deaths and 20million in damagethe hurricane moved slowly over cuba for two days before emerging into the atlantic ocean near the bahamas it was expected to continue out to sea although it stalled and resumed its previous westward path in the bahamas heavy rainfall and high tides caused flooding which killed five people and left 15.5million in damage hurricane-force winds occurred throughout the florida keys where 160homes and 190trailers were damaged salt spray damaged crops in the region and there was 5million in damage and four deaths in the straits of florida inez capsized a boat of cuban refugees killing 45people in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after carrying evacuees from an oil rig killing 11people the hurricane threatened the northern yucatn peninsula and although it remained offshore inez produced flooding and caused some power outages at its final landfall inez flooded portions of tamaulipas and cut off roads to tampico about 84,000people were left homeless and the hurricane destroyed at least 2,500houses damage was estimated at 104million and there were 74deaths in mexicothe origins of inez were from a tropical wave that formed over the sahara in central africa on september15 from the monsoon it moved westward in the prevailing winds exiting the west coast of africa on september18 the precursor to inez was a disturbance along the northern portion of the wave which was considered a tropical depression by september18 in the annual tropical cyclone summary tracked by satellites the system moved to the west-southwest and was officially classified a tropical depression on september21 about halfway between the lesser antilles and africa the system remained weak as it turned toward the west-northwest a hurricane hunters flight indicated some intensification in the system prompting the national hurricane center nhc to initiate advisories on tropical storm inez located about 800mi 1,300km east of martinique with warm water temperatures the storm developed a circular area of convection over its center inez slowed while curving westward around a ridge to its north and quickly intensified reaching hurricane status on september26on september27 inez strengthened to reach winds of 120mph 195kmh making it a category3 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale later that day it moved directly over the island of guadeloupe at the time inez was a small cyclone with hurricane-force winds extending 50mi 80km from the center meteorologists labeled it as a micro-hurricane because of its characteristic small tight cloud structure and strong maximum surface wind its structure became disrupted by the island and the central pressure rose from 961mbar 28.4inhg to 970mbar 29inhg indicative of weakening however inez re-intensified after entering the eastern caribbean sea reaching a minimum pressure of 929mbar 27.4inhg south of puerto rico on september28 the hurricane hunters reported sustained winds of 197mph 317kmh at a height of 8,000ft 2,400m the strongest winds recorded for the storm the same flight estimated surface winds between 150 to 175mph 241 to 282kmh near the center the peak intensity listed in the atlantic hurricane database is 150mph 240kmh making inez a strong category 4 hurricanewhile near peak intensity inez was located about 160mi 260km southwest of san juan puerto rico and the eye was tracked by radar from the island its increasing outflow caused tropical storm judith to the east over the central atlantic to dissipate on september29 the small but powerful hurricane made landfall on the barahona peninsula and quickly weakened over land it briefly moved offshore and struck the southern peninsula of haiti near jacmel the eye emerged into the windward passage near logne although severely weakened the pressure rose to 987mbar 29.1inhg and the winds decreased to 90mph 150kmh over land however inez quickly re-intensified over water reaching winds of 115mph 185kmh on september30 before striking southeastern cuba near guantnamo bay when inez was over cuba forecasters had difficulty in predicting the storms future it was expected that the hurricane would move to the north off the east coast of the united states due to a weakness in the ridge to the north the hurricane drifted west-northwestward within light steering currents weakening over the high terrain but later moving offshore the southern coast of cuba while over water the eye reorganized and the cyclone maintained hurricane intensity inez eventually turned to a northward drift over central cuba and emerged into the atlantic ocean on october2shortly after exiting cuba into the atlantic inez weakened into a tropical storm and was moving northeastward through the bahamas about 24hours later than forecast at the time the storm was expected to continue to the northeast around the bermuda high with little outflow and a large diffuse circulation inez did not restrengthen much despite otherwise favorable conditions potentially due to a nearby trough the movement slowed and the 1966 hurricane summary remarked that inez probably became nearly stationary closer to the united states mainland than any other storm on october3 inez turned to the west-southwest as another ridge strengthened over the western gulf of mexico over the subsequent few days the eye moved directly over the florida keys from key largo to key west and continued through the gulf of mexico while slowly intensifying on october7 inez brushed the northern coast of the yucatn peninsula with hurricane-force winds by then the ridge had begun to weaken allowing the hurricane to turn more west-northwestward on october8 inez attained a secondary peak intensity of 140mph 220kmh with a pressure of 948mbar 28.0inhg briefly threatening the coastline of texas inez turned to the southwest after the ridge again strengthened on october10 the hurricane made its final landfall near tampico tamaulipas in northeastern mexico it weakened rapidly over the regions high terrain dissipating on october11the unusual track of inez marked the first time on record that a tropical cyclone affected the lesser and greater antilles bahamas florida and mexico the associated press described inez as the first to strike the yucatn peninsula in many years it was also the first to move across the gulf of mexico without turning to the north so late in the season and the 65advisories issued by the nhc was the highest number at the time the path taken by inez was compared to hurricane betsy in 1965 which also slowed and moved erratically due to a strong ridge forecasters had difficulty with the hurricane because of its unusual path as well as the inability to fly the hurricane hunters into inez while it was over cubain guadeloupe which was the first area the hurricane affected residents evacuated to schools set up as shelters pan american world airways canceled flights to the region when inez was near peak intensity the nhc warned residents in southern haiti and the dominican republic of the danger posed by the hurricane the agency emphasized that the eye was visible on radar to calm tension of an unexpected change in track in general hurricane warnings were issued 24hours in advance with the exception of southeastern florida due to the hurricanes slowing track overall 250,000people evacuated along the path of inez at guantnamo bay officials ordered residents at the naval base to evacuate to storm shelters large ships at the port there were moved to jamaica before the storm struck throughout eastern cuba premier fidel castro ordered about 125,000people to evacuate in low-lying areas mostly in oriente province united states air force tracking stations in the bahamas were secured or moved to safer locations residents in the florida keys boarded up windows and store fronts and hundreds of people evacuated to a shelter in key west in southeastern florida government offices and schools closedalong the yucatn peninsula about 15,000people were evacuated from the coastal city of progreso in a region that seldom experiences hurricanes in the northern gulf of mexico a helicopter crashed after evacuating workers from an oil platform about 65mi 105km south-southwest of morgan city louisiana in otherwise calm conditions 11people died including the pilot when inez was approaching its final landfall the united states weather bureau issued hurricane warnings from brownsville to port isabel texas with gale warnings northward to corpus christi at least 2,000people evacuated from port isabel alone and many shrimp boats were secured in the tampico area where inez made its final landfall over 31,000people evacuated to higher groundsoverall hurricane inez killed about 1,000people mostly on hispaniola and caused over 200million in damage crop damage was less than other storms of similar magnitude due to inezs small size and its occurrence late in the seasonwhen inez struck guadeloupe a station on the island reported sustained winds of 80mph 130kmh with gusts to 94mph 151kmh before communications failed rain on the island reached 6.5in 170mm the high winds destroyed the roofs of thousands of houses leaving 10,000people homeless there was heavy damage to both the banana and sugar crops described as flattened by the st petersburg times the storm flooded a power plant in pointe--pitre and downed many power lines causing power outages the associated press described the hurricane as having virtually leveled a whole district of pointe--pitre hundreds of people were injured although because of damaged hospitals and the power outage most only received makeshift treatment inez left 40people dead and 50million in damage on the island strong winds also affected nearby antigua and damage was reported from that island to dominicain the united states virgin islands a station on st croix reported 45mph 72kmh gusts when inez passed south of puerto rico its rainbands produced gusty winds along the islands southern coast reaching 50mph 80kmh in peuelas on isla de mona wind gusts were estimated at 80mph 130kmh flooding occurred in southern puerto rico and high winds damaged 20houseshurricane inez struck the dominican republic near peak intensity along the barahona peninsula more than 800homes were destroyed and nationwide about 5,000people were left homeless there was heavy damage to the countrys cotton industry as well as the coffee sugar cane and cocoa crops along the barahona peninsula in the capital city of santo domingo heavy rains flooded hundreds of homes along the ozama river forcing thousands to evacuate high seas there damaged a portion of a seawall many rivers along the barahona peninsula were also flooded throughout the country inez killed about 100people including 55 in juancho and left 12million in damagein neighboring haiti high winds downed power lines and radio towers which cut outside communication high rainfall led to flash flooding between mountain ranges in a location nicknamed the valley of death there the weather bureau remarked that local winds may well have exceeded 160mph 260kmh thousands of homes were either destroyed or lost their roof the haitian government reported over 1,000deaths in the weeks after the storm the united states government reported that the hurricane killed no more than 50" in haiti and nor was there a real emergency due to president franois duvalier misusing previous aid the us assessment was incorrect as the 1966 annual tropical cyclone summary in the monthly weather review indicated 750deaths in haiti mostly in jacmel president duvalier considered the hurricane the worst storm since the 1920s in the country 1,000people were injured and 60,000 were left homeless and damage was estimated at 20.35million throughout hispaniola about 1,500people were seriously injured and many people were still recovering from hurricane flora

waves also disabled three ships and beached a coast guard boat near miami a lifeguard and people on the beach assisted in rescuing the crew of nine coast guardsmen amid rough seaswhen the hurricane moved across the florida keys it dropped light rainfall reaching 4.80in 122mm near kendall inez was considered a dry hurricane and about 1in 25mm of the precipitation that fell was largely in the form of sea water spray light rainfall occurred in miami where strong winds damaged crops due to salt spray onto local vegetation during its passage inez produced above normal tides reaching 5ft 1.5m above normal on big pine key inez produced strong winds while it was intensifying and the strongest winds occurred after the passage of the eye the highest sustained winds were 98mph 158kmh on plantation
