mainland north carolina from north to south the largest of these include bodie island which used to be an island but is now a peninsula due to tropical storms and hurricanes hatteras island ocracoke island portsmouth island and the core banks over time the exact number of islands and inlets changes as new inlets are opened up often during a breach created during violent storms and older inlets close usually due to gradually sifting sands during the dynamic processes of beach evolutionthe outer banks stretch southward from sandbridge in virginia beach down the north carolina coastline sources differ regarding the southern terminus of the outer banks generations of north carolina schoolchildren have learned that the term includes the states three prominent capes cape hatteras cape lookout and cape fear other sources limit the definition to two capes cape hatteras and cape lookout and coastal areas in four counties currituck county dare county hyde countyand carteret county some

banks from oregon inlet northward is actually a part of the north american mainland since the northern inlets of bodie island and currituck banks no longer exist it is separated by the currituck sound and the intracoastal waterway which passes through the great dismal swamp occupying much of the mainland west of the outer banks road access to the northern outer banks is cut off between sandbridge and corolla north carolina with communities such as carova beach accessible only by four-wheel drive vehicles north carolina state highway 12 links most of the popular outer banks communities in this section of the coast the easternmost point is cape point at cape hatteras on hatteras island site of the cape hatteras lighthousethe outer banks are not anchored to offshore coral reefs like some other barrier islands and as a consequence they often suffer significant beach erosion during major storms in fact their location jutting out into the atlantic makes them the most hurricane-prone area north of florida for both landfalling storms and brushing storms offshore hatteras island was cut in half on september 18 2003 when hurricane isabel washed a 2,000 foot 600 m wide and 15 foot 5 m deep channel called isabel inlet through the community of hatteras village on the southern end of the island the tear was subsequently repaired and restored by sand dredging by the us army corps of engineers it was cut off once again in 2011 by hurricane irene access to the island was largely limited to boat access only from august to late october until another temporary bridge could be builtthe vegetation of the outer banks varies in the northeast part of the outer banks from virginia beach southward past the north carolina border to oregon inlet the main types of vegetation are sea grasses beach grasses and other beach plants including opuntia humifusa on the atlantic side and wax myrtles bays and grasses on the sound side with areas of pine and spanish moss-covered live oaks yucca aloifolia and yucca gloriosa can be found growing wild here in the northern parts of its range on the beach sabal minor palms were once indigenous to the entire outer banks and they are still successfully planted and grown its current most northerly known native stand is on monkey island in currituck countyfrom cape hatteras national seashore southward the vegetation does include that of the northeastern outer banks such as sabal minor yucca aloifolia and yucca gloriosa however the main vegetation consists of cabbage palmetto sabal palmetto which can be found in the north although they are native in the southern part of the outer banks specifically prevelent from cape hatteras and all points southward pindo palms and windmill palms are also planted widely throughout the outer banks although they are not indigenous to the areaa wide variety of native plants can be found at the elizabethan gardens in manteo on roanoke island the gardens are open year round 7 days a weekthe outer banks have unusual weather patterns because of their unique geographical location as the islands are jutted out from the eastern seaboard into the atlantic gulf stream the outer banks has a predisposition to be affected by hurricanes noreasters usually in the form of rain and rarely snow or mixed precipitation and other ocean-driven stormsthe winters are typically milder than in inland areas averaging lows in the upper 30s and highs in the lower 50s and is more frequently overcast than in the summer however the exposure of the outer banks makes them prone to higher winds often causing wind chills to make the apparent temperature as cold as the inland areas the summer months average lows from the mid-70s to highs in the upper 80s depending on the time of the summer the spring and fall are typically milder seasons the fall and winter are usually warmer than areas inland while the spring and the summer are often slightly cooler because of the moderating effects of being surrounded by wateralthough snow is possible averaging from 3 inches in the north to less than 1/2 inch per year in the south there are many times when years pass between snowfalls the majority of noreasters are born off the coasts of the outer banksthe outer banks were first settled by english european colonial settlers many of whom still have descendants living on the islands to this day before bridges were built in the 1930s the only form of transport between or off the islands was by boat which allowed for the islands to stay isolated from much of the rest of the mainland this helped to preserve the maritime culture and the distinctive outer banks accent or brogue which sounds more like an english accent than it does an american accent many bankers have often been mistaken for being from england or ireland when traveling to areas outside of the outer banks the brogue is more distinctive the further south one travels on the outer banks with it being the thickest on ocracoke island and harkers islandsome residents of the outer banks known as wreckers made part of their living by scavenging wrecked shipsor by luring ships to their destruction horses with lanterns tied to their necks would be walked along the beach the lanterns up and down motion would appear to ships to represent clear water and a ship ahead the unsuspecting captain would then drive his ship ashore following this false lightthe islands are home to herds of feral horses sometimes called banker ponies which according to local legend are descended from spanish mustangs washed ashore centuries ago in shipwrecks populations are found on ocracoke island shackleford banks currituck banks and in the rachel carson estuarine sanctuaryocracoke was the last refuge of pirate edward teach better known as blackbeard it is also where the infamous pirate was killed november 22 1718 in a fierce battle with troops from virginiathe outer banks is home to yaupon holly ilex vomitoria the roasted leaves of which were brewed into a high caffeine beverage called black drink by the native americans the outer banks may be one of the few places where it is still consumedthe outer banks offers a multitude of fishing options for tourists as well as locals there has been a long history of fishing in the outer banks dating back to the end of the 17th century pirates ravaged the coast for the majority of the 1600s but once they were ridden the local settlers used fishing as their lifeline then in the mid-19th century large-scale commercial fishing erupted mostly due to the construction of the albemarle and chesapeake canal which simplified shipping methods for fishermen saltwater fishing became the cash-crop of the outer banks and blossomed it into a popular tourist destination in modern times tourists will flock to the area just for the abundance of fishing opportunities anglers otherwise known as fishermen have a wide range of fishing methods some of these methods date back to when the first settlers arrived to choose from in the outer banksthe outer banks are a popular destination for bottom fish like spot and mullet these two types of fish are caught throughout the year the peak for fishing bottom and top water feeders is early to the middle of may if the angler is solely searching for top water fish then late may and june would be the ideal time to fish especially if they are searching for mackerel in the offseason or winter months the true fishermen are out searching for trout sea bass bluefish bluefin tuna oysters king mackerel bay scallops and striped bass in the spring the popular catches are grouper sea trout sea bass bluefish bluefin and yellowfin tuna oysters snapper striped bass red drum croaker sea mullet king mackerel and wahoo late spring and the beginning of summer is the favored time for top-water fish to move into the coastal waters near the outer banks because of the warming waters and the increased visibility in the water the top water fish can see baitfish easily due to the decrease in murky water plus they will start to migrate back north as the coastal waters to the south become too hot the waters farther north will warm to their desired temperatures yet in the prime tourist season of the summer fishermen and many tourists have plenty of game options such as blue marlin white marlin dolphin wahoo cobia king mackerel bluefish tuna flounder snapper grouper spanish mackerel crabs soft crabs shrimp spot croaker sailfish and sea mullet by the fall most tourists have started to leave but fishermen are still out searching for snapper channel bass bluefish king mackerel grouper tuna oysters striped bass sea mullet spot clams speckled trout flounder and shrimp the prime season for fall fishing is late september to october 23 though the water is more turbulent and murky due to the strong northeast prevailing winds there is still some big game fish left most of these fish are vacating back to the south for the warm waters this makes it a prime time for smaller bottom fish who love to feed in murky colder watertowns and communities along the outer banks include listed from north to south
