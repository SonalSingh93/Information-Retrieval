hurricane hortense  wikipedia hurricane hortense was the first hurricane to make landfall in guadeloupe and puerto rico since hurricane hugo in 1989 the eighth tropical cyclone eighth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 1996 atlantic hurricane season hortense developed on september3 from a tropical wave in the central atlantic oceaninitially a tropical depression it headed westward without significant strengthening for four days due to unfavorable upper-level winds while nearing the lesser antilles upper-level winds decreased allowing the depression to become tropical storm hortense on september7 hortense crossed guadeloupe on september8 and entered the caribbean sea by on the following day it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward hortense made landfall in puerto rico on september9 and brushed the dominican republic shortly thereafterafter re-entering the atlantic hortense began to substantially strengthen and peaked as a 140mph 220kmh category4 hurricane early on september13 thereafter the storm steadily weakened as it tracked rapidly north-northeastward early on september15 hortense made landfall in nova scotia as a minimal category1 hurricane it quickly weakened further to a tropical storm before re-entering the atlantic to the south of newfoundland late on september15 hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and subsequently merged with a frontal system about 24hours laterthe storm produced heavy rainfall and gusty winds as it passed through the lesser antilles on guadeloupe damage was most significant to crops with over 50% of banana plantains destroyed localized flooding was reported on martinique impact was most significant in puerto rico across the island 11,463houses were severely damaged about 1.4million people on puerto rico were left without electricity  equivalent to about 40% of the islands population damage in puerto rico was estimated at 153.4million 1996usd there were also 19deaths most of which due to drowning during flash floods in the dominican republic strong winds damaged a number of buildings and houses and downed several power lines flooding also forced the closure of several roads and impacted 80% of crops in saman province at least three fatalities were confirmed in that country the storm brought strong winds to the bahamas and turks and caicos islands and lesser winds to bermudalater in its duration hortense struck nova scotia bringing heavy rainfall and hurricane-force winds to isolated locations there were many power outages trees blown down roofs torn away and roads damaged in the province new brunswick newfoundland and prince edward island were also impacted though not as severely as in nova scotia damage in atlantic canada reached approximately 3.64milliona tropical wave and a broad low-pressure area associated with it exited the west coast of africa near dakar senegal on august30 the low-pressure area which had deepened to 1,005mbar 29.7inhg by august31 moved south of cape verde although deep convection was minimal on satellite imagery the system possessed a well-defined low- to mid-level circulation after crossing several national oceanic and atmospheric administration buoys early on september3 it was determined that the system developed into tropical depression eight at 1200utc on that same day while located about halfway between cape verde and the lesser antilles under the influence of strong high pressure ridge the depression tracked almost due westward without significant intensification convection remained sporadic and disorganized with a reconnaissance flight finding a board circulation and a few squall on september6 while nearing the leeward islands upper-level winds reduced to a favorable level causing strengthening and allowing deep convection to increaseat 0600utc on september7 the depression had intensified into tropical storm hortense a reconnaissance flight around that time reported winds of 71mph 114kmh confirming the storm was strengthening early on september8 hortense struck guadeloupe with winds of 60mph 95kmh shortly thereafter intensification slowed due to increased vertical wind shear by upper-level short wave in the eastern caribbean sea convection diminished with satellite imagery showing a tropical cyclone with the low-level circulation exposed the short-wave soon left the area causing wind shear to decrease and convection quickly re-developedby early on september9 hortense was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward around 0600utc on the following day the storm made landfall near gunica puerto rico with winds of 80mph 130kmh this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since hurricane hugo in 1989 initially most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the dominican republic after two hours hortense emerged into the mona passage and brushed the eastern tip of dominican republic punta cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on september10 land interaction with hispaniola weakened the storm slightly though it would soon re-strengthenwhile tracking east of turks and caicos islands on september11 hortense became a category2 hurricane and then to a category3 hurricane by early on the following day continuing to intensify hortense reached category4 intensity on september12 around that time a developing trough centered over the eastern united states caused the storm to curve almost due northward and accelerate at 0000utc on september13 hortense attained its peak intensity with a maximum sustained wind speed of 140mph 220kmh and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar 27.6inhgafter maintaining category4 intensity for 24hours the storm weakened back to a category3 hurricane while passing well east of bermuda hortense was downgraded to a category2 hurricane early on september14 later that day the storm weakened further to a category1 hurricane early on september15 hortense made its final landfall near west quoddy nova scotia with winds of 75mph 120kmh hortense weakened over nova scotia and was a tropical storm when it re-emerged into the atlantic less than nine hours after landfall by 1800utc on september15 hortense transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while just south of newfoundland the storms remnants merged with a frontal system on the following dayshortly after hortense intensified into a tropical storm a tropical storm warning was issued by the respective governments from martinique to the united states virgin islands late on september7 about 57hours before the hurricanes puerto rico landfall a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for puerto rico however the watch was discontinued at 1500utc on september8 after the storm experienced increased wind shear in the region at the same time a hurricane warning was left after having been issued for the british and united states virgin islands 12hours earlier at 1500utc on september9 about fifteen hours before landfall a hurricane warning was issued in puerto rico the downgrade of the warning on the island led residents to underestimate the hurricanes threat before hortense struck puerto rico the local national weather service office warned of the potential of rainfall exceeding 10in 250mm with higher totals in the mountainslate on september9 a hurricane warning was issued for portions of eastern dominican republic which was eventually extended along the countrys northern coastline a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the north coast of haiti to st nicolas on september10 a hurricane warning was issued for the turks and caicos islands and for the bahamas islands of inagua and mayaguana a hurricane watch was also issued for the central bahamaswhile still a tropical storm hortense moved through the lesser antilles with significant amounts of precipitation a station on guadeloupe reported a total of 12.5in 320mm both la dsirade and pointe--pitre international airport observed 81mph 130kmh wind gusts and sustained winds of 53mph 85kmh the storm caused significant crop damage destroying roughly over 50 percent of the banana plantain further south heavy rains led to scattered flooding in martinique which inundated streets while strong winds knocked down power lines one man who attempted to drive across a flooded road was rescued from his vehicle seconds before it was swept awaywhile hortense passed south of saint croix the storm produced sustained winds of 39mph 63kmh at henry e rohlsen airport with unofficial gusts to 62mph 100kmh hortense dropped heavy rainfall that peaked at 18.0in 460mm in christiansted the rains flooded low-lying areas of frederiksted on nearby saint thomas the storm dropped 7.0in 180mm of rainfall with gusts reaching only 30mph 48kmhas hortense approached puerto rico the eastern half of the circulation had a concentrated area of thunderstorms while the hurricane crossed the southwest portion of the island it dropped heavy rainfall of over 10in 250mm in much of the territorys eastern half totals ranged from below 1in 25mm near where the storm moved ashore to a peak of 23.5in 600mm near cayey three stations broke their 12hour rainfall records and two stations broke their 24hour rainfall records the highest 24hour total was 19.5in 500mm in las piedras the rainfall caused widespread flash flooding and increased river discharge a station along the ro grande de loza in san lorenzo reported a 1 in 100 year flow rate rivers and creeks across the region reached high peaks and there were several reports of mudslides sustained winds on the island peaked at 46mph 74kmh in ceiba and gusts reached 62mph 100kmh in carolina an unofficial wind gust of 109mph 175kmh in the southwest portion of the island may have been caused by the venturi effect or an acceleration of winds between walls along the southern puerto rico coast hortense caused coastal flooding and beach erosionan overflown river near san juan flooded several homes across the island hortense left about 1.3million people without power and 1.1million customers without water during the storm 10,563people evacuated to storm shelters across the island 11,463houses were severely damaged by hortense the hurricane left 128.4million in crop damage primarily to coffee plantains and bananas there was another 25million from road damage there were 19deaths on the island many of whom due to flash flood drownings some 1,400,000people about 40% of the population lost power during and after the storm straining the cleanup effort in the following days and weeks with lack of air conditioning and spoiled foodwhile hortense was near the eastern tip of the dominican republic punta cana reported sustained winds of 92mph 148kmh which was the highest land wind report associated with the hurricane puerto plata along the northern coast also reported hurricane-force winds high winds destroyed a school and church damaged several houses and downed several power lines like its effects in puerto rico hortense dropped heavy rainfall in the dominican republic peaking at 19.25in 489mm in san rafael del yuma while passing the region the hurricane produced a 9ft 2.7m storm surge the combination of the surge and heavy rainfall produced flooding that closed roadways hortense damaged 80% of the crops in saman in the country the hurricane killed three people and left 21missingon grand turk island wind gusts reached 90mph 140kmh while hortense passed nearby the same station reported sustained winds of 60mph 97kmhthe bahamas threatened by their second major hurricane in two weeks fared well from the storm with little damage and no casualtiesin bermuda a sustained wind speed of 34mph 55kmh and a gust to 48mph 77kmh were measured on september13 slightly lesser winds were reported the following day the storm also brought rainfall to the island though total amounts are unknownin nova scotia hortense dropped heavy rainfall and caused strong winds causing power outages uprooted trees and moderate structural damage amounting to 3million 1996 usd rainfall was light on prince edward island with the highest observed being 1.7 inches 43mm in charlottetown strong winds were reported throughout the province gusts reached 52mph 84kmh in charlottetown and 80mph 130kmh elsewhere the winds downed power lines leaving numerous residents without electricity especially in charlottetown east point montague murray river souris effects were almost nil in new brunswick limited to rainfall peaking at 2.1 inches 53mm though most of it was a storm system that preceded hortenses passage sustained winds in the province were light reaching about 27mph 43kmhon september11 president bill clinton declared a major disaster in 68 of the 78municipalities of puerto rico this allowed federal funding for debris removal repairing public roads and buildings and assistance to individually affected residentsthe name hortense was retired in spring of 1997 following this storm and will not be used again in this basin it was replaced with hanna in the 2002 atlantic hurricane season
