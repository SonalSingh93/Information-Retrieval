2017 north indian ocean cyclone season  wikipedia the 2017 north indian ocean cyclone season is a current event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation north indian ocean cyclone season has no official bounds but cyclones tend to form between april and december with the two peaks in may and november these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern indian oceanthe scope of this article is limited to the indian ocean in the northern hemisphere east of the horn of africa and west of the malay peninsula there are two main seas in the north indian ocean the arabian sea to the west of the indian subcontinent abbreviated arb by the india meteorological department imd and the bay of bengal to the east abbreviated bob by the imd the official regional specialized meteorological centre in this basin is the imd while the joint typhoon warning center jtwc releases unofficial advisories on average three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every seasonover the indian ocean is the risk for at least a couple of tropical systems to make landfall this autumn according to accuweather the best chance for tropical depressions or cyclones in the bay of bengal or the arabian sea will be during october and november during september one or two systems may be declared a depression over the northern bay of bengal and could strike eastern india in west bengal or orissa coasts according to myanmar meteorological department a cyclone or depression is likely to form in the last week of october in andaman sea and travel towards the bay of bengalthe season officially had an early start compared with the last two seasons with the formation of cyclone maarutha over the bay of bengal in mid-aprilthe strongest storm of the season so far was cyclone mora which formed in late may over the bay of bengal the system made landfall in bangladesh with three-minute sustained winds of 110kmh 70mph and one-minute sustained winds of 120kmh 75mph at this strength its peak intensity it was equivalent to a marginal category 1 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale the cyclone produced severe flooding across sri lanka india  myanmar and bangladesh and caused 15 deaths directly and 203 deaths indirectly the floods persisted in bangladesh since a deep depression over bay of bengal made landfall and killed 156 people in bangladesh a depression formed in northwestern bay of bengal and produced torrential rainfall it was followed by a depression over jharkhand which killed 70 people in west bengal under the influence of strong monsoon surge a disturbance developed over bay of bengal travelled westwards and intensified to a depression it also affected neighboring karachi in pakistanon april 13 an area of low pressure formed in the south bay of bengal under the influence of a persistent area of convection in a span of six hours under favorable conditions rapid deepening took place and the system was classified as a depression on april 15 later on the same day it further intensified into a deep depression and then into cyclonic storm maaruthathe system moved very fast under the influence of mid-latitude trough in westerlies lying over india in the middle and upper tropospheric levels however strong vertical wind shear and unfavourable mjo inhibited rapid intensification or further intensification of the system moving northeastwards it reached its peak intensity in the early hours of 16th the system maintained its peak intensity till landfall near sandoway thandwe in myanmar in the midnight after landfall the system weakened into a deep depression in early hours of 17th into a depression in the morning and well marked low pressure area over central myanmar and neighbourhood in the forenoon of 17thmaarutha had already triggered heavy rainfall as a depression in sri lanka as well as the andaman and nicobar islands india due to a heavy swell in the sea around the andaman islands all ferries to havelock island from port blair were suspended on leaving nearly 1,500 tourists stranded in kyaukpyu maarutha destroyed more than 81 households and total damages amounted to ks31.8 million us23,400 as of april 18 four people were reported to be killed in the irrawady division of myanmar maarutha developed as a depression in the first fortnight of april climatologically the formation of tropical cyclones in the bay of bengal at this time of the year is rare only twelve cyclones have developed over the bay of bengal during 1891-2016under the influence of a persistent area of convection a low-pressure area formed over the southeast bay of bengal on may 26 it rapidly strengthened on may 28 with the imd classifying it as a depression and subsequently into a deep depression on the same day designating it bob 02 in the early hours of may 29 the imd reported the storm to have reached cyclonic storm intensity naming it mora the storm followed a north-northeasterly track parallel to myanmar coastthe system moved fast under the influence of mid-latitude trough in westerlies lying over india in the middle and upper tropospheric levels and the anti-cyclonic cyclonic circulation lying to the northeast of the system shortly before landfall the storm reached its peak intensity as a severe cyclonic storm with winds of 110kmh and a minimum central pressure of 978 hpa mbarthe jtwc analysed it having reached category 1 hurricane strength with winds of 120kmh on the same day at peak intensity the storm made landfall on the southern coast of bangladesh near chittagong at ist 6:00 am after landfall the storm steadily weakened due to land interaction and dissipated into a well-marked low-pressure area over nagaland on may 31a total of 31 people have been killed9 in bangladesh and 1 in myanmar and 19 in manipur damage throughout all the affected countries totalled almost usd 1.37 billion two people were reported to be killed in malda district of west bengalalso although not directly related to the storm the precursor low of mora strengthened the arrival of the monsoon causing heavy flooding in sri lanka and the andaman islands that killed 208 peoplea depression originated from a monsoonal low pressure area on june 11 in north west bay of bengal and was assigned the designation bob 03 by the india meteorological department the system strengthened into a deep depression before making landfall in bangladesh at about 5:00 am local time on 12 june 23:00 utc 11 june at peak intensity the system had three-minute sustained winds of 55kmh 35mph and a minimum central pressure of 988 hpa 29.18 inhg at least 156 people have been confirmed dead following landslides caused in the rangamati bandarban and chittagong districts of bangladesh along with 14 others in northeast india caused by torrential rainfall the imd published its final bulletin on the system following its weakening below tropical depression intensity into a well-marked low pressure area at 02:30 utc on 13 june the system helped in the advancement of monsoon over the regions of west bengal and odisha damages included loss of tk 1800 crore usd 223 milliona low pressure area consolidated into a depression over the northwestern and adjoining west-central bay of bengal off odisha coast on july 17 the imd began issuing advisories on a depression that it was very likely to cross the coast by nightthe depression moved in a generally northwestwards direction without intensifying and made landfall on indias odisha coast south of puri at about 15:00 utc 20:30 ist on july 18 heavy rainfall peaking at dondilohara in chhattisgarh receiving 270mm and dabubagan in odisha receiving 200mm in 24 hrs along with sustained winds of 45kmh 30mph affected the region causing at least a dozen villages to be submerged in floodwater and five bridges to be washed away as many as 6,000 people were evacuated in nabarangpur and an estimated 65,000 people were directly affected by the dangerous weather as of july 31 at least seven people have been killed as a result of the storm total losses were estimated at rs 219 croreusd 34.3 milliona well-marked low-pressure area over jharkhand and adjoining the gangetic west bengal intensified into a depression on july 26 it moved in a west-northwest direction until degenerated to a well marked low pressure area over east madhya pradesh during the next daythe storm in its precursor low caused dangerous floods in west bengal at least 152 people died while nearly 20 lakh were affected in over 160 villages which were inundated due to heavy rains 2,301 people were evacuated from their houses and 2,02,957 hectare of agricultural land was submerged around 7,868 houses were entirely destroyed while 44,361 were partially damaged in west bengal the state lost around rs14000 croresusd 2.9 billion due to the storm eleven people were reported to be killed in jharkhand due to heavy rains the system resulted in flooding rains from west bengal to east rajasthan in jharkhand latehar recorded 270 mm of rain and pratapgarh in rajasthan recording 240 mm rain along with sustained winds of 45 kmhunder active monsoonal conditions a low pressure area formed over the north bay of bengal near south bangladesh on october 8 on the following day the system intensified further into a well-marked low pressure area over the same region and later into a depression over the northern bay of bengal near the west bengal coast the system was then given the identifier land 02 by the imd the storm intensified further into a deep depression later on the same day moving in a north-northwesterly direction the storm interacted with an anticyclonic circulation which caused it to weaken rapidly into a low pressure area over west jharkhand on october 10the system produced heavy rainfall in east india and also caused caused 3 deaths in odisha by lightning and heavy rainfall kolkata was badly affected by the dangerous weather receiving rain upto 124.4 mm strong winds along with incessant rains slowed down traffic uprooted trees and collapsed buildings departure of flights from kolkata airport were canceled due to strong crosswinds at least 23 domestic flights were diverted due to the bad weather couple of accidental death also happened due to the rain an elderly person was electrocuted when he accidentally touched a lamppost a youth died after an uptrooted tree fell on him bangladesh was also affected by severe weather conditions torrential rain fell peaking at jessore receiving 109 mm in 24 hrs maritime ports of chittagong coxs bazar mongla and payra had been advised in bangladesh to hoist local cautionary signal number threeon 18 october the jtwc noted an area of thunderstorm activity located in the eastern bay of bengal as having a partially exposed low level center while located in a marginally favorable environment for further development later that day the imd upgraded the system to depression bob 05 as the system developed formative banding surrounding a center of deep thunderstorm activity despite being initially forecasted to intensify further the depression tracked into an environment with strong wind shear and failed to intensify making landfall on the odisha coast near paradip during the afternoon of 20 october after landfall the system remained near the coastline allowing moisture incursion from the bay of bengal to prevent rapid weakening initially tracking northwards the system soon recurved towards the northeast before weakening into an area of low pressure early on 22 october while located over northeastern bangladesh meghalaya and southern assamon 20 october the odisha state government declared the heavy rains caused by the storm as a state-specific disaster up to 25 blocks of eight districts in the state had received rainfall exceeding 135mm 5in with the kanas block of the puri distict recording rainfall of 274mm 10in heavy damage to homes were reported in balasore and bhadrak districts with an infant reported to have died in the former district following the collapse of a wallwest bengal was similarly affected by torrential rain with kolkata reporting 110mm 5in of rain and the bankura district reporting 279mm 10in in the east midnapore district a key bridge linking the seaside tourist destinations of shankarpur and tajpur collapsed due to strong waves and a storm surge of 1.5m 5ft from the bay of bengal as the storm passed through the area large portions of the jamura-shyampur village near the bridge were similarly reported to have been inundated by the storm surge in addition the town of cherapunji in meghalaya reported rainfall of 283mm 10in  among the highest reported in association with the depressionin bangladesh the ports of chittagong coxs bazar mongla and payra raised signal no 3 as a result of the strong crosswinds and heavy rainfall heavy rainfall was witnessed in the country with the highest total reported at gopalganj of 279mm 10in of rainwithin this basin a tropical cyclone is assigned a name when it is judged to have reached cyclonic storm intensity with winds of 62kmh 40mph the names were selected by members of the escapwmo panel on tropical cyclones between 2000 and may 2004 before the regional specialized meteorological center in new delhi started to assign names in september 2004 there is no retirement of tropical cyclone names in this basin as the list of names is only scheduled to be used once before a new list of names is drawn up should a named tropical cyclone move into the basin from the western pacific then it will retain its original name the next six available names from the list of north indian ocean storm names are belowthis is a table of all storms in the 2017 north indian ocean cyclone season it mentions all of the seasons storms and their names duration peak intensities according to the imd storm scale damage and death totals damage and death totals include the damage and deaths caused when that storm was a precursor wave or extratropical low and all of the damage figures are in 2017 usd
