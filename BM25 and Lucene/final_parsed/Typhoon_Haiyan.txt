of damage and loss of life appears to have been storm surge the major focus of devastation appears to have been on the east coast of samar and leyte with a particular focus on tacloban because of its location between samar and leyte and the large population in low-lying areas philippine department of the interior and local government dilg secretary mar roxas said the scale of the relief operation

damage to infrastructure throughout the region posed logistical problems that greatly slowed relief efforts though aid was flown into local airports most of it remained there as roads remained closed according to estimates on november 13 only 20 percent of the affected population in tacloban city was receiving aid with lack of access to clean water some residents dug up water pipes and boiled water from there in order to survive thousands of people sought to evacuate the city via c-130 cargo planes however the slow process fueled further aggravation reports of escaped prisoners raping women in the city prompted a further urgency to evacuate one resident was quoted as saying tacloban is a dead city due to the lack of electricity planes could only operate during the daylight further slowing the evacuations at dawn on november 12 thousands of people broke through fences and rushed planes only to be forced back by police and military personnel a similar incident occurred later that day as a us cargo plane was landingon november 14 a correspondent from the bbc reported tacloban to be a war zone although the situation soon stabilized when the presence of government law enforcement was increased safety concerns prompted several relief agencies to back out of the operation and some united nations staff were pulled out for safety reasons a message circulating among the agencies urged them to not go into tacloban for this reason on the west coast of leyte island residents in ormoc were fearing that the focus on tacloban city would leave them without aid though not as hard hit roughly 90 percent of the city was damaged or destroyed and supplies were running low hospitals in the city were either shut down or working at partial capacity leaving many of the nearly 2,000 injured in the city without medical assistance in nearby baybay lack of assistance fueled anger and incited looting for survivalin the coastal community guiuan which took the full brunt of the typhoon

restoring order in affected areaslooting intensified as slow recovery efforts forced residents to seek any means necessary to survive tacloban city administrator tecson john lim stated the looting is not criminality it is self-preservation the chicago tribune reported that some areas were on the brink of anarchy though interior secretary mar roxas denied such claims further complicating efforts to retain order was the lack of officers reporting for work in tacloban only 100 of the citys 1,300 police personnel reported for duty in alangalang just west of tacloban eight people were crushed to death after the walls of a warehouse collapsed during a raid on a government rice stockpile approximately 33,000 bags of rice each weighing 50kg 110lb were stolen warehouses were also raided in jaro and palo throughout the city of tacloban itself people began looting from homes as stores had been completely emptiedcondemnations of slow government action in the relief effort in response to the typhoon mounted days after the storm had passed media reports criticized the aquino administration for apparent lack of preparation and coordination among government agencies in the aid operation up until november 12 five days after the typhoon struck survivors continued to struggle with basic necessities such as food water and shelter while remote towns in leyte and samar were yet to be reached by aid the philippine government responded by saying that they have dealt with the tragedy quite well but the response had been slow due to the breakdown of the local governance in affected areas where officials and employees who were usually the first to respond in these events were victims of the typhoon themselves cabinet secretary jose rene almendras said that the national government had to take over despite logistical challenges and assured it is working toward providing aid the quickest way possible to the survivors the national government was also criticized for putting the responsibility of handling the dead to the bureau of fire instead to the department of health dr racquel fortun one of the forensic experts to go to the area three days after the typhoon insisted that handling of the bodies is a health matter and therefore a responsibility of dohone of the biggest controversies of typhoon haiyan is probably the number of the victims or the body count according to the philippine government sources the number of those killed during the typhoon ranges from 4,000 to 6,000 individuals while some sources claim that the body count reaches up to 15,000the philippines faced a humanitarian crisis days after the typhoon hit much of the visayas with 1.9 million homeless and more than 6,000,000 displaced in tacloban alone ninety percent of the structures are either destroyed or damaged while other cities such as ormoc are reporting similar damage the united nations fear that the possibility of the spread of disease is high due to the lack of food water shelter and medication casualties have been reported as a result of the lack of aid in affected areas and the number of dead is likely to riseas a result of the damage in tacloban and much of leyte thousands of people who once lived in the area left and made their way into less affected areas such as cebu and manila catbalogan reported that their population more than doubled after the typhoon with the influx of refugees into the city around 20,000 people have fled to manila as a result of the storm aircraft from the republic of china air force and republic of china navy vessel deployed with suppliesthe united nations said it was going to increase critical relief operations as a result of the devastation caused by the typhoon its manila office issued a statement that read access remains a key challenge as some areas are still cut off from relief operations unknown numbers of survivors do not have basic necessities such as food water and medicines and remain inaccessible for relief operations as roads airports and bridges were destroyed or covered in wreckage the united nations also began relief operations by this time however the severe damage to infrastructure hampered efforts

china sea with the philippines while the united states used to be an occupying power and currently has a mutual defense treaty with the islandschina was initially criticized for its meager contribution of us 100,000 cash each from the government and the chinese red cross to the typhoon victims which led to commentary about its disputes with the philippines earlier in 2013 the philippines sued china over the nine-dotted line commentators attribute this low amount to chinas intentions to isolate the philippines while strengthening its ties with the rest of southeast asia the move had mixed reactions from the public of china with some commending its decision while others such as the global times insisted that china should be a responsible power china later increased its contributions by us1.64 million in supplies  and sent its naval hospital ship peace ark for disaster reliefthe contributions of the united states was in contrast to that of china it gave the

struck and yeb sao the lead negotiator of the philippines delegation received a standing ovation at the conference when he declared a hunger strikein solidarity with my countrymen who are struggling to find food back home i will now commence a voluntary fasting for the climate this means i will voluntarily refrain from eating food during this cop until a meaningful outcome is in sightseveral delegates including american delegate collin reese joined him in fasting sixty people from climate action network an umbrella group of environmental non-governmental organisations also joined the hunger strikethe correlation between the increasing intensity of storms and the progression of climate change was discussed by climate scientists typhoons hurricanes and all tropical storms draw their vast energy from the warmth of the sea we know sea-surface temperatures are warming pretty much around the planet so thats a pretty direct influence of climate change on the nature of the storm said will steffen director of the australian national university climate change institute myles allen head of the climate dynamics group at the university of oxford said that the current consensus is that
