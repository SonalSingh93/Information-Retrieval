sts132  wikipedia sts-132 iss assembly flight ulf4 was a nasa space shuttle mission during which space shuttle atlantis docked with the international space station on 16 may 2010 sts-132 was launched from the kennedy space center on 14 may 2010 the primary payload was the russian rassvet mini-research module along with an integrated cargo carrier-vertical light deployable icc-vld atlantis landed at the kennedy space center on 26 may 2010sts-132 was initially scheduled to be the final flight of atlantis provided that the sts-335/sts-135 launch on need rescue mission would not be needed however in february 2011 nasa declared that the final mission of atlantis and of the space shuttle program sts-135 would be flown regardless of the funding situationsts-132 carried the russian rassvet mini-research module 1 to the international space station rassvet means dawn in russian the module was built by russian aerospace company energia rassvet arrived at the kennedy space center ksc aboard an antonov 124 cargo plane on 17 december 2009 at about 13:00 est after it was unloaded from the antonov the module was transported to an astrotech processing bay in cape canaveral to undergo preparations for launchan airlock and radiation heat exchanger to be used for outfitting the russian nauka module to be launched in 2012 a spare elbow part of the european robotic arm era and a portable work platform for science hardware for performing experiments in outer space were externally mounted on rassvet in its launch configuration russian and us cargo to be delivered will also be accommodated inside the module the volume for cargo and science inside mrm1 is 5 cubic meters rassvet was outfitted with iss standard grapple fixtures that allowed the module to be unloaded from the

launch and reentryin addition to the standard official flight kit ofk flown inside a locker on the mid-deck two light weight tool stowage assemblies were modified to fly memorabilia and then were stowed to the left and right of atlantis airlock in the shuttles payload baya compact disk cd containing the digital copies of all entries submitted to nasas space shuttle program commemorative patch contest was also flown aboard atlantis the contest was organized by the space shuttle program to mark the end of the shuttle era the winning patch was designed by mr blake dumesnil of hamilton sundstrand johnson space center a panel of nasa judges including shuttle program manager john shannon leroy cain and three other shuttle program managers including former astronaut john casper selected the winning patch from a pool of 85 entries by nasa employees and contractorsseventeen handcrafted beads made by nine different artists across north america were also on board atlantis during the sts-132 mission nasa teamed up with beads of courage inc an approved public charity to bring hope and inspiration to children coping with serious illnesses through the beads in space project the beads in space project is the brainchild of jamie newton an employee at the marshall space flight center in huntsville alabama the 17 beads weigh eight ounces and were selected after a contest organized by beads of courage that attracted 54 beadsalso on board atlantis was a 4-inch long wood sample of sir isaac newtons apple tree the piece from the original tree that supposedly inspired newtons theory of gravity along with a picture of newton were taken into orbit by astronaut piers sellers the wood is part of the collection of the royal society archives in london and was returned

commemorative patch contestthe mission markednasa arranged a tweetup to cover the launch of the sts-132 mission 150 people attended the event from more than 30 us states the district of columbia puerto rico belgium the netherlands new zealand and the united kingdom the tweetup participants met with shuttle technicians managers engineers and astronauts took a tour of the kennedy space center and viewed the launch of atlantisatlantis crew worked with several short-term experiments during their mission the shuttle transported new long-term experiments to the iss at the end of the mission atlantis returned some of the completed experiments from the issshort-term experiments includedthe missions external tank et-136 began its 900-mile 1,400km six-day journey across the gulf of mexico from nasas michoud assembly facility in new orleans louisiana on 24 february 2010 et-136 measured 154 feet 47m long and 28 feet 8.5m in diameter the solid rocket booster retrieval ship liberty star towed the et in the enclosed barge pegasus after docking in the turn basin at the kennedy space center the tank was offloaded and driven to the vehicle assembly building vab on 1 march 2010on 29 march 2010 workers attached et-136 to its solid rocket boosters a crane lifted the et into high bay no 1 inside the vab the day-long process was completed around 18:00 edt as the tank was bolted to atlantiss twin solid rocket boostersatlantis rolled out of its processing bay opf-1 around 07:00 edt on 13 april 2010 the shuttle entered the vab around 11:00 edt for attachment to its external tank and solid rocket boosters given that this was at the time believed to be atlantis final rollover for a mission the shuttle stopped for several hours en route to the vab allowing engineers and technicians to pose for photographs with the orbiter the rollover occurred exactly 25 years after atlantis first arrived at the kennedy space center after a cross-country trip from the shuttle factory in palmdale california the path to the rollover was without any incidents of major concern with only 22 interim problem reports iprs noted during atlantis flow since its return from the sts-129 mission in november 2009the transport canister containing the sts-132 payload arrived at pad 39a on 15 april 2010 ahead of atlantis rollover to the launch pad the canister was shaped like the shuttles 60-foot 18m-long payload bay packed inside it were the mrm-1 module and the cargo-carrying pallet icc-vldspace shuttle atlantis began its rollout to launch pad 39a at 23:31 edt on 21 april 2010 the complete shuttle stack and mobile launch platform were secured to the launch pads structure at 6:03 edt on 22 april 2010 the 3.4mi  trek took 6 hours and 32 minutes to complete the rollout was originally planned for the evening of 19 april 2010 but wet weather and thunderstorms on the space coast caused several delayssts-132's payload was installed in the shuttles cargo bay on 25 april 2010pad engineers preparing atlantis had noticed paint peeling from shuttles main payload the mrm-1 module although the problem was declared to have no impact on the operation of mrm-1 it holds a potential threat of releasing debris on orbit engineers also noted mrm-1 cycled its fire and smoke detector self test several times similar events occurred during atlantis sts-129 mission in november 2009 when shuttle and station crew were awakened consecutive nights by false depressurization and fire alarms that originated from the mrm-2 poisk modulean agency-wide flight readiness review frr was held at ksc in florida on 5 may 2010 to discuss atlantis launch preparations at the end of the review top nasa managers made the decision to officially set the launch for 14 may 2010 at 14:20 edt nasa held a post news conference to brief about the results of the frr the briefing was broadcast on nasa tv and was attended by nasas associate administrator for space operations william gerstenmaier space shuttle program manager john shannon and space shuttle launch director michael leinbach mr shannon mentioned that firstly ceramic inserts around atlantis windows and forward rocket pod were tested after an insert loosened during discoverys re-entry on sts-131 posing a potential impact threat the inserts had been re-installed on to atlantis using a thicker braided cord to reduce the chances of a backing out secondly it was mentioned that engineers had reviewed work to confirm that all systems on atlantis ku band antenna were in place the testing had been provoked after the failure of that communication system during sts-131 mr leinbach also acknowledged the skills and experience of the engineering teams and thanked the engineers who had successfully resolved hypergolic loading issues hypergolics are chemicals that ignite when they come in contact with each other the propellants are used in the reaction control system that steers the shuttle in spacea booster rocket segment that had first flown 25 years before on atlantis maiden flight sts-51-j was used to help fly sts-132 the aft dome on the left solid rocket booster that lifted off to support atlantis sts-132 mission first launched sts-51-j on 3 october 1985 including sts-132 18 of atlantis 32 flights were represented by the boosters segmentsatlantis astronauts traveled from johnson space center houston to the ksc launch site on 10 may 2010 to prepare for the launch the crew arriving in four northrop t-38 talon jets landed on the shuttle landing facility around 18:49 edtthe official countdown to liftoff started on 11 may 2010 after the countdown clocks at ksc were activated at 16:00 edt ticking backward from the t-43 hour markprogram managers completed the l-2 mission management team mmt meeting on 12 may 2010 at the end of the 18-minute-long meeting management team officially cleared atlantis for launch nasa held a pre-launch news conference to reveal the outcomes of the mmt and to brief the press on the upcoming launch the news conference was attended by chair pre-launch mission management team mike moses mike leinbach and sts-132 weather officer todd mcnamara the weather officer spoke of a favorable launch weather forecast due to a high pressure weather pattern and despite a low cloud ceiling calling a 70 percent chance of favorable conditions at launch time he further elaborated on the predicted weather conditions at the transoceanic abort landing tal sites zaragoza and moron in spain and istres france in case of an emergencythe space shuttle program mmt met at 04:15 edt on 14 may 2010 and gave a go to begin loading atlantis et with liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen the fuel tanking operation began on time at 04:55 edt and was completed within three hours at 07:56 edt with replenishment fuel being added throughout the countdowncrew preparations for the launch day began at 05:00 edt following an eight-hour overnight sleep an hour later they completed their final medical check ups crew suiting began around 10:00 edt and the astronauts departed for the launch pad at 10:30 edt at around 11:00 edt first commander ham ingressed the shuttle first and strapped into his seat followed by pilot antonelli mission specialists bowen sellers reisman and good in order inside the orbiter all six astronauts performed checks with ground controllers to verify that communications links work properly with all astronauts on board atlantis hatch was closed and latched for the flight inside the white room the closeout crew finished their job by pressurizing the crew cabin and checking for leaks before leaving the padlaunch day countdown procedures went without any major problems however atlantis encountered two minor issues the final inspection team looking for ice and frost buildup on the et had spotted a small stress fracture on an umbilical strut later during the post-launch news conference the chair of nasas pre-launch mission management team mike moses said that this was not unusual engineers also resolved any concerns about a loose ball bearing found near the shuttles payload bay days earlier the bearing was determined to likely be from a camera system and was ultimately ruled out as a concernthe launch of space shuttle atlantis occurred on time at 18:20 utc with launch commentator george diller saying that the shuttle was reaching the crest of its historic achievements in space powered flight conformed to the standard timeline with main engine cutoff meco occurring at 8 minutes and 32 seconds mission elapsed time met the external tank et-136 separated from the shuttle 15 seconds later at 8:47 met a further boost from the orbital maneuvering system oms engines was not required due to the nominal meco and atlantis settled into its planned preliminary orbit a subsequent nc-1 engine firing of about 26 seconds adjusted the orbital path of the shuttle to match that of the international space station iss by altering the shuttles velocity by about 41fts 12msnasa held a post-launch news conference with bill gerstenmaier alexey krasnov chief of the piloted programs directorate at the russian federal space agency mike moses and mike leinbach during the conference gerstenmaier made mention of a piece of space junk that could potentially have impacted atlantis planned arrival at the issmore than 39,000 guests including television host david letterman ex-apollo astronaut buzz aldrin and former nasa administrator michael griffin witnessed the launch the russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the head of the russian space federal agency anatoly perminov were also present at ksconce in orbit the crew opened the shuttles payload bay doors activated the radiators and deployed the ku band antenna successfully they also completed a checkout of the orbiters shuttle remote manipulator system srms the crew was also successful in downlinking all imagery from atlantis umbilical well cameras along with crew video of et-136 for review by imagery experts in the ground preliminary inspections showed that et-136 was very clean and had performed well during the ascent with only a few foam liberation incidents visibleit is worth noting that the launch of atlantis on sts-132 was supposed to be its last the mission patch depicted atlantis flying into the sunset as she retired and the space shuttle program patches on sale at the kennedy space center for the launch showed the years 19812010 for the program the programme guide magazine to the launch also cited the launch as the final flight of space shuttle atlantis however on its return atlantis was readied as a rescue shuttle for the at that time two remaining missions of sts-133 and sts-134 it could be launched on need if there was a problem and if not it would be stood down then later in 2010 nasa decided to fly the previously provision sts-135 mission and chose atlantis for the flight given that discover and endeavour were earmarked for sts-133 and sts-134 respectively the funding was found and a decision was taken to fly sts-135 as the final space shuttle mission with atlantis as the orbiter the sts-135 mission launched in july 2011 just over a year after atlantiss launch on the sts-132 missionthe crew members aboard atlantis began their first full day in space at 08:20 utc the day was primarily devoted to inspecting atlantiss thermal protection system using the shuttles robotic arm and the orbiter boom sensor system obss to look for any signs of launch damage before the thermal protection checkout began the crew encountered a problem with the laser dynamic range imager ldri and the intensified tv camera itvc due to a snagged cable in that systems pan and tilt unit as a result mission control decided to switch to the less-capable backup sensor system sensor package 2 a laser camera and a digital camera mounted near the end of the obss sensor package 2 required an additional light source such as daylight had a resolution of a few millimeters and could scan at about 2.5inches per second the crew followed late inspection procedures for surveying and images of the right wing the nose cap and much of the left wing were sent to the ground for detailed analysiscommander kenneth ham installed the center-line camera in the orbiter docking system ods to help him during atlantis approach to the iss down on the shuttles middeck good and bowen spent several hours checking out spacesuits and preparing them for transfer to the station reisman spent much of his day working with antonelli and ham on the tps survey he also assisted with the suit and spacewalk equipment checkouts the crew furthermore performed the ods ring extension that would connect the shuttles docking port to the stations harmony module the last portion of the crews day was spent preparing and checking out all of the tools to be used during the rendezvoustwo course correction burns were also performed on flight day 2 the first 10-second burn dubbed nc-2 was performed using the right-hand oms engine changing the shuttles speed by 8fts 2.4ms the burn raised both the apogee and perigee of the shuttles orbit by 1-mile 1.6km atlantis reaction control jets were again fired for a second time to execute the 8-second nc-3 burn which changed the shuttles velocity by about 2fts 0.61msmeanwhile mission control managers determined that the iss would not need an avoidance maneuver to avoid a piece of orbital debris updated tracking information showed that the iss and the debris would not pass close enough the following day to require any actionsnagged cable in the sensor package pan and tilt unitgarrett big g reisman in the middeck of atlantisblue and white part of earth as photographed by a crew membertony antonellithe sts-132 crew began their day at 07:20 utc and prepared to dock with the iss commander ken ham performed a series of rendezvous burns nh nc4 and ti to boost the orbit of atlantis to match with that of the iss the longest of these the 1-minute-24-second-long orbit raising maneuver or nh burn changed atlantis velocity by 132 feet per second and placed the shuttle into a new 212-by-145 miles 233km orbit a 63-second circularization burn known as nc4 boosted atlantis into a 214-by-210-mile 340km orbit at 11:40 utc with about 9 miles 14km separating the shuttle and the

positioned itself beneath the iss and began the 360-degree flip rendezvous pitch maneuver rpm as the shuttles underside rotated into view three iss crew members  oleg kotov using a camera with a 400mm lens and timothy creamer and soichi noguchi using two 800mm-lens cameras  took 398 photographs of atlantis belly as part of post-launch inspections of the thermal protection systematlantis docked with the iss pressurized mating adapter-2 at 14:28 utc as the two orbited 220 miles 350km over the south pacific ocean after docking the iss was reoriented by the small vernier thrusters on atlantis to minimize the risk of micro-meteoroid orbital debris mmod impacts upon the shuttle a series of leak checks were done on both sides of the hatch by the shuttle and station crews before the hatches were opened at 16:18 utc after a brief welcoming ceremony by the station crew atlantis astronauts received the standard station safety briefing the crew then got to work with initial transfers of equipment and supplies spacesuits were among the first items to go to the iss station crew member noguchi also transferred high-priority jaxa experiments to the kibo modulesellers and expedition 23/24 astronaut tracy caldwell dyson got to work on their joint task to relocate the icc-vld cargo pallet the duo used the stations robotic arm to transfer the pallet from atlantis to the stations mobile base system to prepare for the spacewalksin preparation for the following days spacewalk all atlantis crew members gathered for an hour-long spacewalk procedure review mission specialists reisman and bowen spent the night in the quest airlock as part of the overnight campout procedure to help them get prepared for the spacewalk the crewlock was depressurized from 14.7 to 10.2 psi the depressurization was required to avoid the formation of nitrogen bubbles in the astronauts blood which could result in decompression sicknessflying above the atlantic coast of spain and the gulf of cadiz atlantis

the spacewalk mission specialist sellers and station flight engineer caldwell dyson operated the robotic arm throughout eva 1 commander ken ham oversaw the extravehicular activitiesduring the spacewalk several problems were encountered the first of which was during installation of the sgant a slight gap was observed between the antenna dish and its mounting pole the spacewalkers loosened the bolts and used a higher torque setting which managed to close the gap to a smaller width the launch locks were left on the sgant to allow engineers on the ground to determine if the gap was acceptable or if more troubleshooting would be needed the second problem occurred during the installation of the sgant and was related to the command and control cnc computers during installation when steve bowen removed a cover from a connector the prime cnc computer detected an error and shut down the cap was a special cap which allowed the circuit for that connector to be closed so when it was opened the sensor detected an error the shut down of the cnc caused a 2-minute loss of communications the safeing of the computer also stopped the canadarm2 for a reconfiguration of the cameras being used during the spacewalk by both the robotic arm operators and observers on the groundthe spacewalk ended at 19:19 utc after reisman and bowen made an inventory of the tools they brought with them and made their way back into the quest airlock sts-132's eva 1 was the 237th conducted by us astronauts the second for reisman and the fourth for bowen it was also the 144th in support of iss assembly

schools had submitted their questions earlier by video the combined shuttle-station crew also shared a joint meal before the shuttle crew enjoyed two and a half hours of off-duty time starting at 11:05am edton flight day 10 the joint sts-132/expedition 23 crews awoke to begin the final hours of the joint docked mission the crews completed the final time-sensitive transfers of the mission which included scientific research samples that need to be kept cold once these transfers were completed the two crews held a joint crew news conference and took a crew photo and later prior to hatch closure held a mutual farewell ceremony after the ceremony the hatches between atlantis and the international space station were closed and a leak check was performed to ensure all the hatches were sealed properly the shuttle undocked from the iss at 15:22 utc a little more than 2 hours after the hatches were closed at the time of the undocking the two spacecraft were orbiting 220 miles 350km above the southern ocean southwest of perth australia the shuttle guided by pilot tony antonelli backed away from the iss to a distance of about 400 feet 120m at which time antonelli began conducting a fly-around of the space station so that crew members on both the iss and shuttle could get photos of both vehicles once the fly-around was complete the shuttle crew conducted two separation burns to move atlantis away from the space stationsts-132 blue shirts and expedition 23 crew members pose for a group portrait on the issham and kotov shake hands at the farewell ceremonyatlantis separates
