area and southern marylandthe north-south section of the masondixon line forms the border between maryland and delaware the border was originally marked every mile by a stone and every five miles by a crownstone the line is not quite due north and south but is as straight as survey methods of the 1760s could make it it was surveyed as a compromise solution to a century-long wrangle between the penn and calvert families of england if the chesapeake baydelaware bay watershed divide had been taken as the borderline delaware would be about half its current sizefinally although this has received less attention than other parts of eastern shore culture commercial east-west ties between delaware towns and maryland towns were culturally significant in colonial and early american periods despite the border line which largely cut through woods and swamps trade with philadelphia was conducted by overland routes to delaware towns like odessa then called cantwells bridge and smyrna then called duck creek agricultural products and milled grain were taken up the delaware river by shallop men in small vessels called shallops these cultural connections continue to this dayocean city is a modern
