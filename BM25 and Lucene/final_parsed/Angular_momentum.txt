angular momentum  wikipedia in physics angular momentum rarely moment of momentum or rotational momentum is the rotational equivalent of linear momentum it is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity  the total angular momentum of a system remains constant unless acted on by an external torquethe definition of angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector rp the cross product of the particles position vector r relative to some origin and its momentum vector p  mv this definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids or physical fields unlike momentum angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen since the particles position is measured from it the angular momentum of an object can also be connected to the angular velocity  of the object how fast it rotates about an axis via the moment of inertia i which depends on the shape and distribution of mass about the axis of rotation however while  always points in the direction of the rotation axis the angular momentum l may point in a different direction depending on how the mass is distributedangular momentum is additive the total angular momentum of a system is the pseudovector sum of the angular momenta for continua or fields one uses integration the total angular momentum of anything can always be split into the sum of two main components orbital angular momentum about an axis outside the object plus spin angular momentum through the centre of mass of the objecttorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum analogous to force the conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skaters arms are contracted the high rotational rates of neutron stars the falling cat problem and precession of tops and gyros applications include the gyrocompass control moment gyroscope inertial guidance systems reaction wheels flying discs or frisbees and earths rotation to name a few in general conservation does limit the possible motion of a system but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion isin quantum mechanics angular momentum is an operator with quantized eigenvalues angular momentum is subject to the heisenberg uncertainty principle meaning that only one component can be measured with definite precision the other two cannot also the spin of elementary particles does not correspond to literal spinning motionangular momentum is a vector quantity more precisely a pseudovector that represents the product of a bodys rotational inertia and rotational velocity about a particular axis in the simple case of revolution of a particle in a circle about a center of rotation the particle remaining always in the same plane and having always the same distance from the center it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum and treat it as a scalar angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear momentum thus where linear momentum  is proportional to mass  and linear speed angular momentum  is proportional to moment of inertia  and angular speed unlike mass which depends only on amount of matter moment of inertia is also dependent on the position of the axis of rotation and the shape of the matter unlike linear speed which occurs in a straight line angular speed occurs about a center of rotation therefore strictly speaking  should be referred to as the angular momentum relative to that centerbecause  for a single particle and  for circular motion angular momentum can be expanded  and reduced tothe product of the radius of rotation  and the linear momentum of the particle  where  in this case is the equivalent linear tangential speed at the radius this simple analysis can also apply to non-circular motion if only the component of the motion which is perpendicular to the radius vector is considered in that casewhere  is the perpendicular component of the motion expanding  rearranging  and reducing angular momentum can also be expressedwhere  is the length of the moment arm a line dropped perpendicularly from the origin onto the path of the particle it is this definition  to which the term moment of momentum refersanother approach is to define angular momentum as the conjugate momentum of the angular coordinate  expressed in the lagrangian of the mechanical system consider a mechanical system with a mass  constrained to move in a circle of radius  in the absence of any external force field the kinetic energy of the system isand the potential energy isthen the lagrangian isthe generalized momentum canonically conjugate to the coordinate  is defined byto completely define angular momentum in three dimensions it is required to know the angle swept out in unit time the direction of the axis of rotation and the sense right- or left-handed of the rotation as well as the mass involved by retaining this vector nature of angular momentum the general nature of the equations is also retained and can describe any sort of three-dimensional motion about the center of rotation  circular linear or otherwise in vector notation the angular momentum of a particle in motion about the origin of coordinates is defined asthis can be expanded  reduced  and by the rules of vector algebra rearranged to the formwhich is the cross product of the position vector  and the linear momentum  of the particle by the definition of the cross product the  vector is perpendicular to both  and  it is directed along the axis of rotation as indicated by the right-hand rule  so that the rotation is seen as counter-clockwise from the head of the vector conversely the  vector defines the plane in which  and  lieby defining a unit vector  in the direction of the axis of rotation a scalar angular speed  results wherethe two-dimensional scalar equations of the previous section can thus be given directionand  for circular motion where all of the motion is perpendicular to the radius angular momentum can be described as the rotational analog of linear momentum like linear momentum it involves elements of mass and displacement unlike linear momentum it also involves elements of position and shapemany problems in physics involve matter in motion about some certain point in space be it in actual rotation about it or simply moving past it where it is desired to know what effect the moving matter has on the point  can it exert energy upon it or perform work about it energy the ability to do work can be stored in matter by setting it in motion  a combination of its inertia and its displacement inertia is measured by its mass and displacement by its velocity their productis the matters momentum referring this momentum to a central point introduces a complication the momentum is not applied to the point directly for instance a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is in effect at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheels radius its momentum turning the lever about the center point this imaginary lever is known as the moment arm it has the effect of multiplying the momentums effort in proportion to its length an effect known as a moment hence the particles momentum referred to a particular pointis the angular momentum sometimes called as here the moment of momentum of the particle versus that particular center point the equation  combines a moment a mass  turning moment arm  with a linear straight-line equivalent speed  linear speed referred to the central point is simply the product of the distance  and the angular speed  versus the point  another moment hence angular momentum contains a double moment  simplifying slightly  the quantity  is the particles moment of inertia sometimes called the second moment of mass it is a measure of rotational inertiabecause rotational inertia is a part of angular momentum it necessarily includes all of the complications of moment of inertia which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their distances from the center of rotation therefore the total moment of inertia and the angular momentum is a complex function of the configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bitsfor a rigid body for instance a wheel or an asteroid the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the rotation axis versus the matter of the body it may or may not pass through the center of mass or it may lie completely outside of the body for the same body angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place it reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of massfor a collection of objects revolving about a center for instance all of the bodies of the solar system the orientations may be somewhat organized as is the solar system with most of the bodies axes lying close to the systems axis their orientations may also be completely randomin brief the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation the longer the moment arm the greater the moment of inertia and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given angular velocity in many cases the moment of inertia and hence the angular momentum can be simplified bysimilarly for a point mass  the moment of inertia is defined asand for any collection of particles  as the sumangular momentums dependence on position and shape is reflected in its units versus linear momentum kgms nms or js for angular momentum versus kgms or ns for linear momentum angular momentums units can be interpreted as torqueseconds workseconds or energyseconds an object with angular momentum of  can be reduced to zero rotation all of the energy can be transferred out of it by an angular impulse of  or equivalently by torque or work of  for one second or energy of  for one secondthe plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass is sometimes called the invariable plane because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system free from outside influences are considered one such plane is the invariable plane of the solar systemnewtons second law of motion can be expressed mathematicallyor force  mass  acceleration the rotational equivalent isor torque  moment of inertia  angular acceleration because angular acceleration is the time derivative of angular velocity this is equivalent to  rearranging into a form suitable for integration  and  and integrating with respect to timetherefore a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum known as angular impulse by analogy with impulse which is defined as the change in translational momentum the constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body before the torque began to act in particular if torque  then angular momentum  that is if no torque acts upon a body then its angular momentum remains constant converselyor angular momentum  moment of inertia  angular velocity and its time derivative isbecause moment of inertia is constant  is zero and  which as above reduces totherefore the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied torque about that center if angular momentum is constant  and no torque is applieda rotational analog of newtons third law of motion might be written in a closed system no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque hence angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant is conservedsimilarly a rotational analog of newtons second law of motion might be a change in angular momentum is proportional to the applied torque and occurs about the same axis as that torque since a torque applied over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum then if torque is zero angular momentum is constant as above a system with constant angular momentum is a closed system therefore requiring the system to be closed is equivalent to requiring that no external influence in the form of a torque acts upon ita rotational analog of newtons first law of motion might be written a body continues in a state of rest or of uniform rotation unless acted by an external torque thus with no external influence to act upon it the original angular momentum of the system is conservedthe conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing central force motion if the net force on some body is directed always toward some point the center then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center as all of the force is directed along the radius vector and none is perpendicular to the radius mathematically torque  because in this case  and  are parallel vectors therefore the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant this is the case with gravitational attraction in the orbits of planets and satellites where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary central force motion is also used in the analysis of the bohr model of the atomfor a planet angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms the conservation of angular momentum in the earthmoon system results in the transfer of angular momentum from earth to moon due to tidal torque the moon exerts on the earth this in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of earth at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day and in gradual increase of the radius of moons orbit at about 3.82centimeters per yearthe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation by bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis she decreases her bodys moment of inertia because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity if the angular momentum remains constant is conserved then the angular velocity rotational speed of the skater must increasethe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars like white dwarfs neutron stars and black holes when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars decrease in the size of an object n times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of nconservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint for example a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis and another about its precession axis also in any planetary system the planets stars comets and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conservednoethers theorem states that every conservation law is associated with a symmetry invariant of the underlying physics the symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is rotational invariance the fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conservedin astrodynamics and celestial mechanics a massless or per unit mass angular momentum is definedcalled specific angular momentum note that  mass is often unimportant in orbital mechanics calculations because motion is defined by gravity the primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it it is in effect stationary all bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way regardless of mass and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditionsfor a continuous mass distribution with density function r a differential volume element dv with position vector r within the mass has a mass element dm  rdv therefore the infinitesimal angular momentum of this element isand integrating this differential over the volume of the entire mass gives its total angular momentumin the derivation which follows integrals similar to this can replace the sums for the case of continuous massfor a collection of particles in motion about an arbitrary origin it is informative to develop the equation of angular momentum by resolving their motion into components about their own center of mass and about the origin giventhe total mass of the particles is simply their sumthe position vector of the center of mass is defined byby inspectionthe total angular momentum of the collection of particles is the sum of the angular momentum of each particle  expanding expanding it can be shown that see sidebarprove that  which by the definition of the center of mass is  and similarly for therefore the second and third terms vanishthe first term can be rearrangedand total angular momentum for the collection of particles is finally  the first term is the angular momentum of the center of mass relative to the origin similar to single particle below it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass m at the center of mass moving with velocity v the second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass similar to fixed center of mass below the result is general  the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass the particles need not be individual masses but can be elements of a continuous distribution such as a solid bodyrearranging equation 2 by vector identities multiplying both terms by one and grouping appropriatelygives the total angular momentum of the system of particles in terms of moment of inertia  and angular velocity   in the case of a single particle moving about the arbitrary originfor the case of the center of mass fixed in space with respect to the originin modern 20th century theoretical physics angular momentum not including any intrinsic angular momentum  see below is described using a different formalism instead of a classical pseudovector in this formalism angular momentum is the 2-form noether charge associated with rotational invariance as a result angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariantin classical mechanics the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane elementin which the exterior product  replaces the cross product  these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent this has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element defined from the x and p vectors and the expression is true in any number of dimensions two or higher in cartesian coordinatesor more compactly in index notationthe angular velocity can also be defined as an antisymmetric second order tensor with components ij the relation between the two antisymmetric tensors is given by the moment of inertia which must now be a fourth order tensoragain this equation in l and  as tensors is true in any number of dimensions this equation also appears in the geometric algebra formalism in which l and  are bivectors and the moment of inertia is a mapping between themin relativistic mechanics the relativistic angular momentum of a particle is expressed as an antisymmetric tensor of second orderin the language of four-vectors namely the four position x and the four momentum p and absorbs the above l together with the motion of the centre of mass of the particlein each of the above cases for a system of particles the total angular momentum is just the sum of the individual particle angular momenta and the centre of mass is for the systemangular momentum in quantum mechanics differs in many profound respects from angular momentum in classical mechanics in relativistic quantum mechanics it differs even more in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operatorthe classical definition of angular momentum as  can be carried over to quantum mechanics by reinterpreting r as the quantum position operator and p as the quantum momentum operator l is then an operator specifically called the orbital angular momentum operator the components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the lie algebra so3 of the rotation group so3 indeed these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum hilbert space see also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotationshowever in quantum physics there is another type of angular momentum called spin angular momentum represented by the spin operator s almost all elementary particles have spin spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture spin is an intrinsic property of a particle unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum all elementary particles have a characteristic spin for example electrons have spin 1/2" this actually means spin 2" while photons have spin 1" this actually means spin finally there is total angular momentum j which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields for one particle j  l  s conservation of angular momentum applies to j but not to l or s for example the spinorbit interaction allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between l and s with the total remaining constant electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum but can also have fractional valuesin quantum mechanics angular momentum is quantized  that is it cannot vary continuously but only in quantum leaps between certain allowed values for any system the following restrictions on measurement results apply where  is the reduced planck constant and  is any direction vector such as x y or zthere are additional restrictions as well see angular momentum operator for detailsthe reduced planck constant  is tiny by everyday standards about 10 j s and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects however it is very important in the microscopic world for example the structure of electron shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentumquantization of angular momentum was first postulated by niels bohr in his bohr model of the atom and was later predicted by erwin schrdinger in his schrdinger equationin the definition  six operators are involved the position operators    and the momentum operators    however the heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision therefore there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particles angular momentum it turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vectors magnitude and its component along one axisthe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute for example  for the precise commutation relations see angular momentum operatoras mentioned above orbital angular momentum l is defined as in classical mechanics  but total angular momentum j is defined in a different more basic way j is defined as the generator of rotations more specifically j is defined so that the operatoris the rotation operator that takes any system and rotates it by angle  about the axis  the exp in the formula refers to operator exponential to put this the other way around whatever our quantum hilbert space is we expect that the rotation group so3 will act on it there is then an associated action of the lie algebra so3 of so3 the operators describing the action of so3 on our hilbert space are the total angular momentum operatorsthe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between lie algebras and lie groups in mathematics the close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in noethers theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariantwhen describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field the canonical momentum p derived from the lagrangian for this system is not gauge invariant as a consequence the canonical angular momentum l  r  p is not gauge invariant either instead the momentum that is physical the so-called kinetic momentum used throughout this article is in si unitswhere e is the electric charge of the particle and a the magnetic vector potential of the electromagnetic field the gauge-invariant angular momentum that is kinetic angular momentum is given bythe interplay with quantum mechanics is discussed further in the article on canonical commutation relationsin classical maxwell electrodynamics the poynting vector is a linear momentum density of electromagnetic fieldthe angular momentum density vector  is given by a vector product as in classical mechanicsthe above identities are valid locally  ie in each space point  in a given moment newton in the principia hinted at angular momentum in his examples of the first law of motionhe did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the principiahowever his geometric proof of the law of areas is an outstanding example of newtons genius and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a central forceas a planet orbits the sun the line between the sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time this had been known since kepler expounded his second law of planetary motion newton derived a unique geometric proof and went on to show that the attractive force of the suns gravity was the cause of all of keplers lawsduring the first interval of time an object is in motion from point a to point b undisturbed it would continue to point c during the second interval when the object arrives at b it receives an impulse directed toward point s the impulse gives it a small added velocity toward s such that if this were its only velocity it would move from b to v during the second interval by the rules of velocity composition these two velocities add and point c is found by construction of parallelogram bccv thus the objects path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point c at the end of the second interval because the triangles sbc and sbc have the same base sb and the same height bc or vc they have the same area by symmetry triangle sbc also has the same area as triangle sab therefore the object has swept out equal areas sab and sbc in equal timesat point c the object receives another impulse toward s again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to d thus it continues to e and beyond the triangles sab sbc sbc scd scd sde sde all having the same area allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller the path abcde approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curvenote that because this derivation is geometric and no specific force is applied it proves a more general law than keplers second law of planetary motion it shows that the law of areas applies to any central force attractive or repulsive continuous or non-continuous or zerothe proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles that is the lines from s to the object are equivalent to the radius  and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of velocity  hence if the area swept per unit time is constant then by the triangular area formula  the product  and therefore the product  are constant if  and the base length are decreased  and height must increase proportionally mass is constant therefore angular momentum  is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocityin the case of triangle sbc area is equal to sbvc wherever c is eventually located due to the impulse applied at b the product sbvc and therefore  remain constant similarly so for each of the trianglesleonhard euler daniel bernoulli and patrick darcy all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of areal velocity a result of their analysis of keplers second law of planetary motion it is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matterin 1736 euler like newton touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his mechanica without further developing thembernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a moment of rotational motion possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand itin 1799 pierre-simon laplace first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation  his invariable planelouis poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation and elaborated on the conservation of momentsin 1852 lon foucault used a gyroscope in an experiment to display the earths rotationwilliam j m rankines 1858 manual of applied mechanics defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first timein an 1872 edition of the same book rankine stated that the term angular momentum was introduced by mr hayward probably referring to rb haywards article on a direct method of estimating velocities accelerations and all similar quantities with respect to axes moveable in any manner in space with applications which was introduced in 1856 and published in 1864 rankine was mistaken as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries however haywards article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the english-speaking world before this angular momentum was typically referred to as momentum of rotation in english
