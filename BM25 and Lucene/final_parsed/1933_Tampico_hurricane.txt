of tobago it moved west-northwestward through the lesser antilles passing about 14mi 22km south of grenada however the system was very weak and the island reported east winds of only 12mph 19kmh after entering the caribbean sea the depression intensified into a tropical storm on september18 and a day later it became a hurricane on september20 it passed to the south of jamaica while quickly strengthening at 0000utc on september21 a ship in the eye reported a barometric pressure of 929mbar 27.4inhg ordinarily the pressure reading would suggest winds of 153mph 246kmh however observations from the ship indicated the hurricane was smaller than normal with a radius of maximum winds of 8mi 13km as a result the peak winds were estimated at 160mph 260kmh or a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scaleafter peaking in intensity the hurricane continued to the northwest early on september22 it passed about 50mi 80km south of cozumel before making landfall on the yucatn peninsula its landfall intensity was unknown the atlantic hurricane reanalysis in 2012 suggested that the storm could have retained category5 status until landfall although local observations did not validate the theory in the original analysis of the season the landfall intensity was estimated at 105mph 165kmh as a compromise the 2012 reanalysis estimated the hurricane struck land with winds of 140mph 230kmh the cyclone rapidly weakened while crossing the yucatn peninsula and on september23 it emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 65mph 105kmh it quickly reintensified into a hurricane while moving toward the northeast mexican coastline at around 0000utc on september25 the hurricane made its final landfall just south of tampico tamaulipas with winds of 110mph 180kmh this
