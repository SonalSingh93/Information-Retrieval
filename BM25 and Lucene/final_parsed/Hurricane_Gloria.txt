hurricane gloria  wikipedia hurricane gloria was the first significant system to strike the northeastern united states since hurricane agnes in 1972 and the first major storm to affect new york and long island directly since hurricane donna in 1960 it was also the most intense category 4 hurricane that did not attain category 5 status until surpassed by hurricane opal in the 1995 atlantic hurricane season it was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that formed during the 1985 atlantic hurricane season originating from a tropical wave on september16 in the eastern atlantic ocean after remaining a weak tropical cyclone for several days gloria intensified into a hurricane on september22 north of the lesser antilles during that time the storm had moved generally westward although it turned to the northwest due to a weakening of the ridge gloria quickly intensified on september24 and the next day reached peak winds of 145mph 230kmh the hurricane weakened before striking the outer banks of north carolina on september27 later that day gloria made two subsequent landfalls on long island and later western connecticut before becoming extratropical on september28 over new england the remnants moved through atlantic canada eventually dissipating on october2before gloria made landfall the national hurricane center issued hurricane warnings at some point for the east coast of the united states from south carolina to maine hundreds of thousands of people evacuated and the hurricane was described as the storm of the century in general glorias strongest winds remained east of the center which largely spared locations from north carolina to new jersey and the passage at low tide reduced storm surge hurricane-force winds and gusts affected much of the path which knocked down trees and power lines this left over 4million people without power including the worst power outage in connecticut history related to a natural disaster the extended power outage on long island affecting 1.5million people at some point caused the long island lighting company to be shut down and be replaced with a public company fallen trees caused six of the storms fourteen deathsin north carolina high waves damaged many homes along the outer banks and caused heavy beach erosion high waves also damaged piers boats and docks throughout the mid-atlantic states flooding forced several highways to close and in pennsylvania thousands were forced to evacuate their homes the storm surge destroyed 48homes on long island while the winds damaged the roofs of many more widespread crop damage occurred amounting to about 20million 1985usd overall damage in the united states was estimated at 900million which was less than expected in neighboring canada the remnants of gloria caused minor power outages in new brunswick although confusion related to the storms arrival led to the creation of the canadian hurricane centrea tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on september15 based on data from satellite imagery it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on september16 near cape verde with an associated low-level circulation the next day the depression intensified into tropical storm gloria but there was no further intensification on september18 gloria weakened back to tropical depression status but re-intensified into a tropical storm on september20 during this time it moved generally westward due to a strong ridge to the north on september21 the hurricane hunters began flying into gloria to measure the storms intensity and the next day a flight observed winds of 78mph 126kmh at a height of 1,500ft 460m as a result the national hurricane center nhc upgraded gloria to a hurricane about 465mi 750km east-northeast of the lesser antillesafter having moved generally to the west gloria turned more to the west-northwest on september22 this occurred after tropical storms fabian and henri weakened the ridge on september23 gloria passed about 155miles 250km to the north of anegada the northernmost island in the lesser antilles it initially remained a minimal hurricane until september24 when it began quickly intensifying that day it became a major hurricane while passing northeast of the bahamas gloria developed a 10mi 16km wide eye surrounded by an eyewall and was producing the stadium effect at 0120utc on september25 hurricane hunters extrapolated a barometric pressure of 919mbar 27.1inhg and reported flight-level winds of 145mph 230kmh at the time this was the lowest pressure measured by reconnaissance aircraft over the northern atlantic ocean because there was little difference in the flight-level winds and the surface winds this was estimated to have been glorias peak intensity making it a category4 on the saffir-simpson scale however a preliminary reanalysis released in 2008 suggested peak winds of 155mph 249kmh at peak intensity the hurricane was located about 930mi 1500km southeast of cape hatteras in north carolina and had an eye diameter of only 8mi 13kmafter peak intensity gloria weakened while turning to the north moving around the western end of the ridge toward a cold front by september26 the winds had decreased to 90mph 150kmh just 30hours after its peak intensity later that day a buoy about 60mi 100km east of the center recorded a wave height of 46.9ft 14.3m which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an atlantic hurricane while accelerating toward north carolina gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105mph 165kmh making it a category2 hurricane at 0530utc on september27 the hurricane struck southern hatteras island in the outer banks after weakening further gloria passed just east of the delmarva peninsula and new jersey and interacted with a cold front its strongest winds remained on the eastern edge of the circulation and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics at 1600utc on september27 the hurricane made landfall with a broad and poorly defined center between john f kennedy international airport and islip new york with winds of 85mph 140kmh on western long island this was only about three days after henri struck the same general area as a much weaker tropical stormabout an hour after striking long island gloria made its final landfall in western connecticut near westport and proceeded to move through new england while weakening the nhc estimated that gloria became extratropical over maine early by 0000utc on september28 the storm continued to the northeast through atlantic canada passing south of greenland on september30 the extratropical circulation of gloria was last noted on october2 although the remnants later affected europeearly in glorias duration it threatened the northern lesser antilles prompting a hurricane watch and later warning for the area gloria also threatened the bahamas prompting that government to issue hurricane watches and warningswhile gloria was off the east coast of florida the nhc issued a hurricane watch from edisto beach south carolina to cape henry virginia which was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1000utc on september26 or 19.5hours before landfall by later that day a hurricane watch was issued for the rest of the eastern united states to eastport maine by two hours before glorias landfall on long island a hurricane warning was in effect for the same area after warnings were gradually extended further north officials anticipated higher winds and storm surge than what occurred due to the hurricane weakening as it approached landfallofficials in delaware and maryland declared a state of emergency before the storm struck and thousands of people from coastal communities evacuated to shelters schools closed in delaware and non-emergency workers were sent home along long island in new york hundreds of thousands of people evacuated their homes and a state of emergency was declared for several counties in connecticut about 20,000people evacuated along the coast and 7,300evacuated from neighboring rhode island residents also evacuated portions of cape codas gloria approached the east coast of the united states national hurricane center director neil frank called it the storm of the century due to its intensity and potential track over the densely populated region of new england such a track gathered the attention of many people and led to the evacuation of 380,000people along the coast from north carolina to connecticut in maryland officials implemented lane reversing to expedite the evacuation process a policy many other coastal states useofficials advised 95,000 citizens along the new jersey coastline an area that rarely experiences hurricanes to evacuate cape may countythe most vulnerable part of the state and among the most susceptible in the entire countrywould require 36hours in 2005 to evacuate the 100,000citizens and 900,000tourists that were commonly present during busy summer weekendsoffices and classes of harvard university closed only for the third time in the 20th century the previous cases being the new england hurricane of 1938 and the blizzard of 78 although glorias winds downed numerous trees and caused tens of thousands in damage in the area overall effects were much less than expectedat the same time gloria was making landfall on long island a storm warning was issued for western new brunswick and nova scotia across atlantic canada the threat of hurricane gloria caused many citizens to rely on american media for storm coveragehurricane gloria was a large hurricane that affected much of the northeastern united states gloria brought strong wind gusts which downed trees and left hundreds of thousands without power overall damage was estimated at 900million and there were fourteen deaths gloria was the first significant hurricane to affect new england since hurricane donna in 1960while offshore the eastern united states the hurricanes strongest winds were on the eastern periphery which reduced the winds over land in north carolina where gloria made its first landfall the strongest winds were 74mph 119kmh at a station near buxton at the cape hatteras national weather service office a gust of 87mph 140kmh was also observed there at diamond shoal light located offshore sustained winds reached 98mph 158kmh with gusts to 120mph 190kmh a peak storm surge of 5.9ft 1.8m was estimated at the neuse river a minimal surge of around 1.3ft 0.4ft occurred in neighboring south carolina where winds were below tropical storm force the highest rainfall related to gloria was 9.7in 250mm recorded in edenton north carolina high waves and storm surge resulted in heavy coastal flooding and beach erosion along the outer banks and several new inlets were created coastal flooding damaged several homes in the outer banks damage in the state was estimated at 8.1million including 2.4million in crop damage there was one death in north carolina when a man was struck by a fallen treethroughout much of the mid-atlantic the winds remained generally below hurricane force however winds reached 92mph 147kmh along the chesapeake bay bridge-tunnel in virginia and gusts to 89mph 144kmh in ocean city maryland the strongest winds in the region occurred after the center passed the area due to glorias fast motion there was minimal coastal flooding because the highest storm surge occurred during low tide generally less than 4.9ft 1.5m beach erosion was reported in both maryland and delaware the heaviest rainfall was west of the center statewide peaks included 9.17in 233mm at valley forge national historical park in pennsylvania 8.6in 220mm in holland virginia and 7.19in 183mm in annapolis maryland rainfall spread as far inland as west virginiahigh waves washed away 30ft 9.1m of a fishing pier in virginia beach virginia the rainfall caused minor flooding and high tides flooded coastal portions of the hampton roads region there was minor damage to trees roofs and signs in southeastern virginia the center of gloria passed about 30mi 48km offshore eastern maryland in ocean city waves of 15ft 4.6m severely damaged the boardwalk washing sand and debris a block inland downed trees left about 150,000people in maryland high winds forced the chesapeake bay bridge to close and there was little damage outside of eastern maryland high waves in delaware eroded beaches wrecked dunes and damaged oceanfront buildings and boardwalks storm flooding closed several highways including delaware route 1 damage was heaviest in sussex county although the storm damaged corn and soybean crops in northern delaware monetary damage totaled over 500,000 in the state in neighboring pennsylvania wind gusts reached 56mph 90kmh in allentown which knocked down many trees and left thousands without power heavy rainfall flooded many streams which closed or damaged several highways bridges and rail lines about 3,000houses were flooded forcing thousands to evacuatewhile just off the new jersey coast gloria produced strong winds peaking at 81mph 130kmh in ocean city where a gust of 101mph 162kmh was also reported in the town an f0 tornado was reported damaging a house rainfall in the state reached 6.00in 152mm at the charlotteburg reservoir near west milford heavy beach erosion occurred along the coast and several coastal towns sustained damage to boardwalks strong winds downed trees and power lines which damaged homes and cars one person was killed in long branch after touching a downed power linethough gloria moved quickly through the region it dropped moderate rainfall in locations including 6.04inches 153mm at baltimorewashington international airport in addition some unofficial reports in southeastern virginia indicated amounts of up to 8inches 200mm of rain because much of the mid-atlantic experienced the western weaker side of this hurricane damage was relatively light high winds downed numerous trees throughout the area leaving hundreds of thousands without power including 237,000 in new jersey 124,000 in maryland and 56,000 in virginia extreme rainfall in virginia resulted in 5.5million 1985usd in damage intense flood waters split long beach island in half for a period of timewhile making its second landfall gloria was accompanied by a storm surge of 6.9ft 2.1m at battery park the highest along its path the highest wind report was a gust of 85mph 137kmh at islip airport central park reported a gust of 51mph 83kmh rainfall in the state reached 8.04in 204mm at unadilla although was much less near the coast reaching 3.48in 88.4mm in central parkalong long island the high storm surge flooded hundreds of streets and caused heavy beach erosion high winds downed thousands of trees and damaged hundreds of homes causing widespread power outages about 1.5million people in the state lost power including two-thirds of the long island lighting company customers making it one of the worst power outages in the state there were four deaths on long island two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees there were also 14injuries in the region many of them due to downed tree branches in the new york mainland heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions rough waves damaged boats and docks along the hudson river unsettled weather contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the new york mainlandit is believed peak gusts reached 115mph 185kmh in eastern long island weather forecasters believe that damage across parts of long island indicated winds in the category three range as evidence of the damage received at macarthur airport glorias high winds caused significant damage across long island and southeastern new york the area hit the worst was eastern long island where high wind gusts blew thousands of trees into buildings and across roads the broadcast tower of wbli-fm toppled on bald hill in farmingville in addition the winds ripped roofs off of many buildings including hangars at the macarthur airport a hangar at the bayport aerodrome and the roof of the islip police station prolonged exposure to high winds and waves led to moderate beach erosion washing away several piers and docks the storm surge though relatively weak destroyed 48houses on the ocean side of the island glorias high winds left 683,000people in new york without power with some lacking electricity for over eleven dayswhile moving across new england gloria was a weakened hurricane that passed quickly through the area though still a large hurricane gloria hit at low tide resulting in low to moderate storm surges of 5feet 1.5m in groton connecticut 6feet 1.8m in new bedford massachusetts and 3feet 1m in portland maine the high waves caused heavy beach erosion in connecticut and rhode island the highest sustained winds were reports of 83mph 135kmh in waterbury connecticut and blue hill meteorological observatory in massachusetts although neither location is at sea level gusts peaked at 110mph 176kmh in chatham massachusetts and widespread areas across new england reported hurricane-force gusts it is estimated that hurricane-force winds occurred in connecticut massachusetts and new hampshire rainfall in the region peaked at 6.90in 175mm at borden brook reservoir in springfield massachusettsin connecticut gloria crossed from westport along the long island sound passed near hartford and exited into massachusetts wind gusts peaked at 92mph 148kmh in bridgeport and also reached 82mph 132kmh in hartford the winds downed thousands of trees many of which knocked down power lines this left about 727,000residents without power setting a record for the state related to a weather event high waves damaged or sunk hundreds of boats along the coast and several beachfront homes and docks were damaged light rainfall caused some minor flooding mostly in northwestern connecticut statewide there was about 6million in crop damage damage was heaviest near hartford and overall storm damage was estimated at 91million fallen trees contributed to two of the three deaths in the state as well as several other injurieshurricane-force gusts affected rhode island peaking at 92mph 148kmh in westerly the winds uprooted thousands of trees and caused widespread roof damage about 300,000people statewide lost power the greatest since the northeast blackout of 1965 coastal flooding was minimized due to the storm striking at low tide although were high enough in narragansett bay to damage docks and hundreds of boats damage in the state was estimated at 20million including the cost for restoring the power outages there were two deaths in rhode island one was related to a fallen tree and one occurred when a man was trying to secure his boatin massachusetts the hurricane moved from connecticut through the springfield area there was a small f1 tornado in middlesex county that damaged trees high winds knocked over thousands of trees and about 500,000people statewide lost power heavy rainfall caused stream flooding although the heaviest damage was from the winds the hurricane destroyed a radio tower in framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state along the coast the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds of boats across massachusetts damage was estimated at 61million including 6million from crop damageby the time gloria reached new hampshire it had weakened and was becoming extratropical although hurricane-force wind gusts were reported across the state on the top of mount washington wind gusts reached 127mph 204kmh the winds were strong enough to knock down large trees many over 50years old and 50ft 15m downed trees cut power lines which left 97,116people without power mostly along the coast fallen trees also damaged 16homes and several vehicles high rainfall damaged portions of north woodstock although water damage was generally minor there was one death in the state when an elderly woman was knocked over by the strong winds and died two weeks later there was about 2.5million in crop damage mostly to the apple crop in neighboring maine about 600,000people lost power due to the storm the most since the passage of hurricanes carol and edna in 1954 winds in maine reached 86mph 138kmh and the storm knocked down about 100power poles in addition to the downed lines downed trees blocked roads and damaged houses and cars the winds damaged roofs including the 127yearold spire of a church in groveville crop damage to the apple crop was estimated at 3million high waves along the coast damaged lobster traps and dozens of boats many of which were driven ashoreglorias high winds downed numerous trees across new england causing minor to moderate damage in the region connecticut received the worst of the hurricane where tree and structural damage was greatest along the coastline storm surge and strong waves washed away several fishing piers and some roadways were underwater during the storms passage new hampshire was affected only slightly from the hurricane and was limited to minor wind damage and localized flooding in maine damage was more severe where strong wind gusts ripped off roofs and uprooted hundreds of trees high winds across new england resulted in significant power outages leaving 250,000 in maine in all seven deaths occurred in new england many of which occurred from falling tree limbswhile the remnants of gloria were moving through atlantic canada they produced rainfall to the north of the track reaching as high as 4.53in 115mm in quebec the highest winds in the country were 58mph 93kmh peaking in the bay of fundy and to the northeast of newfoundland the remnants of gloria caused wind and wave damage in nova scotia wind gusts of 55mph 89kmh in fredericton new brunswick knocked down power lines affecting more than 1,800peopleon long island thousands were left without power for over a week until the last outages were restored two weeks after the storm on october8 the long duration without electricity forced hundreds of schools to close extended train times by six hours due to lack of powered crossings and price gouging on food ice and generators the lack of power led to a general disdain for the long island lighting company lilco which increased further when the company left the 40million 1985usd repair bill to the ratepayers citing the companys lack of hurricane insurance citizens quickly protested lilcos decision and within years the publicly owned long island power authority was formedresidents in both massachusetts and connecticut were also without power for up to one week which caused many food products to spoil due to lack of refrigeration the states brought in workers from other states although the delay in restoring the widespread outages caused many schools to remain closed in connecticut one man was electrocuted while repairing downed power lines about 477,000 connecticut light  power customers in the state lost power a record that was surpassed by the 754,000 who lost power during hurricane irene in 2011 later in 2011 a noreaster in october left over 830,000people statewide without power also breaking the record set by gloria in new hampshire most power outages were quickly restored and all were restored within six days in maine all power outages were restored in 11daysin maine most citizens remained indoors during the passage of the hurricane one police officer noted that even the criminals stayed home in the lewiston area restaurants experienced a great surge in business during the power outage after the storm several businesses stored frozen goods for houses without a generatorafter the storm president ronald reagan declared several counties in new jersey pennsylvania new york rhode island connecticut and massachusetts as federal disaster areas this declaration allowed those counties to apply for disaster assistancein canada the damage was less than expected but confusion related to the storm threat prompted environment canada to research the need for a dedicated hurricane centre in 1986 the following year the canadian hurricane centre was established with offices on both the atlantic and pacific coastsdue to its impact the name gloria was retired from the atlantic tropical storm naming list it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with grace in the 1991 season
