coriolis frequency  wikipedia the coriolis frequency  also called the coriolis parameter or coriolis coefficient is equal to twice the rotation rate  of the earth multiplied by the sine of the latitude the rotation rate of the earth 7.292110 rads can be calculated as 2tradians per second where tis the rotation period of the earth which is one sidereal day 23hr56m4.1s in the midlatitudes the typical value for  is about 10 rads inertial oscillations on the surface of the earth have this frequency these oscillations are the result of the coriolis effectconsider a body for example a fixed volume of atmosphere at latitude  moving at velocity  in the earths rotating reference frame in the local reference frame of the body the vertical direction is parallel to the radial vector pointing from the center of the earth to the location of the body and the horizontal direction is perpendicular to this vertical direction and hence in the meridional direction the coriolis force proportional to  however is perpendicular to the plane containing both the earths angular velocity vector  where  and the bodys own velocity in the rotating reference frame  thus the coriolis force is always at an angle  with the local vertical direction the local horizontal direction of the coriolis force is thus  this force acts to move the body along longitudes or in the meridional directionssuppose the body is moving with a velocity  such that the centripetal and coriolis due to  forces on it are balanced we then havewhere  is the radius of curvature of the path of object defined by  replacing  we obtainthus the coriolis parameter  is the angular velocity or frequency required to maintain a body at a fixed circle of latitude or zonal region if the coriolis parameter is large the effect of the earths rotation on the body is significant since it will need a larger angular frequency to stay in equilibrium with the coriolis forces alternatively if the coriolis parameter is small the effect of the earths rotation is small since only a small fraction of the centripetal force on the body is canceled by the coriolis force thus the magnitude of  strongly affects the relevant dynamics contributing to the bodys motion these considerations are captured in the nondimensionalized rossby numberin stability calculations the rate of change of  along the meridional direction becomes significant this is called the rossby parameter and is usually denotedwhere  is the in the local direction of increasing meridian this parameter becomes important for example in calculations involving rossby waves
