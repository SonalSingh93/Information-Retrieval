typhoon  wikipedia a typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops between 180 and 100e in the northern hemisphere this region is referred to as the northwestern pacific basin and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on earth accounting for almost one-third of the worlds annual tropical cyclones for organizational purposes the northern pacific ocean is divided into three regions the eastern north america to 140w central 140 to 180w and western 180 to 100e the regional specialized meteorological center rsmc for tropical cyclone forecasts is in japan with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest pacific in hawaii the joint typhoon warning center the philippines and hong kong while the rsmc names each system the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by typhoons each year only the philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the countrya typhoon differs from a cyclone or hurricane only on the basis of location a hurricane is a storm that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean and a cyclone occurs in the south pacific or indian oceanwithin the northwestern pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year like any tropical cyclone there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while the majority of storms form between june and november a few storms do occur between december and may although tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum during that time on average the northwestern pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally like other basins they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest with some systems recurving near and east of japan the philippines receive the brunt of the landfalls with china and japan being impacted slightly less some of the deadliest typhoons in history have struck china southern china has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region with a thousand-year sample via documents within their archives taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest pacific tropical cyclone basinsthe term typhoon is the regional name in the northwest pacific for a severe or mature tropical cyclone whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast pacific and northern atlantic elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone severe tropical cyclone or severe cyclonic stormthe oxford english dictionary cites urdu fn and chinese tai fung giving rise to several early forms in english the earliest forms -- touffon later tufan tuffon and others -- derive from urdu fn with citations as early as 1588 from 1699 appears tuffoon later tiffoon derived from chinese with spelling influenced by the older urdu-derived forms the modern spelling typhoon dates to 1820 preceded by tay-fun in 1771 and ty-foong all derived from the chinese tai fungthe urdu source word  fn violent storm cognate to hindi  tfn comes via persian from arabic  fn which may derive from the verb tfdan persian  to roar to blow furiously or arabic fa to turn roundthe chinese source is the word tai fung simplified chinese  traditional chinese  pinyin  cited as a common dialect form of mandarin d big and fng wind in mandarin the word for the windstorm is  dfng big wind and in cantonese  daai fung big wind the modern japanese word   taifuu is also derived from chinese the first character is normally used to mean pedestal or stand but is actually a simplification of the older kanji  which means typhoon thus the word originally meant typhoon windthe ancient greek  tuphn typhon is not unrelated and has secondarily contaminated the word the persian and chinese terms may have been originated by the greek word in the first placea tropical depression is the lowest category that the japan meteorological agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots 38mph 61kmh a tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained wind speeds exceed 34 knots 39mph 63kmh tropical storms also receive official names from rsmc tokyo should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots 55mph 89kmh then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm once the systems maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots 74mph 119kmh the jma will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoonthe highest category on its scalefrom 2009 the hong kong observatory started to further divide typhoons into three different classifications typhoon severe typhoon and super typhoon a typhoon has wind speed of 64-79 knots 73-91mph 118149kmh a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots 92mph 150kmh and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots 120mph 190kmh the united states joint typhoon warning center jtwc unofficially classifies typhoons with wind speeds of at least 130knots 67ms 150mph 241kmhthe equivalent of a strong category4 storm in the saffir-simpson scaleas super typhoons however the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the jtwc uses are based on a 1-minute averaging period akin to the us national hurricane center and central pacific hurricane center as a result the jtwcs wind reports are higher than jmas measurements as the latter are based on a 10-minute averaging intervalthere are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures atmospheric instability high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the troposphere enough coriolis force to develop a low pressure center a pre-existing low level focus or disturbance and low vertical wind shear while these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form normally an ocean temperature of 26.5c 79.7f spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres 160ft is considered the minimum to maintain the special mesocyclone that is the tropical cyclone these warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems a minimum distance of 500km 300mi from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesiswhether it be a depression in the intertropical convergence zone itcz or monsoon trough a broad surface front or an outflow boundary a low level feature with sufficient vorticity and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis about 85 to 90percent of pacific typhoons form within the monsoon trough even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low vertical wind shear of less than 10ms 20kn 33fts between the ocean surface and the tropopause is required for tropical cyclone development typically with pacific typhoons there are two outflow jets one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the westerlies and a second towards the equatorin general westerly wind increases associated with the maddenjulian oscillation lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins as the oscillation propagates from west to east it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemispheres summer season on average twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western pacific ocean near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south along the same meridian or line of longitude there is an inverse relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western pacific basin and the north atlantic basin however when one basin is active the other is normally quiet and vice versa the main reason for this appears to be the phase of the maddenjulian oscillation or mjo which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given timenearly one-third of the worlds tropical cyclones form within the western pacific this makes this basin the most active on earth pacific typhoons have formed year round with peak months from august to october the peak months correspond to that of the atlantic hurricane seasons along with a high storm frequency this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record one of the most recent busy seasons was 2013 tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest pacific ocean and concentrate around june and november in the northern indian ocean the area just northeast of the philippines is the most active place on earth for tropical cyclones to exist across the philippines themselves activity reaches a minimum in february before increasing steadily through june and spiking from july through october with september being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago activity falls off significantly in november although typhoon haiyan the strongest philippine typhoon on record was a november typhoon the most frequently impacted areas of the philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central luzon and eastern visayas a ten-year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30percent of the annual rainfall in the northern philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones while the southern islands receive less than 10percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones the genesis and intensity of typhoons are also modulated by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near-10-year frequencymost tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the westerlies when the subtropical ridge shifts due to el nio so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks areas west of japan and korea tend to experience many fewer septembernovember tropical cyclone impacts during el nio and neutral years during el nio years the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130e which would favor the japanese archipelago during la nia years the formation of tropical cyclones and the subtropical ridge position shift westward across the western pacific ocean which increases the landfall threat to china and greater intensity to philippines those that form near the marshall islands find their way to jeju island koreatyphoon paths follow three general directionsa rare few storms like hurricane john were redesignated as typhoons as they originated in the easterncentral pacific and moved into the western pacificwithin the western pacific rsmc tokyo-typhoon center part of the japan meteorological agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the western pacific since 1989 and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000 however each national meteorological and hydrological service within the western pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country such as the joint typhoon warning center for united states agencies the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa for interests in the island archipelago nation and the hong kong observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signalsthe list of names consists of entries from 17 southeast and east asian nations and the united states who have territories directly affected by typhoons the submitted names are arranged into five lists and each list is cycled with each year unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world typhoons are not named after people instead they generally refer to animals flowers astrological signs and a few personal names however pagasa retains its own naming list which does consist of human names therefore a typhoon can possibly have two names storms that cross the date line from the central pacific retain their original name but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon in japan people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar yearthe most active western pacific typhoon season was in 1964 when 39storms of tropical storm strength formed only 15 seasons had 30 or more storms developing since reliable records began the least activity seen in the northwest pacific ocean was during the 2010 pacific typhoon season when only 14tropical storms and seven typhoons formed in the philippines the most active season since 1945 for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country there was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the philippines in 1958 the 2004 pacific typhoon season was the busiest for okinawa since 1957 within guangdong in southern china during the past thousand years the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and 1670sthe highest reliably-estimated maximum sustained winds on record for a typhoon were those of typhoon haiyan at 195 miles per hour 314kmh shortly before its landfall in the central philippines on nov 8 2013 the most intense storm based on minimum pressure was typhoon tip in the northwestern pacific ocean in 1979 which reached a minimum pressure of 870 hectopascals 26inhg and maximum sustained wind speeds of 165knots 85ms 190mph 310kmh the deadliest typhoon of the 20th century was typhoon nina which killed nearly 100,000 in china in 1975 due to a flood that caused 12 reservoirs to fail after typhoon morakot landed in taiwan at midnight on august 8 2009 almost the entire southern region of taiwan chiayi countychiayi city tainan countytainan city now merged as tainan kaohsiung countykaohsiung city now merged as kaohsiung and pingtung county and parts of taitung county and nantou county were flooded by record-breaking heavy rain the rainfall in pingtung county reached 2,327 millimeters 91.6in breaking all rainfall records of any single place in taiwan induced by a single typhoon and making the cyclone the wettest known typhoon
