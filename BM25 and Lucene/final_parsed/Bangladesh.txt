ganges-brahmaputra delta the northwest and central parts of the country are formed by the madhupur and the barind plateaus the northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill ranges the ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the ganges local name padma or pdda brahmaputra jamuna or jomuna and meghna rivers and their respective tributaries the ganges unites with the jamuna main channel of the brahmaputra and later joins the meghna finally flowing into the bay of bengal bangladesh has 57 trans-boundary rivers making the resolution of water issues to be politically complicated in most cases as the country is a lower riparian state to indiabangladesh is predominately rich fertile flat land most parts of it is less than 12m 39.4ft above sea level and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1m 3.28ft 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems the countrys haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental sciencein southeastern bangladesh experiments have been done since the 1960s to build with nature construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt creating new land with dutch funding the bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s the effort has become a multi-agency endeavor building roads culverts embankments cyclone shelters toilets and ponds as well as distributing land to settlers it was expected that by fall 2010 the program would have allotted some 27,000 acres 10,927ha to 21,000 families with an elevation of 1,064m 3,491ft the highest peak of bangladesh is keokradong near the border with myanmarbangladesh is divided into eight administrative divisions each named after their respective divisional headquarters barisal chittagong dhaka khulna mymensingh rajshahi rangpur and sylhetdivisions are subdivided into districts zila there are 64 districts in bangladesh each further subdivided into upazila subdistricts or thana the area within each police station except for those in metropolitan areas is divided into several unions with each union consisting of multiple villages in the metropolitan areas police stations are divided into wards which are further divided into mahallasthere are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels and the administration is composed

recorded an air temperature below 0c 32f with a record low of 1.1c 34.0f in the north west city of dinajpur on 3 february 1905 a warm and humid monsoon season lasts from june to october and supplies most of the countrys rainfallnatural calamities such as floods tropical cyclones tornadoes and tidal bores occur almost every year combined with the effects of deforestation soil degradation and erosion the cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating the latter killing some 140,000 peoplein september 1998 bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern world history as the brahmaputra the ganges and meghna spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses 9,700km 6,000mi of road and 2,700km 1,700mi of embankment 1,000people were killed and 30million more made homeless 135,000 cattle killed 50km 19sqmi of land destroyed and 11,000km 6,800mi of roads damaged or destroyed effectively two-thirds of the country was underwater the severity of the flooding was attributed to unusually high monsoon rains the shedding off of equally unusually large amounts of melt water from the himalayas and the widespread cutting down of trees that would have intercepted rain water for firewood or animal husbandrybangladesh is now widely recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change natural hazards that come from increased rainfall rising sea levels and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as climate changes each seriously affecting agriculture water and food security human health and shelter it is believed that in the coming decades the rising sea level alone will create more than 20 million climate refugeesbangladesh is prone to floods tornadoes and cyclones also there is evidence that earthquakes pose a threat to the country and that tectonics have caused rivers to shift course suddenly and dramatically it has also been shown that rainy-season flooding in bangladesh on the worlds largest river delta can push the underlying crust down by as much as 6centimetres and possibly perturb faultsbangladeshi water is frequently contaminated with arsenic because of the high arsenic content of the soilup to 77 million people are exposed to toxic arsenic from drinking waterbangladesh ratified the rio convention on biological diversity on 3 may 1994 as of 2014 the country was set to revise its national biodiversity strategy and action

has 628 species of birdsseveral animals became extinct in bangladesh during the last century including the one horned and two horned rhinoceros and common peafowl the human population is concentrated in urban areas hence limiting deforestation to a certain extent rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats though many areas are protected under law a large portion of bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth the bangladesh environment conservation act was enacted in 1995 the government has designated several regions as ecologically critical areas including wetlands forests and

since the 1990s the 2014 national election was boycotted by the largest opposition party which argued that a free election could not be held without a neutral interim government the jatiyo sangshad is restrained from holding no-confidence motions floor crossing and free votes by article 70 of the constitution human-rights violations have increased due to the growing power of security
