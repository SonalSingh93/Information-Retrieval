apsis  wikipedia an apsis greek  plural apsides  greek  is an extreme point in an objects orbit the word comes via latin from greek and is cognate with apse for elliptic orbits about a larger body there are two apsides named with the prefixes peri- from  meaning near and ap- or apo- from  meaning away from added to a reference to the thing being orbiteda straight line connecting the periapsis and apoapsis is the line of apsides this is the major axis of the ellipse its greatest diameter for a two-body system the center of mass of the system lies on this line at one of the two foci of the ellipse when one body is sufficiently larger than the other it may be taken to be at this focus however whether or not this is the case both bodies are in similar elliptical orbits each having one focus at the systems center of mass with their respective lines of apsides being of length inversely proportional to their masses historically in geocentric systems apsides were measured from the center of the earth however in the case of the moon the center of mass of the earthmoon system or earthmoon barycenter as the common focus of both the moons and earths orbits about each other is about 75% of the way from earths center to its surfacein orbital mechanics the apsis technically refers to the distance measured between the centers of mass of the central and orbiting body however in the case of spacecraft the family of terms are commonly used to refer to the orbital altitude of the spacecraft from the surface of the central body assuming a constant standard reference radiusthese formulae characterize the pericenter and apocenter of an orbitwhile in accordance with keplers laws of planetary motion based on the conservation of angular momentum and the conservation of energy these two quantities are constant for a given orbitwherenote that for conversion from heights above the surface to distances between an orbit and its primary the radius of the central body has to be added and converselythe arithmetic mean of the two limiting distances is the length of the semi-major axis a the geometric mean of the two distances is the length of the semi-minor axis bthe geometric mean of the two limiting speeds iswhich is the speed of a body in a circular orbit whose radius is the words pericenter and apocenter are often seen although periapsisapoapsis are preferred in technical usagevarious related terms are used for other celestial objects the -gee -helion and -astron and -galacticon forms are frequently used in the astronomical literature when referring to the earth sun stars and the galactic center respectively the suffix -jove is occasionally used for jupiter while -saturnium has very rarely been used in the last 50 years for saturn the -gee form is commonly used as a generic closest approach to planet term instead of specifically applying to the earth during the apollo program the terms pericynthion and apocynthion referencing cynthia an alternative name for the greek moon goddess artemis were used when referring to the moon regarding black holes the term periapomelasma from a greek root was used by physicist geoffrey a landis in 1998 before periaponigricon from a latin appeared in the scientific literature in 2002the following suffixes are added to peri- and apo- to form the terms for the nearest and farthest orbital distances from these objectsfor the orbit of the earth around the sun the time of apsis is often expressed in terms of a time relative to seasons since this determines the contribution of the elliptical orbit to seasonal variations the variation of the seasons is primarily controlled by the annual cycle of the elevation angle of the sun which is a result of the tilt of the axis of the earth measured from the plane of the ecliptic the earths eccentricity and other orbital elements are not constant but vary slowly due to the perturbing effects of the planets and other objects in the solar system see milankovitch cycleson a very long time scale the dates of the perihelion and of the aphelion progress through the seasons and they make one complete cycle in 22,000 to 26,000 years there is a corresponding movement of the position of the stars as seen from earth that is called the apsidal precession this is closely related to the precession of the axiscurrently the earth reaches perihelion in early january approximately 14 days after the december solstice at perihelion the earths center is about  astronomical units au or 147,098,070km 91,402,500mi from the suns centerthe earth reaches aphelion currently in early july approximately 14 days after the june solstice the aphelion distance between the earths and suns centers is currently about  or 152,097,700km 94,509,100miastronomers commonly express the timing of perihelion relative to the vernal equinox not in terms of days and hours but rather as an angle of orbital displacement the so-called longitude of the pericenter for the orbit of the earth this is called the longitude of perihelion and in 2000 was about 282.895 by the year 2010 this had advanced by a small fraction of a degree to about 283.067the dates and times of the perihelions and aphelions for several past and future years are listed in the following tablethe following table shows the distances of the planets and dwarf planets from the sun at their perihelion and aphelionthe following chart shows the range of distances of the planets dwarf planets and halleys comet from the sundistances of selected bodies of the solar system from the sun the left and right edges of each bar correspond to the perihelion and aphelion of the body respectively hence long bars denote high orbital eccentricity the radius of the sun is 0.7 million km and the radius of jupiter the largest planet is 0.07 million km both too small to resolve on this imagethe images below show the perihelion green dot and aphelion red dot points of the inner and outer
