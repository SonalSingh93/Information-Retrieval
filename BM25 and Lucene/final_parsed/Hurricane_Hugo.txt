marshals service and the federal bureau of investigation fbi formed joint task force jtf 40 for operation hawkeye it also resulted in the first operational deployment of the national disaster medical system ndms when the new mexico-1 disaster medical assistance team dmat was deployed to assist in medical care needs of the stricken island three days after the storm hit the governor of the united states virgin islands alexander farrelly asked president bush for federal assistance in restoring order to the islandnational basketball association player tim duncan born in christiansted and a two-time nba mvp of the san antonio spurs attributed his basketball career to hurricane hugos destruction when tim was 13 years old he was a competitive swimmer who was considered one of the top united states competitors for the 400-meter freestyle however in the aftermath of hugo every swimming pool on saint croix was destroyed including the olympic-size swimming pool with no pool to practice in duncan turned to basketball tim duncan said im very fortunate to be where i am today without hugo i might still be swimming a resident of st croix recorded the hurricane and aftermath on a vhs video camera after being evacuated from the island days later the video footage was aired on wgal channel 8 from lancaster pennsylvania and picked up by nbc and aired as part of the nightly news this was credited as the first official eye witness footage shown on us national television about 20years later weather underground member jeff masters wrote and described his experience on saint croix during the hurricane noting that in some respects after 20 years there are many aspects of the society that have yet to recoverafter the storm governor carroll campbell said that the storm destroyed enough timber in south carolina to frame a home for every family in the state of west virginia an immense salvage effort was undertaken to harvest downed pine trees for pulpwood before they deteriorated to the point where they could not be used still standing timber that appeared usable for lumber and plywood frequently had annular separations of the rings that made them dangerous to saw and nearly impossible to cut into plies so they were also downgraded into pulpwood leading to such a drop in pulpwood prices that eventually much of the salvage effort ceased in south carolina which bore the brunt of the storm the federal emergency management agency fema was slow in responding united states senator from south carolina fritz hollings referred to the agency as a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses during a speech on the floor of the united states senate an investigation was launched which led to some reforms in fema procedures that helped the agency do a somewhat better job during hurricane andrew the next catastrophic hurricane to strike the united states however fema was criticized severely in 2005 for its similarly insufficient response to hurricane katrinadue to the extensive damage the name hugo was retired following this storm and will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane it was replaced with humberto in the 1995 season
