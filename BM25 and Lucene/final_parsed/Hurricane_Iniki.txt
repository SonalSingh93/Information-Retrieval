september 5 1992 during the strong 199095 el nio iniki was one of eleven central pacific tropical cyclones during that season it attained tropical storm status on september 8 and further intensified into a hurricane the next day after turning north iniki struck the island of kauai on september 11 at peak intensity it had winds of 145 miles per hour 233kmh and reached category4 on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale it had recorded wind gusts of 225 as evidenced by an anemometer that was found blown into the forest during clean up it was the first hurricane to hit the state since hurricane iwa in the 1982 season and the first major hurricane since hurricane dot in 1959 iniki dissipated on september 13 about halfway between hawaii and alaskainiki caused around 1.8billion 1992usd of damage and six deaths at the time iniki was among the costliest united states hurricanes and it remains one of the costliest hurricanes on record in the eastern pacific the storm struck just weeks after hurricane andrew the costliest tropical cyclone ever at the time struck floridathe central pacific hurricane center cphc failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches 24hours in advance despite the lack of early warning only six deaths ensued damage was greatest on kauai where the hurricane destroyed more than 1,400 houses and severely damaged more than 5,000 though not directly in the path of the eye oahu experienced moderate damage from wind and storm surgethe origin of iniki is unclear but it possibly began as a tropical wave that exited the african coast on august 18 it moved westward across the unfavorable atlantic ocean and crossed central america into the pacific on the august 28 the wave continued rapidly westward and remained disorganized conditions slowly became more favorable and as the convection concentrated around a center the wave was classified tropical depression eighteen-e on september 5 at this time the wave was located 1700miles 2700km southwest of cabo san lucas or 1550miles 2500km east-southeast of hilo initially the thunderstorm activity was not concentrated towards the center and thus the depression was not expected to intensify beyond minimal tropical storm strength the depression continued quickly westward and remained weak until september 8 when it slowed enough to strengthen to a tropical stormlocated at the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge iniki continued westward and strengthened over the unusually favorable central pacific it reached hurricane status on september 9 while 470miles 760km south-southeast of hilo the subtropical ridge which typically keeps hurricanes well away from the hawaiian islands weakened due to an approaching upper level-trough and allowed iniki to turn to the northwest with very favorable upper-level outflow and warm water temperatures iniki steadily intensified and attained major hurricane status on september 10 while south-southwest of the island chainas iniki turned to the north it continued to strengthen reaching a peak of 145mph 235kmh winds on september 11 while 170miles 270km south-southwest of poip on the island of kauai it continued rapidly to the north-northeast and made landfall on south-central kauai early on the 11th with sustained winds of 145mph 235kmh making iniki a category4 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the national weather service reported wind gusts of up to 175mph 280kmh the highest recorded wind speed from hurricane iniki was a 227mph 365kmh reading from the navys makaha ridge radar station according to the honolulu advertiser that remarkable figure was recorded at a digital weather station whose wind gauging equipment blew off after taking the measurement during the storm after crossing the island iniki rapidly accelerated north-northeastward weakened rapidly and was absorbed by a cold front as it lost tropical characteristics and became extratropical on september 13 about halfway between alaska and hawaiithe central pacific hurricane center cphc failed to issue tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the hurricane well in advance for several days prior to the disaster the cphc and the news media forecast iniki to remain well south of the island chain with the only effect being some high surf conditions some of the standard international computer models were indicating a northward turn towards the populated hawaiian islands but these were rejected by the cphc forecasters as late as early september 10 the cphc suggested that iniki would remain well to the south of the island group it was not until a special bulletin was issued by the cphc less than 24hours before landfallthat any warning was given to the publica hurricane watch was issued for kauai early on september 11 and was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day prior to inikis arrival in kauai 8,000people were housed in shelters many of whom remembered hurricane iwa 10years prior because schools were canceled traffic was light during the evacuation and streets were clear by mid-morning rather than sending tourists to public shelters two major hotels kept their occupants in the buildings during the storms passagethe cphc issued a tropical storm warning for oahu on september 11 which was upgraded to a hurricane warning later that day though not hit by the hurricane inikis large wind field caused nearly 30,000people to evacuate to 110public shelters in oahu public school buildings acted as shelters and were for refuge only meaning they did not provide food cots blankets medications or other comfort items roughly one-third of oahus population participated in the evacuation though many others went to the house of a family member or friend for shelter the execution of the evacuations went well beginning with the vulnerable coastal area for those in need vans and buses gave emergency transportation while police manned certain overused intersections the two main problems that occurred during the evacuation were lack of parking at shelters and exit routes for the coastlineshurricane iniki was the costliest hurricane to strike the state of hawaii causing 1.8billion in damage most damage was on the island of kauai where the storm destroyed thousands of homes and left a large amount of the island without power although oahu also suffered significant damage iniki also was responsible for six deathsthe hurricane nearly struck the central pacific hurricane center in honolulu had it hit there iniki along with hurricane andrew and typhoon omar would have struck each of the three national weather service offices responsible for tropical cyclone warnings within a two-month periodhurricane iniki made landfall on the south-central portion of kauai island bringing its dangerous inner core to the entire island upon making landfall the hurricane produced storm tides of 4.56feet 1.41.8m with some portions of the coastlines having high-water marks of up to 18feet 5.5m in addition strong waves of up to 35feet 10.5m in height crashed along the southern coastline for several hours causing a debris line of more than 800feet 250m inland because it moved quickly through the island there were no reports of significant rainfallhurricane inikis making landfall during daylight hours combined with the popularity of camcorders led many kauai residents to record much of the damage as it was occurring the footage was later used to create an hour-long video documentary commercial air service was suspendedhurricane inikis high winds caused extensive damage in kauai 1,421houses were destroyed and 63 were lost from the storm surge and wave action a total of 5,152homes were severely damaged while 7,178 received minor damage on the south coast hotels and condominiums received severe damage as well a few were restored quickly though some took several years to be rebuilt one hotelthe coco palms resort famous for elvis presleys blue hawaiinever reopened after the hurricane destroyed housing across the island left more than 7,000people homeless after the storms passageinikis high winds also downed 26.5% of the islands transmission poles 37% of its distribution poles and 35% of its 800mile 1300km distribution wire system the entire island lacked electricity and television service for an extended period of time electric companies restored only 20% of the islands power service within four weeks of iniki while other areas were without power for up to three months also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector though much of the sugar cane was already harvested what was left was severely damaged the winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut treesmost of inikis damage occurred in kauai on the island one person died when struck by debris while another lost her life when a portion of her house fell on her offshore two japanese nationals died when their boat capsized the reduced death toll was likely due to well-executed warnings and preparation more than 100injuries can be attributed to iniki though most occurred in the aftermath of the hurricaneamong those on kauai was filmmaker steven spielberg who was preparing for the final day of on-location shooting of the film jurassic park he and the 130 of his cast and crew remained safely in a hotel during inikis passage according to spielberg every single structure was in shambles roofs and walls were torn away telephone poles and trees were down as far as the eye could see spielberg included footage of iniki battering the kauai coastal walls as part of the completed film where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot members of the films crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roadsupon passing by oahu iniki produced tides of 1.73feet 0.50.9m above normal prolonged periods of high waves severely eroded and damaged the southwestern coast of oahu with the areas most affected being barbers point through kaena the waianae coastline experienced the most damage with waves and storm surge flooding the second floor of beachside apartments in all hurricane iniki caused several million dollars in property damage and two deaths on oahudamage on the island of hawaii was minor seas of 10ft 3.0m were reported along with 40mph 65kmh winds in honokhau harbor three or four sailboats were tossed onto the rocks and one trimaran at another harbor was sunk a beach near napoopoo on kealakekua bay lost some sand and to this day has never been the sameimmediately after the storm many were relieved to have survived the worst of the category4 hurricane their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days because iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed many kauai citizens insisted on paying in addition entertainers from all of hawaii including graham nash who owns a home on the north shore of kauai and the honolulu symphony provided free concerts to the victimsthe film jurassic park was being filmed at the time the sets used for the deleted scene where mr arnold goes to the shed to turn the power on were destroyed the cast and crew took shelter in a hotel looting occurred in the aftermath of iniki though it was very minor a group of army corps of engineers who experienced the looting of hurricane andrew just weeks before were surprised at the overall calmness and lack of violence on the island although electrical power was restored to most of the island approximately six weeks following the hurricane students returned to kauai public schools two weeks after the disaster kauai citizens remained hopeful for monetary aid from the government or insurance companies though after six months they felt annoyed with the lack of help the military effectively provided aid for their immediate needs though and help arrived before local officials requested aidamateur radio proved to be extremely helpful during the three weeks after the storm with volunteers coming from the neighboring islands as well as from around the pacific to assist in the recovery there was support of local government communications in lihue in the first week of recovery  as well as a hastily organized effort by local operators to assist with the american red cross and their efforts to provide shelters and disaster relief centers across kauaiin the months after the storm many insurance companies left hawaii to combat this state governor john d waihee iii enacted the hurricane relief fund in 1993 to help unprotected hawaii residents the fund was never needed for another hawaii hurricane and it was stopped in 2000 when insurance companies returned to the islandit is thought that hurricane iniki blew apart many chicken coops some possibly used to house fighting chickens this caused a dramatic increase in the numbers of wild chickens roaming kauaithe name iniki was retired due to this storm and was replaced with iolana within the central north pacific tropical storm list less than three days after iniki struck hurricane orlene struck the big island as a depression
