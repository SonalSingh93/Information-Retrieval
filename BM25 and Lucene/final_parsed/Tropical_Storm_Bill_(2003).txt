tropical storm bill  2003   wikipedia tropical storm bill was a tropical storm that affected the gulf coast of the united states in the summer of 2003 the second storm of the 2003 atlantic hurricane season bill developed from a tropical wave on june 29 to the north of the yucatn peninsula it slowly organized as it moved northward and reached a peak of 60 miles per hour 97kmh shortly before making landfall in south-central louisiana bill quickly weakened over land and as it accelerated to the northeast moisture from the storm combined with cold air from an approaching cold front produced an outbreak of 34tornadoes bill became extratropical on july 2 and was absorbed by the cold front later that dayupon making landfall on louisiana the storm produced a moderate storm surge causing tidal flooding in a city in the northeastern portion of the state the surge breached a levee which flooded many homes in the town moderate winds combined with wet soil knocked down trees which then hit a few houses and power lines and left hundreds of thousands without electric power two people drowned from rough surf in florida further inland tornadoes from the storm produced localized moderate damage throughout its path tropical storm bill caused around 50million in damage 2003usd and four deathsa tropical wave developed scattered convection in the central caribbean sea on june 24 while interacting with an upper-level low it moved slowly northwestward and remained disorganized due to strong upper level wind shear late on june 27 the convection became slightly better organized around a broad low pressure area though land interaction prevented further development as it moved towards the yucatn peninsula the area of low pressure became better defined over the central yucatn peninsula and after the system turned to the northwest convection quickly organized while located over the warm waters of the gulf of mexico on june 29 following the development of a closed circulation the system organized into tropical depression three while located about 40 miles 64km north of progreso yucatnthe depression quickly strengthened to become tropical storm bill later on june 29 operationally the national hurricane center did not begin issuing advisories until it attained tropical storm status initially the system resembled a subtropical cyclone with the strongest winds and deep convection located far from the center though it was classified tropical due to its tropical origins the storm steadily intensified as wind shear decreased and early forecasts from the national hurricane center mentioned the possibility of bill intensifying to hurricane status if the low level circulation organized beneath the area of deepest convection bill turned to the north-northwest and later to the north as it moved around the periphery of a ridge of high pressure on june 30 tropical storm bill reached a peak intensity of 60 miles per hour 97kmh one hour before making landfall in southwestern terrebonne parish louisiana it moved onshore at peak intensity and quickly weakened to a depression over land as it accelerated to the northeast bill remained a tropical cyclone as it moved through the southeast united states until it became attached to an approaching cold front on july 2 near the tennesseevirginia border the remnant extratropical storm was absorbed by the cold front on july 3 near central virginia while the remnant low pressure area continued northeastward until reaching the atlantic ocean later on july 3shortly after the storm formed the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch from the southern end of galveston island to morgan city louisiana as a more northward motion occurred the watch was canceled and replaced with a tropical storm warning from high island texas to pascagoula mississippi shortly before the storm made landfall the warning was discontinued between high island and cameron louisiana the national hurricane center briefly issued a hurricane watch from intracoastal city to morgan city but it was discontinued when tropical storm bill failed to strengthen prior the storm making landfall local national weather service offices issued flash flood watches and a tornado watch for large portions of the gulf coastthe threat of tropical storm bill caused 41oil platforms and 11oil rigs to evacuate this resulted in a loss of production of over 71 thousand barrels 11,300m of oil and 610million cubic feet 17,000,000m of gasthe american red cross mobilized workers and brought food water and other supplies to louisiana prior to the storms arrival at the request of louisiana emergency management officials the organization opened two shelters for residents in low-lying areas several floodgates in new orleans were closed before the storm made landfall and many universities and government offices were closed as well parishes along the coastline closed summer camps and prepared sand

moderate damage damage estimates totaled to over 50million 2003usd 65.1million 2017usd primarily as a result of flooding or tornadic damage throughout its path bill spawned 34 tornadoes ranking it fourteenth in the list of north atlantic hurricanes generating the most tornadoes the tornado outbreak was caused by wind shear moist air from the storm and cool air from an approaching cold front in spite of the large numbers of tornadoes most were weak and short-lived prior to forming the storm produced rainfall along coastal areas of mexico along the bay of campeche peaking at nearly 4 inches 100mm in yucatn and over 3 inches 76mm in campechethe outer bands of bill dropped light rain across southeastern texas peaking at 1.07 inches 27mm in jamaica beach sustained winds from the storm

southern half of alabama with isolated locations receiving over 8 inches 200mm due to wet conditions for months preceding the storm rainfall from bill led to flash flooding in many counties the deluge led to overflown rivers and streams and left several roadways temporarily impassable from high floodwaters saturated grounds and wind gusts of 30to 35mph 4856kmh downed numerous trees many downed trees landed on power lines which caused power outages for around 19,000people one downed tree destroyed a car and another damaged a roof of a house in lee county a man was required to be rescued after driving through high flood waters roadway flooding resulted in a few minor traffic accidents also the outer bands of the storm spawned an f1 tornado in crenshaw county early in its path it was narrow and damage was limited to downed trees two destroyed sheds and a few houses experiencing light shingle damage or damage from fallen trees later it expanded to reach a width of 1,800 feet 550m as it moved northwestward the tornado destroyed the roofs of two houses one of which experienced damage to its walls the tornado dissipated eight minutes after its 3 miles 4.8km path began resulting

receive any precipitation from the storm rainfall resulted in flooding in numerous locations around the atlanta metropolitan area leaving some roads impassable or closed the combination of moist air from the south cool temperatures from a cold front to the north and low pressures led to the development of supercells throughout georgia and south carolina several of which produced tornadoes an f1 tornado touched down 3 miles 4.8km north-northeast of pennington first it passed through a farm causing severe damage to two dairy sheds a john deere tractor and three metal storage buildings the tornado destroyed a hay barn a carport and a car inside the carport as well while also causing a tree to fall and kill one cow the tornado passed through a forested area where it toppled or sheared
