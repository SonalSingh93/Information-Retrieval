hurricane noel  wikipedia hurricane noel was the fourteenth named storm and sixth hurricane of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season noel formed on october 27 from the interaction between a tropical wave and an upper-level low in the north-central caribbean it strengthened to winds of 60mph 97kmh before making landfall on western haiti and the north coast of eastern cuba it turned northward and on november 1 it attained hurricane status the hurricane accelerated northeastward after crossing the bahamas and on november 2 it became an extratropical cyclone the canadian hurricane centre classified noel as a post-tropical storm until 2200 utc november 4 when it determined that it had lost all tropical characteristicsthe storm caused at least 163 direct deaths along its path primarily in hispaniola due to flooding and mudslides it was the deadliest north atlantic hurricane of the 2007 season after its transition to post-tropical noel became a very strong low pressure system causing flooding and wind damage over maine and eastern canada with heavy rainfall occurring across atlantic canada and snowfall over some areas of eastern quebec and labrador noels remnants subsequently combined with cyclone tilo a powerful european windstorm which later struck western europe and contibuted to the north sea flood of 2007 on the night of 89 novembera tropical wave exited the coast of africa on october 16 it tracked westward initially without organization and by october 22 was interacting with a trough while approaching the lesser antilles this caused a low pressure area to develop on october23 about 175mi 282km east-northeast of the northern lesser antilles the system continued westward with disorganized convection and was unable to develop further due to strong wind shear despite the shear convection increased as barometric pressures dropped in association with the organizing system turning west-southwestward the low passed over the united states virgin islands on october25 and just southeast of puerto rico the next day decreasing wind shear on october27 allowed the thunderstorms to increase over the center late on october27 after further organization the system developed into tropical depression sixteen at 0000utc on october28 about 215mi 346km south-southeast of port-au-prince haiti initially the national hurricane center nhc forecast the depression to track west-northwestward brushing southwestern haiti before moving ashore along south-central cubaupon becoming a tropical cyclone the wave was moving to the west-northwest under the steering currents of a high pressure area over the western atlantic ocean six hours after formation the center became difficult to locate though subsequently the depression became much better organized a large area of convection developed over the center with several rainbands to its south based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded the depression to tropical storm noel at 1815utc on october 28 while located about 150 miles 240km south-southeast of port-au-prince haiti after the center re-developed beneath the thunderstorms the storm quickly strengthened to winds of 60mph 97kmh and for several hours the cyclone was drifting to the south of hispaniola noel began to lose organization as a nearby upper-level low increased wind shear with the circulation becoming ill-defined as it further interacted with the mountainous terrain of haiti the storm crossed western haiti as a disorganized tropical storm on october 29 and subsequently began moving parallel to the northeastern coast of cuba while moving around the southwestern periphery of a weakening ridge on october 30 tropical storm noel made landfall near gibara cuba with winds of about 60mph 97kmhthe center of noel remained well-organized as it tracked through eastern cuba though its sustained winds quickly diminished to minimal tropical storm force early on october 31 it began drifting to the north-northwest in response to the approach of a short-wave trough from the west and the eastward shift of the mid-level ridge a large area of strong convective rainbands persisted to its east though due to increased upper-level wind shear there was little convection near the center shortly after 1200utc on october 31 noel emerged off the north coast of cuba and subsequently the cyclone became better organized as the circulation became better associated with the convection while located just off the north coast of cuba the motion of noel was nearly stationary though forecasters indicated it could have executed a small cyclonic loop on october 31 the canadian hurricane centre began tracking the stormconvection increased early on november 1 though initially the center remained to the southwest of the large area of thunderstorms at 1800utc that day the storm passed over the bahamian island of new providence near the city of nassau later that day the center tracked beneath the convection and noel accelerated northeastward in the southwesterly flow ahead of an approaching trough as it did so the center became elongated and distorted the cyclone maintained a large round area of deep convection with well-defined outflow and an eye feature became evident on satellite imagery based on reports from hurricane hunters the national hurricane center upgraded noel to hurricane status early on november 2 about 180 miles 290km north-northeast of nassau bahamas its convection began to wane as it moved through progressively cooler waters and as it lost tropical characteristics its wind field expanded by late on november 2 the inner core had substantially diminished and the thermodynamical structure of the cyclone had become asymmetrical and frontal as it began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone the national hurricane center issued the final advisory on hurricane noelearly on november 3 the extratropical cyclone attained winds of 85mph 137kmh and it gradually turned to the north-northeast as the center of noel approached nova scotia its large circulation produced strong winds across all of atlantic canada and new england and on november 4 it tracked across nova scotia and new brunswick at 6 pm ast 2200 utc november 4 as the storm was over labrador the canadian hurricane center declared that noel has lost all tropical characteristics and changed its designation from post-tropical to extratropical  the extratropical low continued to the northeast and made landfall over southwest greenland on the afternoon of november 5 bringing tropical storm force winds to the area the center dissipated over greenland later that night while its lowest barometric pressure as a tropical system was 980 mb on november 4 while located near labrador it registered a minimum pressure of 966 mbnoels remnants subsequently turned east and crossed the atlantic ocean combining with powerful european windstorm cyclone tilo over the norwegian sea several days laterthe san juan national weather service issued widespread flood and flash flood warnings and watches across puerto rico due to unsettled conditions officials advised residents to stay out of harms way and off the roadways a flash flood warning was issued for the entirety of the united states virgin islandsupon being classified as a tropical cyclone the government of haiti issued a tropical storm warning for the southwestern peninsula from its border with the dominican republic westward to port-au-prince by the time noel made landfall on haiti a tropical storm warning was either recommended or put in place for the southern coast of hispaniola from barahona dominican republic to port-au-prince haiti in haiti health care centers were advised to activate any emergency plans and medicine stocks were pre-positioned if needed residents in flood-prone areas were evacuated in the departments of sud-est sud grandanse nippes ouest centre and artibonie a red alert was issued while an orange alert was issued for nord-est nord and nord-ouest in the dominican republic 14,500people sought protection in shelters about 1,000 inmates were evacuated from a prison north of the countrys

tropical storm watch was put in place for the central bahamas a tropical storm warning was also issued for the northwestern bahamas there most government offices were closed during the passage of the storm on the island of andros residents took extra care in securing their boats as the storm tracked further to the northwest a tropical storm warning was put in place for the cuban provinces of guantnamo holgun las tunas ciego de vila and camagey the cuban institute of meteorology advised caution to residents due to previous heavy rainfall leaving grounds saturated several schools were

naval base in guantanamo bay stacked sandbags to protect structures in areas vulnerable to flooding namely those in low-lying terrainlate on october 31 the national hurricane center issued a tropical storm watch for southeastern florida as tropical storm force winds were expected to come close to the coastline coastal flood warnings high surf advisories and high wind warnings were posted for the coastline of florida north carolina and south carolina as noel churned offshore in the atlantic similar advisories were placed into effect from virginia beach virginia to ocean city maryland a coastal flood watch was issued for parts of new york including long island as the extratropical storm progressed north wind advisories were posted along the coast of new england and a winter storm watch was issued for northern maine the cape cod and islands division of the red cross opened a number of shelters on nantucket and along coastal massachusetts stores on cape cod were closed some of them boarded up windows and the us coast guard completed preparations and warned sailors of the stormprior to the arrival of noel into atlantic canada heavy rain and strong wind warnings were put in place for many locations in southeastern canada the canadian hurricane center issued hurricane-force wind warnings for waters to the southwest of the maritimes and gale warnings for waters elsewhere off of southeastern canada the halifax and montreal storm prediction centers of the meteorological service of canada issued high winds and heavy rain warning for all the areas of the maritimes newfoundland

he stated that it would be possible for public works to be able to get some pumps in to pump some of the water out however he also noted that in some areas that will be very difficult because you have ponds on both sides of the roadhurricane noel made its closest approach to florida on november 2 the interaction of noel and a ridge to its north produced strong gusty winds and high waves along the

with local rainfall amounts up to 2.14 inches 54mm as noels rain bands moved in from the atlanticas an extratropical cyclone noel interacted with high pressure building in from the northwest forming a tight pressure gradient that produced moderate winds along the outer banks of north carolina primarily on november 2 at cedar island sustained winds of 43mph 69kmh were reported along the coast from cape lookout northward gusts peaked at around 60mph 97kmh the storm produced strong waves flooding north carolina highway 12 with up to 5ft 1.5m of water and sand on november 3 about 6,000people lost

causing a bus accident with 10 injuries near saint-simon severe rains flooded the water treatment facility in perc quebec leaving the city under a boil-water advisory the city was also cut from the rest of the province as the heavy rains made a short section of quebec route 132 unusable in quebec just under 19,000 hydro-qubec customers lost power and activity was affected at several cte-nord plants including plants in the aluminum sector a major transmission line in the minganie region was damaged by the heavy wet snow and locally freezing rain causing blackouts and school closures one fatality related to the storm was reported in canada when a boat capsizedafter crossing atlantic canada noels remnants turned east and accelerated across the atlantic ocean before combining with powerful european windstorm cyclone tilo over the norwegian sea several days later subsequently on 89 november the storm surge from the combined system led to the north sea flood of 2007 leading to flooding in coastal belgium denmark germany the netherlands norway and the united kingdomthe government of the dominican republic distributed emergency supplies to 145,000families following the storm including food blankets mattresses and mosquito nets the relief aid amounted to about 3million usd the government requested a 200million usd loan from the inter-american development bank and the world bank on november 1 storm flooding led to an outbreak of leptospirosis in the dominican republic in the weeks following the passage of noel causing 25deaths and infecting 193others the government of haiti allocated about 1.5million usd for those affected by the stormdue to the extensive damage and number of deaths from noel the name was officially retired on may 13 2008 by the world meteorological organization during its annual meeting in orlando florida and will not be used again for any future north atlantic hurricanes it was replaced by nestor of the atlantic hurricane naming lists for the 2013 season but because it was not used in that season it could be used in the 2019 season
