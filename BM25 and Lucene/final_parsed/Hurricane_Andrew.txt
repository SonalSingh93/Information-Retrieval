hurricane andrew  wikipedia hurricane andrew was a category 5 atlantic hurricane that struck the bahamas and florida in mid-august 1992 the most destructive hurricane to ever hit the state it was the strongest in decades and the costliest hurricane to make landfall anywhere in the united states until it was surpassed by katrina in 2005 andrew caused major damage in the bahamas and louisiana but the greatest impact was felt in south florida with sustained wind speeds as high as 165 mph 270 kmh passing directly through the city of homestead in dade county now known as miami-dade county it stripped many homes of all but their concrete foundations in total it destroyed more than 63,500 houses damaged more than 124,000 others caused 26.5 billion in damage and left 65 people deadandrew began as a tropical depression over the eastern atlantic ocean on august 16 after spending a week without significantly strengthening itself in the central atlantic it rapidly intensified into a powerful category 5 hurricane while moving westward towards the bahamas on august 23 though it briefly weakened to category 4 while traversing the bahamas it regained its category 5 status before making landfall in florida on elliott key and homestead on august 24 with a barometric pressure of 922 mbar 27.23 inhg at the time of landfall in florida andrew is the fourth most intense hurricane to strike the united states several hours later the hurricane emerged over the gulf of mexico at category 4 strength with the gulf coast of the united states in its path after turning northwestward and weakening further andrew moved ashore near morgan city louisiana as a low-end category 3 storm after moving inland the small hurricane curved northeastward and rapidly lost its intensity merging with a frontal system over the southern appalachian mountains on august 28hurricane andrew first inflicted structural damage as it moved through the bahamas especially in cat cays lashing the islands with storm surge hurricane-force winds and tornadoes about 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago and there was substantial damage to the transport water sanitation agriculture and fishing sectors andrew left four dead and 250 million in damage throughout the bahamas in parts of southern florida andrew produced severe winds a wind gust of 177 mph 282 kmh was observed at a house in perrine the cities of florida city homestead and cutler ridge received the brunt of the storm as many as 1.4 million people lost power at the height of the storm in the everglades 70,000 acres 280 km of trees were downed while invasive burmese pythons began inhabiting the region after a nearby facility housing them was destroyed rainfall in florida was substantial peaking at 13.98 inches 355 mm in western dade county in florida andrew killed 44 and left a record 25 billion in damageprior to making landfall in louisiana on august 26 andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the gulf of mexico leading to 500million in losses for oil companies it produced hurricane-force winds along its path through louisiana damaging large stretches of power lines that left about 230,000 people without electricity over 80% of trees in the atchafalaya river basin were downed and the agriculture there was devastated throughout the basin and bayou lafourche 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane with 23,000 houses damaged 985 others destroyed and 1,951 mobile homes demolished property losses in louisiana exceeded 1.5 billion the hurricane caused the deaths of 17people in the state 6 of whom drowned offshore andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the gulf coast especially in alabama georgia and mississippi in total andrew left 65 dead and caused 26.5billion in damage it is currently the fifth costliest atlantic hurricane to hit the united states behind only katrina sandy 2012 ike 2008 and harvey 2017 as well as the sixth costliest atlantic hurricane behind the aforementioned systems and wilma 2005a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa on august 14 a ridge of high pressure to its north caused the wave to move quickly westward an area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the cape verde islands and on august 15 meteorologists began classifying the system with the dvorak technique the thunderstorm activity became more concentrated and narrow spiral rainbands began to develop around a center of circulation it is estimated that tropical depression three developed late on august 16 about 1,630mi 2,620km east-southeast of barbados embedded within the deep easterlies the depression tracked west-northwestward at 20mph 32kmh initially moderate wind shear prevented strengthening until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into tropical storm andrew at 12:00utc on august 17by early august 18 the storm maintained convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to 50mph 80kmh shortly thereafter the storm began weakening because of increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper-level low on august 19 a hurricane hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well-defined center and on the following day a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low-level circulation center remained observations indicated the barometric pressure rose to an unusually high 1,015mbar 29.97inhg the flight indicated that andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft after the upper-level low weakened and split into a trough the wind shear decreased over the storm a strong high pressure cell then developed over the southeastern united states which built eastward and caused andrew to turn to the west convection became more organized as upper-level outflow became better established an eye formed and andrew attained hurricane status early on august 22 about 650mi 1,050km east-southeast of nassau bahamas in the forecast issued six hours after becoming a hurricane the cyclone was predicted to make landfall near jupiter florida with winds of 105 mph 170 kmh on august 25 this underestimated both the strength and the speed of the storm which would eventually make landfall in south floridathe hurricane accelerated westward into an area of highly favorable conditions and began to rapidly intensify late on august 22 in a 24hour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by 47mbar 1.388inhg to a minimum of 922mbar 27.23inhg on august 23 the storm attained category 5 status on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale reaching peak winds of 175 mph 280 kmh a short distance off eleuthera island in the bahamas at 18:00 utc despite its intensity andrew was a small tropical cyclone with winds of 35mph 56kmh extending out only about 90 mi 150 km from the center after reaching that intensity the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle at 21:00 utc on august 23 andrew made landfall on eleuthera with winds of 160mph 260kmh the cyclone weakened further while crossing the bahama banks and at 01:00 utc on august 24 andrew hit the southern berry islands of the bahamas with winds of 150mph 240kmh as it crossed over the warm waters of the gulf stream the hurricane rapidly re-intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened at 08:40 utc on august 24 andrew struck elliott key with winds of 165mph 266kmh and a pressure of 926mbar 27.34inhg about 25minutes after its first florida landfall andrew hit just northeast of homestead with a slightly lower pressure of 922mbar 27.23inhg this barometric pressure made andrew the most intense hurricane to strike the united states since hurricane camille in 1969 and the strongest tropical cyclone to make landfall in florida since the labor day hurricane of 1935as the eye moved onshore in florida the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence and hurricane hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior however andrew weakened as it continued further inland and after crossing southern florida in four hours the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico with winds of 130 mph 210 kmh in the gulf of mexico the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north andrew steadily re-intensified over the gulf of mexico reaching winds of 145 mph 235 kmh late on august 25 as the high pressure system to its north weakened a strong mid-latitude trough approached the area from the northwest this caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest and winds decreased as andrew approached the gulf coast of the united statesat 08:30 utc on august 26 the cyclone made landfall about 20 mi 30 km west-southwest of morgan city louisiana with winds of 115mph 185kmh andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast falling to tropical storm intensity within 10 hours after entering mississippi the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on august 27 accelerating northeastward the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system and by midday on august 28 andrew merged with a frontal system while located over the southern appalachian mountains the remnants continued moving towards the northeast and it lost its identity later that day merging with the remnants of hurricane lester and a frontal zone over the mid-atlanticpost-analysis on andrew revealed that the storm was often stronger than operationally reported between early on august 22 and early on august 26 in real time the national hurricane center assessed its peak intensity as 150mph 240kmh which was upgraded to 155 mph 250 kmh in a post-storm analysis after the season ended however a 2004 paper by christopher landsea and others concluded that andrew became a category 5 hurricane near the bahamas on august 23 and reached maximum sustained winds of 175 mph 280 kmh the paper also indicated that andrew briefly re-intensified into a category 5 hurricane around the time of landfall in south florida early on august 24 the storm was found to have been slightly stronger while approaching louisiana but the landfall winds were decreased from 120 mph 195 kmh to 115 mph 185 kmhbahamas prime minister hubert ingraham who took office while the storm was active urged residents to take this hurricane seriously before the hurricane passed through the bahamas forecasters predicted a storm surge of up to 18ft 5.5m as well as up to 8in 200mm of rain on august 22 hurricane watches were issued from andros and eleuthera islands northward through grand bahama and great abaco they were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that day and on august 23 additional warnings were issued for the central bahamas including cat island exuma san salvador island and long island all watches and warnings were discontinued on august 24 advance warning was credited for the low death toll in the country a total of 58shelters were opened at churches government buildings and schoolsinitially forecasters predicted tides up to 14ft 4.3m above normal along the east coast of florida near the potential location of landfall rainfall was projected to be between 5 and 8in 130 and 200mm along the path of the storm in addition the national hurricane center noted the likelihood of isolated tornadoes in central and south florida during the passage of andrew on august 23 and august 24 several tropical storm and hurricane warnings were issued for much of central and south florida from titusville on the east coast to venice on the west coast included in the warnings were lake okeechobee and all of the florida keys by 18:00 utc on august 24 all watches and warnings issued were discontinued after andrew progressed into the gulf of mexicogovernor lawton chiles declared a state of emergency and activated about one-third of the florida national guard many residents evacuated most voluntarily from broward charlotte collier lee martin dade monroe palm beach and sarasota counties a total of 142shelters opened in these counties and collectively housed at least 84,340people in dade county alone 515,670people were ordered to evacuate as andrew was approaching an estimated 20,00030,000tourists were in the florida keys monroe county overall almost 1.2million people evacuated which contributed to the low number of fatalities despite the intensity of the storm many evacuees also checked into hotels with rooms completely booked as far north as ocala ultimately the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of florida mostly along interstate 95 united states coast guard vessels on or near the florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea government offices and public and private schools were closed from monroe county northward to st lucie county many colleges and universities in southeast florida also closed including barry university broward community college florida atlantic university florida international university nova southeastern university and the university of miami major airports such as the fort lauderdalehollywood key west miami and palm beach international airports closedshortly after the storm emerged into the gulf of mexico from southern florida the national hurricane center issued hurricane watches and warnings for the gulf coast of the united states beginning at 13:00 utc on august 24 after the initial hurricane watch from mobile alabama to sabine pass texas the watches and warnings were expanded to eventually include areas from mobile alabama to freeport texas all watches and warnings on the gulf coast were discontinued late on august 26 after the hurricane moved inland over louisianadue to the hurricanes threat workers fled oil platforms in the gulf of mexico while the coast guard moved their boats inland officials in mississippi suggested that about 100,000people evacuate the coastal counties shelters were opened in hancock and harrison counties though only 68people went to a shelter in the former gambling ships were moved into harbors and inland canals two run-offs for special legislative elections scheduled for august 25 were postponedin louisiana governor edwin edwards declared a state of emergency about 1.25million people evacuated from the central and southeast louisiana while approximately 60,000others fled parishes in southwest louisiana a mandatory evacuation from grand isle was ordered by mayor andy valence and the city council in new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy ordered the evacuation of about 200,000residents in the low-lying areas of the city nine shelters were opened in the city which were occupied by thousands of people in response to computer simulations showing that storm surge from a tropical cyclone like hurricane andrew could over-top the levees workers closed 111floodgates the louis armstrong new orleans international airport closed with jumbo jets being flown to other airports a total of 250members of the louisiana national guard patrolled the streets during the storm the red cross assisted with opening a shelter at the university of southwest louisianas cajundome in lafayette equipped to handle about 2,000peoplein texas about 250,000people evacuated orange and jefferson counties galveston city manager doug matthews advised residents to develop an evacuation plan in the event that the city chose to call for evacuations the city later decided against ordering an evacuation school was canceled on august 25 for beaumont port arthur and other areas of central jefferson county while schools were closed in dickinson high island hitchcock la marque santa fe and texas city on august 26 college of the mainland galveston college and texas am university at galveston were also closed emergency management crews in corpus christi began testing emergency generators and severe weather gear the comal county chapter of the red cross placed their disaster alert teams on standby and ready to respond if the hurricane threatened the corpus christi areathough andrew was a small tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan it caused extreme damage especially in the bahamas florida and louisiana the vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds although a few tornadoes spawned by andrew caused considerable damage in louisiana throughout the areas affected almost 177,000people were left homeless outside of the bahamas florida and louisiana effects were widespread although damage was minimal overall 26.5billion in losses and 65fatalities were attributed to andrew with some estimates ranging as high as 34billion andrew was the costliest hurricane in us history at the time but is now fifth following hurricanes katrina 2005 sandy 2012 harvey 2017 and ike 2008in the bahamas andrew produced hurricane-force winds in north eleuthera new providence north andros bimini and the berry islands the storm first struck north eleuthera where it produced a high storm surge at a small village in the northwestern portion of the island more than half of the houses were destroyed and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage one person drowned from the surge in lower bogue eleuthera and two others died in the bluff on current island the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses harbour island near eleuthera reported wind gusts of 138mph 222kmh  the strongest gust speed observed in the bahamas during andrews passage news reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on harbor islandandrew produced several tornadoes in the area at the capital city of nassau sustained winds reached 92mph 148kmh while gusts up to 115mph 185kmh were reported only minor damage occurred in nassau according to the bahamas red cross but on the private island of cat cay many expensive homes sustained heavy damage much of the northwestern bahamas received damage with estimated monetary losses reaching 250million a total of 800 houses were destroyed leaving 1,700 people homeless additionally the storm caused severe damage to the sectors of transport communications water sanitation agriculture and fishing four deaths in the country were attributed to the hurricane of which three were direct the indirect fatality was due to heart failure during the passage of the stormoverall andrew caused about 25.3billion in damage in florida making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state almost all of the damage in florida was caused by strong winds of the 44deaths attributed to the storm 15were direct fatalities while 29were indirectly caused by the storm it was later noted that if andrew had been slightly larger or had made landfall a few miles further north it would have significantly affected miami and fort lauderdale which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll an analysis by the american meteorological society indicated that unlike most hurricanes wind damage from andrew was mostly north of the geometric center and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm some officials in florida considered andrew the worst storm in the state since the labor day hurricane in 1935 the storm surge from andrew caused more than 500million in losses to boats and buildings at the height of the storm more than 1.4million people lost electricity and another 150,000were without telephone service it is estimated that throughout florida the storm damaged 101,241homes and destroyed approximately 63,000others  the vast majority in dade county  with about 175,000people rendered homeless in addition to homes the storm damaged or destroyed 82,000businesses 32,900 acres 13,300ha of farmland 31public schools 59health facilitieshospitals 9,500traffic signals 3,300mi 5,300km of power lines and 3,000watermains approximately 20million cubic yards 15million m of debris left by the storm were disposed oftides were generally between 4 to 6ft 1.2 to 1.8m above normal in the biscayne bay area though near the burger king international headquarters tides reached as high as 16.9ft 5.2m above normal storm surge on the west coast was widespread but generally light with a peak height of 6ft 1.8m in everglades city and goodland strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area stretching from key largo to the miami beach area a house near perrine initially reported a wind gust of 212mph 341kmh before the structure and instrument were destroyed this measurement was reduced to 177mph 285kmh after wind-tunnel testing at the virginia polytechnic institute and state university of the same type of anemometer revealed a 16.5% error several other anemometers measuring the highest wind speeds on land were destroyed or failed at the national hurricane center building in coral gables sustained winds of 115mph 185kmh and gusts to 164mph 264kmh were measured before the anemometer failed the highest sustained wind speed for the storm was 146mph 235kmh recorded at the turkey point nuclear generating station before instruments also failed there in key largo a 13-minute wind speed of 114mph 183kmh was reported tropical storm force winds reached as far north as west palm beach on the west coast of florida sustained winds remained just below tropical storm force on marco island though a wind gust of 100mph 160kmh was reported in collier county rainfall was generally light possibly as a result of the storms relatively fast movement overall precipitation from andrew peaked at nearly 14in 360mm in western dade county heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic with precipitation reported as far north as central floridaalthough effects from andrew were catastrophic the extent of damage was limited mainly from kendall to key largo due to the small wind field of the storm the hurricane destroyed 90% of mobile homes in the county including 99% of mobile homes in homestead at the homestead air force base most of the 2,000buildings on the base were severely damaged or rendered unusable damage to the base was extensive enough that it was recommended for closure nearby in the small town of florida city over 120homes were demolished and 700others were damaged while a number of other buildings were damaged beyond repair including city hall further north damage to poorly constructed homes in communities such as country walk and saga bay resembled that of an f3 tornado as winds in the area were estimated to have ranged from 130 to 150mph 210 to 240kmh below the threshold for an f3 tornado four of the five condominiums at naranja lakes were destroyed the cutler ridge mall suffered severe wind and water damage after the storm significant looting was reported at that location more than 50streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines agriculture suffered extensively as well with an 85% loss to fruit crops such as avocados limes and mangoes crop damage in dade county totaled about 509million the county suffered the vast majority of the damage from the hurricane totaling approximately 25billion andrew left at least 40deaths in the county 15direct and 25indirectelsewhere effects were relatively minimal except in broward monroe and collier counties in broward county on the north side of the storms path impact in several municipalities was primarily limited to downed trees several of which fell onto roads and power lines in pembroke park one of the worst impacted cities in the county approximately 260mobile homes were damaged storm surge left coastal flooding in some areas especially along state roads a1a and 858 property damage reached about 100million and three fatalities were reported in broward county in everglades national park and biscayne national park more than 25% of trees were damaged or destroyed including one-fourth of the royal palms and one-third of the pine trees in the former in addition to the damage at everglades national park effects in monroe county were significant especially in the upper florida keys strong winds damaged billboards awnings commercial signs several boats planes trees and 1,500homes with 300of those becoming uninhabitable damage in that county was about 131million in collier county to the north of the storms path sustained winds up to 98mph 158kmh were observed in chokoloskee storm surge flooded low-lying areas particularly in goodland everglades city and marco island many boats were damaged or destroyed by the rough seas and strong winds the storm destroyed 80mobile homes and severely damaged 400others property damage in the county reached about 30millionafter hitting florida andrew moved across the gulf of mexico and made landfall about 23mi 37km west-southwest of morgan city in south-central louisiana at landfall the maximum sustained winds were 115mph 185kmh the highest sustained wind speed observed was 96mph 154kmh while a wind gust as strong as 120mph 190kmh was recorded both measurements were taken at the fire station in berwick as it moved ashore the hurricane produced storm tides of at least 8ft 2.4m above normal causing flooding along the coast from vermilion bay to lake borgne off louisiana a group of six fishermen from alabama drowned heavy rains accompanied the storms passage through the state peaking at 11.02in 280mm in robert river flooding was also reported with the tangipahoa river in robert cresting at 3.8ft 1.2m above flood stage before making landfall andrew spawned an f3 tornado in laplace which killed two people and injuring 32 the tornado was on the ground for about 10minutes during which it damaged or destroyed 163structures leaving 60families homeless collectively 14tornadoes were reported in the parishes of ascension iberville pointe coupee and avoyelles as well as in baton rougealong the louisiana coastline impact largely resembled that of a category 2 hurricane damage was heaviest in st mary parish about 32mi 51km east of where andrew made landfall twenty-six schools were impacted with damage totaling 2.6million berwick high school sheltering about 2,000people was deroofed during the storm generally single-family homes fared well with most losing only roofing shingles though others suffered severe damage after large trees fell on them in cypremort point state park several mobile homes were destroyed houses in berwick morgan city and patterson suffered major damage throughout the parish 1,367dwellings were destroyed 2,028were severely damaged and 4,770others were impacted to a minor degree property damage alone in st mary parish reached approximately 150million iberia parish was also among the most severely impacted parishes two schools collectively sheltering about 3,600people in jeanerette and new iberia lost their roofs one death occurred in the parish due to electrocution a total of 407residences were demolished 2,528others were extensively damaged and 3,526others were inflicted with minor damage overall the parish suffered 125million in property damage while an additional 200million in damage was inflicted on sugar cropsacross the state the hurricane damaged 23,000homes and destroyed 985homes and 1,951mobile homes private property damage was estimated at 1billion the high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops estimated at 289million in damage strong winds also left at least 230,000people without electricity during the storms passage upwelling occurred in the atchafalaya basin and bayou lafourche killing 187million freshwater fish damage to the fishing industry was estimated at 266million overall losses in the state of louisiana reached approximately 1.56billion a total of 17deaths occurred in louisiana 8directly and 9from indirect causes at least 75injuries were reportedwhile andrew was entering the gulf of mexico oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore drilling platforms the storm damaged 241oil and gas facilities and toppled 33platforms off the coast of louisiana causing significant disruptions in production additionally 83pipeline segments suffered damage to some degree the oil industry lost about 12million per day in the days following andrew and 4million daily by three weeks later initially a production loss of 240,000 to 270,000barrels per day occurred  approximately one-third of production throughout the gulf of mexico overall hurricane andrew caused about 500million in damage to oil facilitiesas andrew moved ashore in louisiana its outer fringes produced a storm tide of about 1.3ft 0.40m in sabine pass texas winds were generally light in the state reaching 30mph 48kmh in port arthur as andrew crossed into mississippi 3severe thunderstorm warnings 21tornado warnings and 16flood warnings were issued funnel clouds were observed near the path of the storm along with 26tornadoes structural damage was generally minimal occurring from the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms one tornado in kemper county destroyed a mobile home while another twister in lauderdale county demolished a mobile home damaged five other dwellings and injured four people additionally a possible tornado damaged a home and two trailers in lawrence county strong winds knocked down trees in the southwestern portion of the state much of mississippi received 3 to 5in 76 to 127mm of rain while areas near the southwest corner of the state observed over 7in 180mm of precipitation with a peak of 9.30in 236mm at sumrall flooding was mostly limited to the inundation of minor roads and low-lying areas in several countiesin alabama precipitation amounts in the state peaked at 4.71in 120mm in aliceville the rainfall caused flooding in low-lying areas and creeks covering a few county roads but not entering many houses or businesses along the coast the storm produced flooding and high tides along dauphin island high tides left severe beach erosion with portions of the island losing up to 30ft 9.1m of sand three damaging tornadoes occurred in the state the most damaging tornado was spawned in elmore county and moved from an area northeast of montgomery to the south of wetumpka and briefly lifted during its 0.5mi 0.80km track the tornado destroyed 2homes and damaged 18homes 1mobile home 2barns and 1vehicle one person was injured by the twister sustained winds in the state were below tropical storm force though a wind gust of 41 mph 67 kmh was observed in huntsville although 48 counties in alabama reported wind damage impact across the state was generally minortropical storm force wind gusts and damaging tornadoes extended eastward into georgia several counties in the northwest and west-central portions of the state reported downed trees and tree limbs and fallen power lines causing scattered power outages but structural damage was generally minor in carroll county several dwellings and barns were damaged with one mobile home destroyed at the columbus metropolitan airport buildings billboards and signs were damaged additionally a tornado in floyd county near rome snapped and uprooted several trees damaged several fences and homes and flipped over a trailer tossing it on top of four cars monetary losses in the state reached about 100,000 in tennessee thunderstorm winds and tornadoes associated with andrew downed trees and power lines but caused little overall impact to homes and buildings similarly in north carolina thunderstorm winds toppled trees and power lines at a number of locations in the mountainous areas of the state especially in avery county rainfall from andrew spread across the southeastern united states along the appalachian mountains corridor totals of over 5in 125mm were reported where georgia and south carolina meet north carolina in west virginia the remnants of andrew combined with a cold front to produce 1.5 to 2.5in 38 to 64mm of rain over portions of the state causing flooding in areas of morgantown with poor drainage the remnants of andrew also spawned several tornadoes in maryland a tornado in howard county damaged several homes some extensively the twister also tossed and wrecked a recreational vehicle and its trailer downed trees and flattened cornfields precipitation continued along the path of andrews remnants through the mid-atlantic and ohio valley with precipitation measured as far north as upstate new yorkafter the season had ended the world meteorological organizations ra iv hurricane committee retired the name andrew from the list of future names for atlantic tropical cyclones and replaced it with alex the name andrew will never be used again for another atlantic hurricaneinitially the bahamas national disaster coordinator believed that foreign aid was not required but shortly after the storm the government of the united kingdom began distributing blankets food ice and water hmscardiff a royal navy type 42 destroyer was the operational guard ship at the time and assisted in relief operations in and around the gregorytown area in addition assistance came from canada japan and the united states as well as the united nations the american red cross delivered 100tents 100rolls of plastic sheeting and 1,000cots rebuilding began quickly on the hardest hit islands however trees and vegetation were expected to take years to recover despite reconstruction efforts and the small number of resort lodgings affected around 2% officials expected a 10%20% decline in tourism the bahamian government observing that their response mechanisms were not sufficient reformed the national emergency and management agencyafter assessing the devastation in florida and louisiana us president george h w bush initially proposed a 7.1billion aid package to provide disaster benefits small-business loans agricultural recovery food stamps and public housing for victims of hurricane andrew after the house of representatives appropriated aid to victims of hurricane iniki in hawaii and typhoon omar in guam the cost was later increased to 11.1billion the bill which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time was passed by congress as house resolution5620 on september18 and signed into law by president bush on september23 the state of florida alone received 9billion through the disaster relief billthe federal emergency management agency fema was criticized for its slow response in both florida and louisiana even a month prior to andrew the house committee on appropriations  which oversees the budget for fema  released a report calling the agency a political dumping ground and a turkey farm due to its weak inexperienced leaders congressman s william green of new york a member of the appropriations committee stated that he believed the agency learned little from its botched response to hurricane hugo in 1989 however green also criticized local officials for expecting them fema to come and run the whole show some fema officials responded that it was impossible to respond as they had been requested while also continuing to provide aid for the los angeles riots fema spokesman grant peterson stated 24 hours is not reasonable to expect to have all the resources of the federal government landing in the middle of a disasterin florida president bush assessed damage in areas south of miami with florida governor lawton chiles the president quickly declared the region a disaster area which provided public assistance to victims of the storm in broward collier dade and monroe counties lieutenant governor buddy mackay flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking like a war zone governor chiles considered asking the florida state legislature to raise taxes stating that no matter how much congress appropriates to repair damage from hurricane andrew the state will face a substantial cleanup bill instead of raising taxes chiles signed a bill into law on december17 that created a three-year reserve fund for losses to uninsured businesses and homes as well as government and school buildings and functions additionally the bill allowed south floridians to keep an estimated 500million in sales tax generated by rebuilding effortscrime especially looting and theft rose sharply in the areas south of miami immediately after andrew reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern dade county additionally looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm even in homes where few possessions remained initially the slow response of federal aid prompted dade county emergency management director kate hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference where in the hell is the cavalry on this one they keep saying were going to get supplies for gods sake where are they almost immediately president bush promised help is on the way and mobile kitchens food and tents along with over 20,000 units from the florida army national guard 124th infantry regiment from florida the 24th infantry division from fort stewart the 82nd airborne division in fort bragg and the 10th mountain division from fort drum in order to provide temporary housing for the homeless military personnel initially set up a total of five tent cities in florida city and homestead while a sixth tent city was opened at the miccosukee indian reservation shortly after labor day weekend the government of canada dispatched a team 90military engineers to repair community centers hospitals and schools additionally a crew of 300military personnel were sent to miami via the hmcs protecteur to assist american relief teamsthe storm struck florida in the midst of 1992 presidential election campaign a poll conducted by cbs news in september showed that 65% of dade county residents approved of bushs handling of the disaster while 61% of residents approved statewide despite the support of bushs response and his proposal to rebuild homestead air force base he benefited little politically and trailed 48%42% against bill clinton in another poll taken in september additionally 75% of voters in dade county and 82% of floridians overall stated that the presidents actions in response to andrew would not impact their vote in november bush went on to carry the state of florida but by a margin of only 1.89% the hurricane also impacted governor chiles politically the states response to the storm was perceived as poor sinking chiles approval rating to 22% while his disapproval rating rose to 76% however chiles was able to recover prior to the 1994 gubernatorial electionin the aftermath of the storm extensive psychological effects were documented difficulty during clean-up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd the cases of ptsd primarily impacted children a sampling of 378adolescents by the university of south carolinas department of epidemiology and biostatistics indicated that 3% of males and 9% of females met the criteria for ptsd dozens of children in the area attempted suicide while counselors reported that between 50 and 60children discussed killing themselves between december1992 and january1993 a panel of psychiatrists and psychologists at the university of miami agreed that as many as 90% of residents in the worst impacted areas would experience at least a few symptoms of ptsd within six months the circumstances related to the aftermath of andrew led to at least five suicides and four homicidesalthough proposals to rebuild homestead air force base were initially rejected the united states department of defense eventually expended over 100million to begin repairs unsalvageable buildings were demolished reconstruction then began on a florida air national guard tower air traffic control tower and maintenance hangars next the rebuilding of communications medical security facility vehicle maintenance and wing headquarters buildings began on march5 1994 the base reopened as homestead air reserve base prior to andrew the base employed approximately 6,500military personnel and 1,000civilians and annually added about 450million to the local economy after its reopening major bobby dangelo expected the base to annually contribute less than half of that  between 180million and 200million the city of homestead spent about 6million on rebuilding the homestead sports complex despite this the cleveland indians fearing the relocation of their more affluent fans moved their spring training location to chain of lakes park in winter haven as homes were being rebuilt fema provided free temporary mobile homes for 3,501families and financial assistance to more than 40,000other families for staying in hotel rooms paying rent and repairing homes nearly two years after andrew about 70% of homes in homestead that were damaged or destroyed were repaired or rebuilt additionally of the homes destroyed or severely damaged throughout dade county 36,000had been restored by july 1994more than 930,000policyholders in south florida lost coverage after 11insurance companies went bankrupt caused by more than 600,000insurance claims filed this led the florida legislature to create new entities such as the joint underwriting association the florida windstorm underwriting association and the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in an effort to restore adequate insurance capacity stricter building codes were created in florida in the aftermath of hurricane andrew a survey by tim marshall and richard herzog of the haag engineer company in carrollton texas highlighted several construction issues on the roof of some homes the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper which could easily be ripped by straight line winds at houses with shingled roofs it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis also allowing them to be torn away after the tiles or shingles were peeled off the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather eventually the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure leading to roof collapsesin july1996 governor chiles established the florida building codes study commission with the purpose of assessing the building codes at the time as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system the commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed amended and administered by over 400local jurisdictions and state agencies the florida building code was established in 1998 and put into effect by 2002 it phased out local laws and regulations and replaced them with universal statewide building codes after hurricanes charley frances ivan and jeanne in 2004 a study conducted by the university of florida in the following year noted that homes built under the new florida building code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001 a report by the florida legislature in 2006 after hurricanes dennis katrina and wilma in 2005 came to a similar conclusion indicating that they added further evidence that the florida building code is workingthe hurricane also transformed the demographics of dade county a migration of mostly white families northward to broward and palm beach county was ongoing but accelerated after andrew many of these families had used the money they received from insurance claims to relocate the population growth was especially noticeable in southwestern broward county where land development was pushed years ahead of schedule similar migration occurred within the jewish community although there are areas of dade county that still have significant jewish populations many jews resettled to coral springs west fort lauderdale hallandale beach plantation and tamarac in broward county and boca raton and west palm beach in palm beach county the county had a net loss of about 36,000people in 1992 while broward and palm beach counties gained about 17,000 and 2,300dade county residents respectively by 2001 230,710people had moved from dade county to broward county while 29,125dade county residents had moved to palm beach county however as broward county became more crowded 100,871people relocated from broward county to palm beach county consequently the hispanic population in south dade county climbed rapidly in homestead for example the latino population increased from 30% to 45% between 1990 and 2000during the storm a facility housing burmese pythons was destroyed allowing many of them to escape into the everglades although burmese pythons  native to southeast asia  had been sighted in everglades national park since the 1980s the destruction of this facility contributed significantly to the establishment of breeding populations in florida due to rapid reproduction and ability to prey on many species the population of burmese pythons exploded with possibly as many as 300,000 in the everglades alone efforts have been made to curb the thriving population of these invasive snakes including a ban on importation of the species to the united states since january2012 and increased regulations on ownership of a boa constrictor or pythonon august 26 george h w bush toured devastated areas of louisiana with governor edwin edwards president bush remarked the destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years but noted that damage was less severe than in florida after his visit to louisiana president bush declared only terrebonne parish as a disaster area but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration fema initially opened five field offices throughout louisiana these centers allowed residents to submit applications for aid after franklin mayor sam jones and congressman billy tauzin criticized fema for failing to open a field office in franklin fema promised to do so in the first few days following the storm louisiana national guard members and local residents worked to remove debris such as downed trees roofing shingles and torn aluminum siding the state national guard also dispatched water purification units and tanks with filled potable water about 1,300national guardsmen were deployed to southern louisianain early september officials announced that 1,400mobile homes homes and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable house resolution 5620 also included disaster aid to the state of louisiana in early december the small business administration sba approved 33.2million worth of low-interest loans for repairs to homes and businesses by then fema had received about 43,600 applications for aid while approving 35.9million in grants to over 18,000 households that were ineligible for loans from the sba or were uninsured in addition to the mobile homes already provided fema spent 22.6 million on disaster housing
