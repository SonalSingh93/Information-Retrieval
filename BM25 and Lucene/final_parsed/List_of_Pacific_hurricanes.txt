list of pacific hurricanes  wikipedia this is a list of notable pacific hurricanes subdivided by reason for notability notability means that it has met some criterion or achieved some statistic or is part of a top ten for some superlative it includes lists and rankings of pacific hurricanes by different characteristics and impactscharacteristics include extremes of location such as the northernmost or most equator-ward formation or position of a tropical cyclone other characteristics include its central pressure windspeed category on the saffirsimpson scale cyclogenesis outside of a normal hurricane seasons timeframe or storms that remain unnamed despite forming after tropical cyclone naming began in 1960 another characteristic is how long a system went from formation to dissipation these include the cost of damage the number of casualties as well as meteorological statistics such as rainfall point maximaadditionally adolph and israel were removed from the list of names during and after the 2001 season due to political sensitivities knut was removed from the list in 1988 for unknown reasons adele iva and fefa were also removed in 1970 1988 and 1991 respectively for unknown reasons hazel was replaced in 1965 the name isis was also pre-emptively removed from the lists of names for 2016 after being deemed inappropriate because of the eponymous militant group in 2015the following tropical cyclones have caused at least 100 deathsthe following tropical cyclones have caused at least 750million in damagein the central pacific hurricane centers cphc area of responsibility aor the season with the most tropical cyclones is the 2015 season with 16 cyclones forming in or entering the region a season without cyclones has happened a few times since 1966 most recently in 1979before 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable the geostationary satellite era began in 1966 and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records intensity estimates are most reliable starting in the 1971 season a few years later the dvorak technique came into use those two factors make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year for these reasons seasons prior to 1971 are not includednaming of tropical cyclones in the eastern north pacific began in the 1960 season that year four lists of names were created the plan was to proceed in a manner similar to that of the western pacific that is the name of the first storm in one season would be the next unused one from the same list and when the bottom of one list was reached the next list was started this scheme was abandoned in 1965 and next year the lists started being recycled on a four-year rotation starting with the a name each year that same general scheme remains in use today although the names and lists are different on average the eastern north pacific sees about sixteen named storms per yearbefore 1971 and especially 1966 data in this basin is extremely unreliable the geostationary satellite era began in 1966 and that year is often considered the first year of reliable tropical records intensity estimates are more reliable starting in the 1971 season a few years later the dvorak technique came into use those two make intensity estimates more reliable starting in that year for these reasons seasons before 1966 are not included in the lowest column shared by more than five seasons sourcethe pacific hurricane season runs from may 15 to november 30 only systems that develop or enter during the off-season are included the earliest off-season storm is pali in 2016 whilst the latest off-season storm was nine-c during 2015entered the basin on this datetropical cyclones have received official names in the east-central pacific region since 1960 since this time 5 systems that have formed in this area have not received a name plus another possible unnamed subtropical or tropical system in 2006since 1959 only 15 pacific hurricanes are known to have reached category5 and none made landfall while at this intensitysince 1900 113pacific hurricanes have attained category4 intensity of which four made landfall at that strengththis lists all pacific hurricanes that existed as tropical cyclones while in the pacific ocean east of the dateline for more than two weeks continuously hurricanes john and dora spent some time in the west pacific before dissipating john spent eleven days west of the dateline if that time was included john would have existed for a total of 30days and 18hours a world record while including doras time in the west pacific would mean that it existed for 18 days one atlantic hurricane hurricane joan crossed into this basin and was renamed miriam giving it a total lifespan of 22days but not all of that was in the pacific 1993's greg formed from the remnants of 1993's tropical storm bret its time as an atlantic system is excludedall of these systems except trudy olaf and connie existed in both the east and central pacific and all except olaf were hurricanes hurricane trudy of 1990 is thus the longest lived eastern pacific hurricane to stay in the eastern pacific tropical storm olaf of 1997 is hence the longest-lived eastern pacific tropical cyclone not to reach hurricane intensityno known tropical cyclone forming in the central north pacific lasted for longer than 14days without crossing into another basin the tropical cyclone forming in the central pacific that spent the most time there was 2014's hurricane ana at 12.75days from formation to extratropical transitionbefore the weather satellite era began the lifespans of many pacific hurricanes may be underestimatedthis includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossoverit used to be that when a pacific named storm crossed north america and made it to the atlantic or vice versa it would receive the next name on the respective basins list however in 2000 this policy was changed so that a tropical cyclone will keep its name if it remains a tropical cyclone during the entire passage only if it dissipates and then re-forms does it get renamedthis includes only systems which stayed a tropical cyclone during the passage or that maintained a circulation during the crossoverin addition to those there are apparently two additional ones one existed before 1856 and made it to the gulf of mexico another pacific tropical cyclone crossed over central mexico and also made it to the gulf sometime after september 9 1924neither eastern pacific tropical cyclones passing 140w nor central pacific tropical cyclones crossing the dateline are notable events however very few eastern pacific proper cyclones that enter the central pacific make it to the dateline system ceased to be a tropical cyclone before crossing the dateline and subsequently reforming hurricane li formed in the eastern pacific but was not named until it crossed into the central pacificin addition hurricane jimena of 2003 is recognized per nhc cphc and jtwc as a storm that existed in all three areas of responsibility but isnt recognized by the jma as a official western pacific tropical cyclonetropical cyclones crossing from the western pacific to the central pacific are fairly rare and this has happened only seven times before of those seven times five of them were storms which crossed the dateline twice from the western to the central pacific and back or vice versa no tropical cyclone from the western pacific has ever made it past 140w system crossed the dateline twice hurricanetyphoon john formed in the eastern pacificin addition typhoon june of 1958 and tropical storm wene of 2000 are recognized per cphc as basin-crossing storms but arent recognized as such by the jma also tropical storm moke of 1984 may have achieved this feat as well however it isnt recognized as an official western pacific tropical cyclone by either the jma or the jtwctropical cyclones crossing from the eastern pacific to the central pacific are routine ones going the other way are not that event has happened thrice system crossed 140w more than onceit was previously believed that an unnamed hurricane of 1975 crossed 140w and is still included in the nhc as such but according to a reanalysis made by the cphc the storm became extratropical before doing so in addition an unofficial cyclone formed on october 30 2006 in the central pacific subtropics it eventually developed an eye-like structure its track data indicates that it crossed from the central to the east pacific because it formed at longitude 149w and dissipated at 135w nasa which is not a meteorological organization called this system a subtropical cyclone and the naval research laboratory monterey had enough interest in it to call it 91c the system has also been called extratropical this cyclone is unofficial because it is not included in the seasonal reports of either regional specialized meteorological centerthe apparent increase in recent seasons is spurious it is due to better estimation and measurement not an increase in intense storms that is until 1988 pacific hurricanes generally did not have their central pressures measured or estimated from satellite imagery estimated from satellite imagery measured and adjusted measured pressure while east of the international datelineintensity is measured solely by central pressure unless the pressure is not known in which case intensity is measured by maximum sustained winds this tropical cyclone is the strongest to form in its month by virtue of its being the only known systemall of these values are point maxima
