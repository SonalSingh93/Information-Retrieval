nor easter  wikipedia a noreaster also northeaster see below is a macro-scale cyclone the name derives from the direction of the strongest windsas an offshore air mass rotates counterclockwise winds tend to blow northeast-to-southwest over the region covered by the northwest quadrant of the cyclone use of the term in north america is associated with several different types of storms some of which can form in the north atlantic ocean and some of which form as far south as the gulf of mexico the term is most often used in the coastal areas of new england and the mid-atlantic states typically such storms originate as a low-pressure area that forms within 100 miles 160km of the shore between north carolina and massachusetts the precipitation pattern is similar to that of other extratropical storms noreasters are usually accompanied by very heavy rain or snow and can cause severe coastal flooding coastal erosion hurricane-force winds or blizzard conditions noreasters are usually most intense during winter in new england and atlantic canada they thrive on converging air massesthe cold polar air mass and the warmer air over the waterand are more severe in winter when the difference in temperature between these air masses is greaternoreasters tend to develop most often and most powerfully between the months of november and march although they can much less commonly develop during other parts of the year as well the susceptible regions are generally impacted by noreasters a few times each winterthe term noreaster came to american english by way of british english according to the oxford english dictionary the first recorded use in the english language of the term nore north in association with the points of the compass and wind direction was by dekker in 1612 how blowes the winde syr wynde is nore-nore-west however this is incorrect as john lyly uses the term the same way in his play of 1585 gallatheasimilar uses occurred in 1688 nore and nore-west and in 1718 nore-west or nore-nore-west these recorded uses are predated by use of the term noreast first recorded as used by davis in 1594 noreast by north raiseth a degree in sayling 24 leagues and shown for instance on a compass card published in 1607 thus the manner of pronouncing from memory the 32 points of the compass known in maritime training as boxing the compass is described by ansted with pronunciations noreast or west nor nor-east or west noreast b east or west and so forth according to the oed the first recorded use of the term noreaster occurs in 1836 in a translation of aristophanes the term noreaster naturally developed from the historical spellings and pronunciations of the compass points and the direction of wind or sailingas noted in a january 2006 editorial by william sisson editor of soundings magazine use of noreaster to describe the storm system is common along the us east coast yet it has been asserted by linguist mark liberman see below that noreaster as a contraction for northeaster has no basis in regional new england dialect the boston accent would elide the r notheastuh he describes noreaster as a fake word however this view neglects the little-known etymology and the historical maritime usage described abovenineteenth-century downeast mariners pronounced the compass point north northeast as nonuth-east and so on for decades edgar comee of brunswick maine waged a determined battle against use of the term noreaster by the press which usage he considered a pretentious and altogether lamentable affectation and the odious even loathsome practice of landlubbers who would be seen as salty as the sea itself his efforts which included mailing hundreds of postcards were profiled just before his death at the age of 88 in the new yorkerdespite the efforts of comee and others use of the term continues by the press according to boston globe writer jan freeman from 1975 to 1980 journalists used the noreaster spelling only once in five mentions of such storms in the past year 2003 more than 80 percent of northeasters were spelled noreasteruniversity of pennsylvania linguistics professor mark liberman has pointed out that while the oxford english dictionary cites examples dating back to 1837 these examples represent the contributions of a handful of non-new england poets and writers liberman posits that noreaster may have originally been a literary affectation akin to een for even and thonly for the only which is an indication in spelling that two syllables count for only one position in metered verse with no implications for actual pronunciationhowever despite these assertions the term can be found in the writings of new englanders and was frequently used by the press in the 19th centuryusage existed into the 20th century in the form ofnoreasters develop in response to the sharp contrast in the warm gulf stream ocean current coming up from the tropical atlantic and the cold air masses coming down from canada when the very cold and dry air rushes southward and meets up with the warm gulf stream current which is often near 70f 21c even in mid-winter intense low pressure developsin the upper atmosphere the strong winds of the jet stream remove and replace rising air from the atlantic more rapidly than the atlantic air is replaced at lower levels this and the coriolis force help develop a strong storm the storm tracks northeast along the east coast past the carolinas the mid-atlantic and the new england coastal states counterclockwise winds around the low-pressure system blow the moist air over land the relatively warm moist air meets cold air coming southward from canada the low increases the surrounding pressure difference which causes the very different air masses to collide at a faster speed when the difference in temperature of the air masses is larger so is the storms instability turbulence and thus severitythe noreasters taking the east coast track usually indicates the presence of a high-pressure area in the vicinity of nova scotia sometimes a noreaster will move slightly inland and bring rain to the cities on the coastal plain new york city philadelphia baltimore etc and snow in new england boston northward it can move slightly offshore bringing a wet snow south of boston to richmond virginia or even parts of the carolinas such a storm will rapidly intensify tracking northward and following the topography of the east coast sometimes continuing to grow stronger during its entire existence a noreaster usually reaches its peak intensity while off the canadian coast the storm then reaches arctic areas and can reach intensities equal to that of a weak hurricane it then meanders throughout the north atlantic and can last for several weeksnoreasters are usually formed by an area of vorticity associated with an upper-level disturbance or from a kink in a frontal surface that causes a surface low-pressure area to develop such storms are very often formed from the merging of several weaker storms a parent storm and a polar jet stream mixing with the tropical jet streamuntil the noreaster passes thick dark low-level clouds often block out the sun temperatures usually fall significantly due to the presence of the cooler air from winds that typically come from a northeasterly direction during a single storm the precipitation can range from a torrential downpour to a fine mist all precipitation types can occur in a noreaster high wind gusts which can reach hurricane strength are also associated with a noreaster on very rare occasions such as in the north american blizzard of 2006 and a noreaster in 1978 the center of the storm can take on the circular shape more typical of a hurricane and have a small dry slot near the center which can be mistaken for an eye although it is not an eyeoften people mistake noreasters for tropical cyclones and do not differentiate between the two weather systems noreasters differ from tropical cyclones in that noreasters are cold-core low-pressure systems meaning that they thrive on cold air tropical cyclones are warm-core low-pressure systems which means they thrive on warm temperaturesa noreaster is formed in a strong extratropical cyclone usually experiencing bombogenesis while this formation occurs in many places around the world noreasters are unique for their combination of northeast winds and moisture content of the swirling clouds nearly similar conditions sometimes occur during winter in the pacific northeast northern japan and northwards with winds from nw-n in europe similar weather systems with such severity are hardly possible the moisture content of the clouds is usually not high enough to cause flooding or heavy snow though ne winds can be strongthe eastern united states from north carolina to maine and eastern canada can experience noreasters though most often they affect the areas from northern new jersey northward the effects of a noreaster sometimes bring high tides and strong winds as far south as coastal south carolina and georgia surfers wait in anticipation when a noreaster is formed noreasters cause a significant amount of beach erosion in these areas as well as flooding in the associated low-lying areasbiologists at the woods hole oceanographic institution on cape cod have determined noreasters are an environmental factor for red tides on the atlantic coasthere is a list of notable noreasters followed by a short description about the event
