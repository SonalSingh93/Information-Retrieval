1933 atlantic hurricane season  wikipedia the 1933 atlantic hurricane season was the second most active atlantic hurricane season on record with 20storms forming in the northwest atlantic ocean breaking the record set by 1887 the season ran through the summer and the first half of fall in 1933 with activity as early as may and as late as november a tropical cyclone was active for all but 13days from june 28 to october 7 the year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season which broke the record with 28storms tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration may have remained undetected because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s historical data on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24tropical cyclonesof the 20storms during the season 11 attained hurricane status six of those were major hurricanes with sustained winds of over 111mph 179kmh two of the hurricanes reached winds of 160mph 260kmh which is a category 5the highest of 5 on the modern saffir-simpson hurricane scale the season produced several deadly storms with eight storms killing more than 20people all but 3 of the 20known storms affected land at some point during their durationsthe 1933 season was the most active of its time surpassing the previous record-holder of 19storms in 1887 fifteen of the seasons storms made landfall as tropical cyclones and another struck land as an extratropical storm eight tropical storms including six hurricanes hit the united states during the season including the chesapeakepotomac hurricane which the us weather bureau described as one of the most severe in history along the mid-atlantic states seven tropical storms including four hurricanes hit mexico two of which caused severe damage in the tampico areathe season was continuously active with six storms forming during the month of august alone at the time many storms received the distinction of being the earliest nth storm to form such as the earliest fifth tropical storm to form in a season most of the records were broken in later years during the season the us weather bureau issued storm and hurricane warnings for eight storms including coastal portions of texas as well as from florida to massachusetts forcing the evacuations of thousands of people the deadliest storm of the season was a hurricane that struck tampico mexico killing over 184residents the costliest hurricane was the chesapeakepotomac hurricane which caused 27million in damage from north carolina to new jersey the hurricane produced rainfall that resulted in severe crop damage in marylandin addition to the 20tropical storms there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity the first developed on june1 in the northwest caribbean and dissipated a few days later another depression developed on july11 over panama and also quickly dissipated a tropical depression developed on july17 in the northeastern atlantic west of the azores and one ship reported hurricane-force winds however there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized so it was not classified as a tropical storm originally there was a tropical storm in the database in the caribbean in the middle of august but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds similarly there was a tropical storm in the database in late september but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force windsthe season produced the highest accumulated cyclone energy ace on record with a total of 259 the measurement is a method to compare tropical cyclone activity between seasons originally 1933 had an ace of 213 which was surpassed by 1950 and 2005 however the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project found that the storms in 1933 were stronger than initially reportedthe first storm of the season formed on may14 in the southwestern caribbean sea off the east coast of nicaragua it moved quickly to the north-northwest passing just northeast of the eastern tip of honduras on may15 the storm turned to the west and entered the gulf of mexico while moving around the yucatn peninsula the next day it attained peak winds of 50mph 85kmh based on a ship report turning southward the storm made landfall on ciudad del carmen in mexico early on may19 with winds of 40mph 64kmh it dissipated over land later that daya westward-moving tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on june24 about halfway between the southern lesser antilles and the coast of africa the depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm and by june27 it became a hurricane off the northern coast of guyana at 2100utc that day the hurricane struck extreme southern trinidad with winds of 85mph 137kmh after crossing the island the hurricane moved across the paria peninsula in northeastern venezuela with the same intensity the hurricane was earliest to affect the region on record and

extratropical origin developed into a small tropical storm on september24 southwest of the azores initially the storm moved north-northwestward and based on ship reports it is estimated the system intensified into a hurricane on september26 it passed west of the azores as it turned to the north-northeast weakening to a tropical storm later that day on september27 the storm became extratropical and the next day it dissipateda tropical disturbance moved through the lesser antilles in late september after crossing hispaniola a tropical depression developed on october1 north of the dominican
