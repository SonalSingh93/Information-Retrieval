the president also directs the foreign and domestic policy of the united states in addition article one of the united states constitution assigns to the president the power to sign legislation into

have served 45 presidencies counting grover clevelands two non-consecutive terms separately spanning 57 full four-year terms incumbent donald trump was elected on tuesday november 8 2016 the next presidential election will be held on tuesday november 3 2020in 1776 the thirteen colonies acting through the second continental congress declared political independence from great britain during the american revolution the new states though independent of each other as nation states recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the british desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy congress negotiated the articles of confederation to establish an alliance between the states as a central authority congress under the articles was without any legislative power it could make its own resolutions determinations and regulations but not any laws nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens this institutional design reflected how americans believed the deposed british system of crown and parliament ought to have functioned with respect to the royal dominion a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire out from under any monarchy the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives eg making war receiving ambassadors etc to congress while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the articles take effect on march 1 1781 when maryland became the final state to ratify themin 1783 the treaty of paris secured independence for each of the former colonies with peace at hand the states each turned toward their own internal affairs by 1786 americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another they witnessed their hard currency pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports their mediterranean commerce preyed upon by north african pirates and their foreign-financed revolutionary war debts unpaid and accruing interest civil and political unrest loomedfollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between virginia and maryland at the mount vernon conference in 1785 virginia called for a trade conference between all the states set for september 1786 in annapolis maryland with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms when the convention failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states alexander hamilton led the annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the articles to be held the next spring in philadelphia prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until james madison and edmund randolph succeeded in securing george washingtons attendance to philadelphia as a delegate for virginiawhen the constitutional convention convened in may 1787 the 12 state delegations in attendance rhode island did not send delegates brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers elected annually by the legislature to a single term only sharing power with an executive council and countered by a strong legislature new york offered the greatest exception having a strong unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter it was through the closed-door negotiations at philadelphia that the presidency framed in the us constitution emergedthe first power the constitution confers upon the president is the veto the presentment clause requires that any bill passed by congress to be presented to the president before it can become law once the legislation has been presented the president has three optionsin 1996 congress attempted to enhance the presidents veto power with the line item veto act the legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill particularly any new spending any amount of discretionary spending or any new limited tax benefit congress could then repass that particular item if the president then vetoed the new legislation congress could override the veto by its ordinary means a two-thirds vote in both houses in clinton v city of new york 524 us 417 1998 the us supreme court ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutionalperhaps the most important of all presidential powers is the command of the united states armed forces as its commander-in-chief while the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in congress the president has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the military the present-day operational command of the armed forces belonging to the department of defense is normally exercised through the secretary of defense with assistance of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to the combatant commands as outlined in the presidentially approved unified command plan ucp the framers of the constitution took care to limit the presidents powers regarding the military alexander hamilton explains this in federalist no 69the president is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the united states  it would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces  while that the power of the british king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies all of which  would appertain to the legislature emphasis in the originalcongress pursuant to the war powers resolution must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed rendering it ineffectual additionally congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation while historically presidents initiated the process for going to war critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations including theodore roosevelts military move into panama in 1903 the korean war the vietnam war and the invasions of grenada in 1983 and panama in 1990along with the armed forces the president also directs us foreign policy through the department of state and the department of defense the president is responsible for the protection of americans abroad and of foreign nationals in the united states the president decides whether to recognize new nations and new governments and negotiates treaties with other nations which become binding on the united states when approved by two-thirds vote of the senatethe president is the head of the executive branch of the federal government and is constitutionally obligated to take care that the laws be faithfully executed the executive branch has over four million employees including members of the militarypresidents make numerous executive branch appointments an incoming president may make up to 6,000 before taking office and 8,000 more while serving ambassadors members of the cabinet and other federal officers are all appointed by a president with the advice and consent of a majority of the senate when the senate is in recess for at least ten days the president may make recess appointments recess appointments are temporary and expire at the end of the next session of the senatethe power of a president to fire executive officials has long been a contentious political issue generally a president may remove purely executive officials at will however congress can curtail and constrain a presidents authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statutethe president additionally possesses the ability to direct much of the executive branch through executive orders that are grounded in federal law or constitutionally granted executive power executive orders are reviewable by federal courts and can be superseded by federal legislation and supreme courts decisionsto manage the growing federal bureaucracy presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff who were eventually organized into the executive office of the president of the united states within the executive office the presidents innermost layer of aides and their assistants are located in the white house officepresident also has unreviewable authority over the matters of immigration and can ban entry to the usa of foreign nationals who have no credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the united states at willthe president also has the power to nominate federal judges including members of the united states courts of appeals and the supreme court of the united states however these nominations require senate confirmation securing senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance when nominating judges to us district courts presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of senatorial courtesy presidents may also grant pardons and reprieves bill clinton pardoned patty hearst on his last day in office as is often done just before the end of a presidential term but not without controversyhistorically two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy the first is executive privilege which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties george washington first claimed privilege when congress requested to see chief justice john jays notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with great britain while not enshrined in the constitution or any other law washingtons action created the precedent for the privilege when richard nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to congress during the watergate scandal the supreme court ruled in united states v nixon 418 us 683 1974 that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution when president bill clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the lewinsky scandal the supreme court ruled in clinton v jones 520 us 681 1997 that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits these cases established the legal precedent that executive privilege is valid although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined additionally federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the presidentthe state secrets privilege allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from discovery in legal proceedings if such release would harm national security precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when thomas jefferson refused to release military documents in the treason trial of aaron burr and again in totten v united states 92 us 105 1876 when the supreme court dismissed a case brought by a former union spy however the privilege was not formally recognized by the us supreme court until united states v reynolds 345 us 1 1953 where it was held to be a common law evidentiary privilege before the september 11 attacks use of the privilege had been rare but increasing in frequency since 2001 the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims as in the ninth circuits ruling in mohamed v jeppesen dataplan inc critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actionsthe constitutions ineligibility clause prevents the president and all other executive officers from simultaneously being a member of congress therefore the president cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in congress however the president can take an indirect role in shaping legislation especially if the presidents political party has a majority in one or both houses of congress for example the president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into congress the president can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated periodic reports to congress these reports may be either written or oral but today are given as the state of the union address which often outlines the presidents legislative proposals for the coming year additionally the president may attempt to have congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are madein the 20th century critics began charging that too many legislative and budgetary powers have slid into the hands of presidents that should belong to congress as the head of the executive branch presidents control a vast array of agencies that can issue regulations with little oversight from congress one critic charged that presidents could appoint a virtual army of czars  each wholly unaccountable to congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the white house presidents have been criticized for making signing statements when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it this practice has been criticized by the american bar association as unconstitutional conservative commentator george will wrote of an increasingly swollen executive branch and the eclipse of congressaccording to article ii section 3 clause 2 of the constitution the president may convene either or both houses of congress if both houses cannot agree on a date of adjournment the president may appoint a date for congress to adjournas head of state the president can fulfill traditions established by previous presidents william howard taft started the tradition of throwing out the ceremonial first pitch in 1910 at griffith stadium washington dc on the washington senators opening day every president since taft except for jimmy carter threw out at least one ceremonial first ball or pitch for opening day the all-star game or the world series usually with much fanfarethe president of the united states has served as the honorary president of the boy scouts of america since the founding of the organizationother presidential traditions are associated with american holidays rutherford b hayes began in 1878 the first white house egg rolling for local children beginning in 1947 during the harry s truman administration every thanksgiving the president is presented with a live domestic turkey during the annual national thanksgiving turkey presentation held at the white house since 1989 when the custom of pardoning the turkey was formalized by george h w bush the turkey has been taken to a farm where it will live out the rest of its natural lifepresidential traditions also involve the presidents role as head of government many outgoing presidents since james buchanan traditionally give advice to their successor during the presidential transition ronald reagan and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the oval office on inauguration day for the incoming presidentduring a state visit by a foreign head of state the president typically hosts a state arrival ceremony held on the south lawn a custom begun by john f kennedy in 1961 this is followed by a state dinner given by the president which is held in the state dining room later in the eveningthe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nations premier celebrities some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration public relations officials as well as by presidents themselves one critic described the presidency as propagandized leadership which has a mesmerizing power surrounding the office administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted photo-ops of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras one critic wrote the image of john f kennedy was described as carefully framed in rich detail which drew on the power of myth regarding the incident of pt 109 and wrote that kennedy understood how to use images to further his presidential ambitions as a result some political commentators have opined that american voters have unrealistic expectations of presidents voters expect a president to drive the economy vanquish enemies lead the free world comfort tornado victims heal the national soul and protect borrowers from hidden credit-card feesmost of the nations founding fathers expected the congress which was the first branch of government described in the constitution to be the dominant branch of government they did not expect a strong executive however presidential power has shifted over time which has resulted in claims that the modern presidency has become too powerful unchecked unbalanced and monarchist in nature critic dana d nelson believes presidents over the past thirty years have worked towards undivided presidential control of the executive branch and its agencies she criticizes proponents of the unitary executive for expanding the many existing uncheckable executive powers  such as executive orders decrees memorandums proclamations national security directives and legislative signing statements  that already allow presidents to enact a good deal of foreign and domestic policy without aid interference or consent from congress activist bill wilson opined that the expanded presidency was the greatest threat ever to individual freedom and democratic rulearticle ii section 1 clause 5 of the constitution sets the following qualifications for holding the presidencya person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of president under any of the following conditionsthe modern presidential campaign begins before the primary elections which the two major political parties use to clear the field of candidates before their national nominating conventions where the most successful candidate is made the partys nominee for president typically the partys presidential candidate chooses a vice presidential nominee and this choice is rubber-stamped by the convention the most common previous profession of us presidents is lawyernominees participate in nationally televised debates and while the debates are usually restricted to the democratic and republican nominees third party candidates may be invited such as ross perot in the 1992 debates nominees campaign across the country to explain their views convince voters and solicit contributions much of the modern electoral process is concerned with winning swing states through frequent visits and mass media advertising drivesthe president is elected indirectly a number of electors collectively known as the electoral college officially select the president on election day voters in each of the states and the district of columbia cast ballots for these electors each state is allocated a number of electors equal to the size of its delegation in both houses of congress combined generally the ticket that wins the most votes in a state wins all of that states electoral votes and thus has its slate of electors chosen to vote in the electoral collegethe winning slate of electors meet at its states capital on the first monday after the second wednesday in december about six weeks after the election to vote they then send a record of that vote to congress the vote of the electors is opened by the sitting vice presidentacting in that roles capacity as

chief justice of the united statesthe term of office for president and vice president is four years george washington the first president set an unofficial precedent of serving only two terms before franklin d roosevelt ulysses s grant and theodore roosevelt each unsuccessfully sought a third term in 1940 franklin d roosevelt was elected to a third term after being drafted by his party in 1941 the united states entered world war ii leading voters to elect roosevelt to a fourth term in 1944 roosevelt died on april 12 1945 82 days into his fourth termafter the war and in response to roosevelt being elected to third and fourth terms the twenty-second amendment was adopted the amendment bars anyone from being elected president more than twice or once if that person served more than half of another presidents term harry s truman president when this amendment was adopted was exempted from its limitations and briefly sought a third a second full term before withdrawing from the 1952

the vice president who then becomes acting president by transmitting a statement to the speaker of the house and the president pro tempore of the senate stating the reasons for the transfer the president resumes the discharge of the presidential powers and duties upon transmitting to those two officials a written declaration stating that resumption this transfer of power may occur for any reason the president considers appropriate in 2002 and again in 2007 president george w bush briefly transferred presidential authority to vice president dick cheney in both cases this was done to accommodate a medical procedure that required bush to be sedated both times bush returned to duty later the same dayunder section 4 of the twenty-fifth amendment the vice president in conjunction with a majority of the cabinet may transfer the presidential powers and duties from the president to the vice president by transmitting a written declaration to the speaker of the house and the president

president however the president can declare that no such inability exists and resume the discharge of the presidential powers and duties if the vice president and cabinet contest this claim it is up to congress which must meet within two days if not already in session to decide the merit of the claimthe united states constitution mentions the resignation of the president but does not regulate its form or the conditions for its validity pursuant to federal law the only valid evidence of the presidents resignation is a written instrument to that effect signed by the president and delivered to

president pro tempore of the senate followed by every member of the cabinet a person must fulfill all eligibility requirements of the office of president to be eligible to become acting president ineligible individuals are skippedthroughout most of its history politics of the united states have been dominated by political parties political parties had not been anticipated when the us constitution was drafted in 1787 nor did they exist at the time of the first presidential election in 17881789 organized political parties developed in the us in the mid1790s but political factions from which organized parties evolved began to appear almost immediately after the federal government came into existence those who supported the washington administration were referred to as pro-administration and would eventually form the federalist party while those in opposition joined the emerging democratic-republican partygreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency he was and remains the only us president never to be affiliated with a political party since george washington 43 persons have been sworn into office as president and all have been affiliated with a political party at the time
