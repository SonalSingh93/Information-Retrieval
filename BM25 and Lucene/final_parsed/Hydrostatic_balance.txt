hydrostatic equilibrium  wikipedia in fluid mechanics a fluid is said to be in hydrostatic equilibrium or hydrostatic balance when it is at rest or when the flow velocity at each point is constant over time this occurs when external forces such as gravity are balanced by a pressure gradient force for instance the pressure-gradient force prevents gravity from collapsing earths atmosphere into a thin dense shell whereas gravity prevents the pressure gradient force from diffusing the atmosphere into spacehydrostatic equilibrium is the current distinguishing criterion between dwarf planets and small solar system bodies and has other roles in astrophysics and planetary geology this qualification typically means that the object is symmetrically rounded into a spheroid or ellipsoid shape where any irregular surface features are due to a relatively thin solid crust there are 31 observationally confirmed such objects apart from the sun sometimes called planemos in the solar system seven more that are virtually certain and a hundred or so more that are likelynewtons laws of motion state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it this means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction this force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibriumthe fluid can be split into a large number of cuboid volume elements by considering a single element the action of the fluid can be derivedthere are 3 forces the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure p of the fluid above it is from the definition of pressuresimilarly the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards isfinally the weight of the volume element causes a force downwards if the density is  the volume is v and g the standard gravity thenthe volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom times the height the formula for finding the volume of a cubeby balancing these forces the total force on the fluid isthis sum equals zero if the fluids velocity is constant dividing by aorptop  pbottom is a change in pressure and h is the height of the volume elementa change in the distance above the ground by saying these changes are infinitesimally small the equation can be written in differential formdensity changes with pressure and gravity changes with height so the equation would benote finally that this last equation can be derived by solving the three-dimensional navierstokes equations for the equilibrium situation wherethen the only non-trivial equation is the -equation which now readsthus hydrostatic balance can be regarded as a particularly simple equilibrium solution of the navierstokes equationsby plugging the energy momentum tensor for a perfect fluidinto the einstein field equationsand using the conservation conditionone can derive the tolmanoppenheimervolkoff equation for the structure of a static spherically symmetric relativistic star in isotropic coordinatesin practice  and  are related by an equation of state of the form f0 with f specific to makeup of the star mr is a foliation of spheres weighted by the mass density r with the largest sphere having radius rper standard procedure in taking the nonrelativistic limit we let c so that the factortherefore in the nonrelativistic limit the tolmanoppenheimervolkoff equation reduces to newtons hydrostatic equilibriumwe have made the trivial notation change hr and have used f0 to express  in terms of p a similar equation can be computed for rotating axially symmetric stars which in its gauge independent form readsunlike the tov equilibrium equation these are two equations for instance if as usual when treating stars one chooses spherical coordinates as basis coordinates  the index i runs for the coordinates r and the hydrostatic equilibrium pertains to hydrostatics and the principles of equilibrium of fluids a hydrostatic balance is a particular balance for weighing substances in water hydrostatic balance allows the discovery of their specific gravitiesin any given layer of a star there is a hydrostatic equilibrium between the outward thermal pressure from below and the weight of the material above pressing inward the isotropic gravitational field compresses the star into the most compact shape possible a rotating star in hydrostatic equilibrium is an oblate spheroid up to a certain critical angular velocity an extreme example of this phenomenon is the star vega which has a rotation period of 12.5 hours consequently vega is about 20% larger at the equator than at the poles a star with an angular velocity above the critical angular velocity becomes a jacobi scalene ellipsoid and at still faster rotation it is no longer ellipsoidal but piriform or oviform with yet other shapes beyond that though shapes beyond scalene are not stableif the star has a massive nearby companion object then tidal forces come into play as well distorting the star into a scalene shape when rotation alone would make it a spheroid an example of this is beta lyraehydrostatic equilibrium is also important for the intracluster medium where it restricts the amount of fluid that can be present in the core of a cluster of galaxieswe can also use the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium to estimate the velocity dispersion of dark matter in clusters of galaxies only baryonic matter or rather the collisions thereof emits x-ray radiation the absolute x-ray luminosity per unit volume takes the form  where  and  are the temperature and density of the baryonic matter and  is some function of temperature and fundamental constants the baryonic density satisfies the above equation the integral is a measure of the total mass of the cluster with  being the proper distance to the center of the cluster using the ideal gas law  is boltzmanns constant and  is a characteristic mass of the baryonic gas particles and rearranging we arrive atmultiplying by  and differentiating with respect to  yieldsif we make the assumption that cold dark matter particles have an isotropic velocity distribution then the same derivation applies to these particles and their density  satisfies the non-linear differential equationwith perfect x-ray and distance data we could calculate the baryon density at each point in the cluster and thus the dark matter density we could then calculate the velocity dispersion  of the dark matter which is given bythe central density ratio  is dependent on the redshift  of the cluster and is given bywhere  is the angular width of the cluster and  the proper distance to the cluster values for the ratio range from 11 to 14 for various surveysthe concept of hydrostatic equilibrium has also become important in determining whether an astronomical object is a planet dwarf planet or small solar system body according to the definition of planet adopted by the international astronomical union in 2006 one defining characteristic of planets and dwarf planets is that they are objects that have sufficient gravity to overcome their own rigidity and assume hydrostatic equilibrium such a body will normally have the differentiated interior and geology of a world a planemo though near-hydrostatic bodies such as the proto-planet 4 vesta may also be differentiated sometimes the equilibrium shape is an oblate spheroid as is the case with earth however in the cases of moons in synchronous orbit nearly unidirectional tidal forces create a scalene ellipsoid also the dwarf planet haumea is scalene due to its rapid rotationit had been thought that icy objects with a diameter larger than roughly 400km are usually in hydrostatic equilibrium whereas those smaller than that are not icy objects need less mass for hydrostatic equilibrium than rocky objects the smallest object that is known to have an equilibrium shape is the icy moon mimas at 397km whereas the largest object known to have an obviously non-equilibrium shape is the rocky asteroid pallas at 532km 58255650018km however mimas is not actually in hydrostatic equilibrium for its current rotation the smallest body confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon rhea at 1,528km whereas the largest body known to not be in hydrostatic equilibrium is the icy moon iapetus at 1,470kmbecause the terrestrial planets and dwarf planets and likewise the larger satellites like the moon and io have irregular surfaces this definition evidently has some flexibility but a specific means of quantifying an objects shape by this standard has not yet been announced local irregularities may be consistent with global equilibrium for example the massive base of the tallest mountain on earth mauna kea has deformed and depressed the level of the surrounding crust so that the overall distribution of mass approaches equilibrium the amount of leeway afforded the definition could affect the classification of the asteroid vesta which may have solidified while in hydrostatic equilibrium but was subsequently significantly deformed by large impacts now 572.6557.2446.4kmin the atmosphere the pressure of the air decreases with increasing altitude this pressure difference causes an upward force called the pressure-gradient force the force of gravity balances this out keeping the atmosphere bound to earth and maintaining pressure differences with altitude
