hurricanes category 3 or above occur infrequently more often maryland gets the remnants of a tropical system which has already come ashore and released most of its energy maryland averages around 3040 days of thunderstorms a year and averages around six tornado strikes annuallythe catholic george calvert 1st lord baltimore 15791632 sought a charter from king charles i for the territory between massachusetts to the north and virginia to the immediate south after george calvert died in april 1632 the charter was granted to his son cecilius calvert 2nd baron baltimore 16051675 on june 20 1632 officially the new maryland colony was named in honor of henrietta maria of france wife of charles i of england alternatively some catholic scholars and historians believe maryland may have been named after mary the mother of jesus by george calvert 1st lord baltimore prior to his death in 1632 his original intent may never fully be known the specific name given in the charter was phrased terra mariae anglice maryland the english name was preferred due to undesired associations of mariae with the spanish jesuit juan de mariana linked to the inquisition in addition henrietta was never referred to by both her first and middle name scholars also agree that under no circumstances was a territory ever named after someones middle name many agree that since the original capital of maryland was st marys city on the north shore of the potomac river and the county surrounding it the first erectedcreated in the province was named st marys county maryland was most likely named after mary the mother of jesus christ the great seal of maryland also supports this conclusion the obverse side of the seal reads terr mari which translates in latin as land of mary instead of terr maria which would acknowledge henriettas middle namelord baltimores first settlers arrived in the new colony in march 1634 with his younger brother leonard calvert 16061647 as first provincial governor of maryland they made their first permanent settlement at st marys city in what is now st marys county they purchased the site from the paramount chief of the region who was eager to establish trade st marys became the first capital of maryland and remained so for 60 years until 1695 more settlers soon followed their tobacco crops were successful and quickly made the new colony profitable however given the incidence of malaria yellow fever and typhoid life expectancy in maryland was about 10 years less than in new englandmaryland was founded for the purpose of providing religious toleration of englands roman catholic minority in 1642 a number of puritans left virginia for maryland and founded providence now called annapolis on the western shore of the upper chesapeake bay a dispute with traders from virginia over kent island in the chesapeake led to armed conflict in 1644 william claiborne a puritan seized kent island while his associate the pro-parliament puritan richard ingle took over st marys both used religion as a tool to gain popular support the two years from 16441646 that claiborne and his puritan associates held sway were known as the plundering time they captured jesuit priests imprisoned them then sent them back to englandin 1646 leonard calvert returned with troops recaptured st marys city and restored order the house of delegates passed the act concerning religion in 1649 granting religious liberty to all trinitarian christiansin 1650 the puritans revolted against the proprietary government protestants swept the catholics out of the legislature and religious strife returned the puritans set up a new government prohibiting both roman catholicism and anglicanism the puritan revolutionary government persecuted maryland catholics during its reign known as the plundering time mobs burned down all the original catholic churches of southern maryland the puritan rule lasted until 1658 when the calvert family and lord baltimore regained proprietary control and re-enacted the toleration actafter englands glorious revolution of 1688 maryland outlawed catholicism this lasted until after the american revolutionary war 17751783 wealthy catholic planters built chapels on their land to practice their religion in relative secrecythe royal charter granted maryland the land north of the potomac river up to the 40th parallel a problem arose when charles ii granted a charter for pennsylvania the grant defined pennsylvanias southern border as identical to marylands northern border the 40th parallel but the grant indicated that charles ii and william penn assumed the 40th parallel would pass close to new castle delaware when it falls north of philadelphia the site of which penn had already selected for his colonys capital city negotiations ensued after the problem was discovered in 1681a compromise proposed by charles ii in 1682 was undermined by penns receiving the additional grant of what is now delaware penn successfully argued that the maryland charter entitled lord baltimore only to unsettled lands and dutch settlement in delaware predated his charter the dispute remained unresolved for nearly a century carried on by the descendants of william penn and lord baltimore the calvert family which controlled maryland and the penn family which controlled pennsylvaniathe border dispute with pennsylvania led to cresaps war in the 1730s hostilities erupted in 1730 and escalated through the first half of the decade culminating in the deployment of military forces by maryland in 1736 and by pennsylvania in 1737 the armed phase of the conflict ended in may 1738 with the intervention of king george ii who compelled the negotiation of a cease-fire a provisional agreement had been established in 1732negotiations continued until a final agreement was signed in 1760 the agreement defined the border between maryland and pennsylvania as the line of latitude now known as the masondixon line marylands border with delaware was based on a transpeninsular line and the twelve-mile circle around new castlemost of the english colonists arrived in maryland as indentured servants and had to serve a several years term as laborers to pay for their passage in the early years the line between indentured servants and african slaves or laborers was fluid and white and black laborers commonly lived and worked together and formed unions mixed-race children born to white mothers were considered free by the principle of partus sequitur ventrem by which children took the social status of their mothers a principle of slave law that was adopted throughout the colonies following virginia in 1662 during the colonial era families of free people of color were formed most often by unions of white women and african menmany of the free black families migrated to delaware where land was cheaper as the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in england planters in maryland imported thousands more slaves and racial caste lines hardened the economys growth and prosperity was based on slave labor devoted first to the production of tobacco as the commodity cropmaryland was one of the thirteen colonies that revolted against british rule in the american revolution on february 2 1781 maryland became the 13th state to approve the ratification of the articles of confederation which brought into being the united states as a united sovereign and national state it also became the seventh state admitted to the us after ratifying the new constitution in december 1790 maryland donated land selected by president george washington to the federal government for the creation of the new national capital of washington dc the land was provided from montgomery and prince georges counties as well as from fairfax county and alexandria in virginia however the land donated by virginia was later returned to that state by the district of columbia retrocessioninfluenced by a changing economy revolutionary ideals and preaching by ministers numerous planters in maryland freed their slaves in the 20 years after the revolutionary war across the upper south the free black population increased from less than 1% before the war to 14% by 1810during the war of 1812 the british military attempted to capture baltimore which was protected by fort mchenry during this bombardment the song star spangled banner was written by francis scott key it was later adopted as the national anthemthe national road us hwy 40 today was authorized in 1817 and ran from baltimore to st louis  the first federal highway the baltimore and ohio railroad bo was the first chartered railroad in the united states it opened its first section of track for regular operation in 1830 between baltimore and ellicott city and in 1852 it became the first rail line to reach the ohio river from the eastern seaboardthe state remained with the union during the civil war due in significant part to demographics and federal intervention by 1860 49% of marylands african americans were free blacksgovernor thomas holliday hicks suspended the state legislature and to help ensure the election of a new pro-union governor and legislature president abraham lincoln had a number of its pro-slavery politicians arrested including the mayor of baltimore george william brown suspended several civil liberties including habeas corpus and ordered artillery placed on federal hill overlooking baltimore historians debate the constitutionality of these wartime actions and the suspension of civil liberties was later deemed illegal by the us supreme courtin april 1861 federal units and state regiments were attacked as they marched through baltimore sparking the baltimore riot of 1861 the first bloodshed in the civil war of the 115,000 men from maryland who joined the military during the civil war 85,000 or 77% joined the union army while the remainder joined the confederate army the largest and most significant battle in the state was the battle of antietam on september 17 1862 near sharpsburg although a tactical draw the battle was considered a strategic union victory and a turning point of the wara new state constitution in 1864 abolished slavery and following passage of constitutional amendments that granted voting rights to freedmen in 1867 the state extended suffrage to non-white malesthe democratic party rapidly regained power in the state from republicans democrats replaced the constitution of 1864 with the constitution of 1867 following the end of reconstruction in 1877 democrats devised means of disfranchising blacks initially by physical intimidation and voter fraud later by constitutional amendments and laws blacks and immigrants however resisted democratic party disfranchisement efforts in the state maryland blacks were part of a biracial republican coalition elected to state government in 18961904 and comprised 20% of the electoratecompared to some other states blacks were better established both before and after the civil war nearly half the population was free before the war and some had accumulated property half the population lived in cities literacy was high among blacks and as democrats crafted means to exclude them suffrage campaigns helped reach blacks and teach them how to resist whites did impose racial segregation in public facilities and jim crow laws which effectively lasted until passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960sbaltimore grew significantly during the industrial revolution due in large part to its seaport and good railroad connections attracting european immigrant labor many manufacturing businesses were established in the baltimore area after the civil war baltimore businessmen including johns hopkins enoch pratt george peabody and henry walters founded notable city institutions that bear their names including a university library music school and art museumcumberland was marylands second-largest city in the 19th century nearby supplies of natural resources along with railroads fostered its growth into a major manufacturing centerthe progressive era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought political reforms in a series of laws passed between 1892 and 1908 reformers worked for standard state-issued ballots rather than those distributed and marked by the parties obtained closed voting booths to prevent party workers from assisting voters initiated primary elections to keep party bosses from selecting candidates and had candidates listed without party symbols which discouraged the illiterate from participating these measures worked against ill-educated whites and blacks blacks resisted such efforts with suffrage groups conducting voter education blacks defeated three efforts to disfranchise them making alliances with immigrants to resist various democratic campaigns disfranchising bills in 1905 1907 and 1911 were rebuffed in large part because of black opposition blacks comprised 20% of the electorate and immigrants comprised 15% and the legislature had difficulty devising requirements against blacks that did not also disadvantage immigrantsthe progressive era also brought reforms in working conditions for marylands labor force in 1902 the state regulated conditions in mines outlawed child laborers under the age of 12 mandated compulsory school attendance and enacted the nations first workers compensation law the workers compensation law was overturned in the courts but was redrafted and finally enacted in 1910the great baltimore fire of 1904 burned over 30 hours destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks more than 1,231 firefighters worked to bring the blaze under control with

eastern shore family farms were bought up by major concerns and large-scale poultry farms and vegetable farming became prevalent in southern maryland tobacco farming nearly vanished due to suburban development and a state tobacco buy-out programin an effort to reverse depopulation due to the loss of working-class industries baltimore initiated urban renewal projects in the 1960s with charles
