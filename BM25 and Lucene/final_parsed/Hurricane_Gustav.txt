the season gustav caused serious damage and casualties in haiti the dominican republic jamaica the cayman islands cuba and the united states gustav caused at least 6.6billion 2008usd in damagesit formed on the morning of august 25 2008 about 260 miles 420km southeast of port-au-prince haiti and rapidly strengthened into a tropical storm that afternoon and into a hurricane early on august 26 later that day it made landfall near the haitian town of jacmel it inundated jamaica and ravaged western cuba and then steadily moved across the gulf of mexicoonce into the gulf gustav gradually weakened because of increased wind shear and dry air it weakened to a category 2 hurricane late on august 31 and remained at that intensity until landfall on the morning of september 1 near cocodrie louisiana weakening continued and gustav weakened to a tropical storm that evening and to a tropical depression the next day as it meandered around the south-central us the weak system became extratropical on september 4 and was absorbed by another low on september 5in total an estimated 153 deaths had been attributed to gustav in the us and caribbean damage in the us totaled to 4.3billion 2008usd with additional damage of 2.1billion in cuba and 210million in damage in jamaicagustav formed out of a tropical wave that had previously produced t-rain and squalls in the lesser antilles it developed well-defined curved bands and briefly exhibited an upper-level eye feature the nhc designated it tropical depression seven and dispatched a hurricane hunter aircraft to investigate the system at the time the system had a well-defined outflow in all but the southeast and southwest quadrant and data from the hurricane-hunter aircraft confirmed that the tropical depression had strengthened into a tropical storm which was soon designated tropical storm gustav a brief period of disorganization proved to be temporary as a well-defined eye wall formed that same night in the early hours of august 26 as the storm approached haitis southwestern peninsula another hurricane hunter aircraft confirmed what forecasters already suspectedthat gustav had strengthened into a hurricane with winds topping 90mph 150kmh before reaching haiti its satellite presentation continued to intensify a central dense overcast became more prominent and the minimum central pressure fellhurricane gustav regained a pronounced eye as it made landfall on haiti with 75mph 121kmh winds near the town of jacmel as the hurricane moved over haitis mountainous terrain its circulation was disrupted and it lost a little strength although downgraded to a tropical storm it still had a pronounced eye in its mid- and upper-level structures its outflow improved throughout the night of august 26 and the system was not very disrupted when it moved back over water into the gulf of gonve however the storms movement slowed and continued interaction with nearby haiti combined with the incursion of mid-level dry air from the northeast resulted in further weakening during the day on august 27 the storm began a west-southwesterly movement that brought it closer to jamaica on the morning of august 28 it was found that overnight gustav had either reformed farther to the south or had moved farther to the south than previously thought the storm was also found to have restrengthened nearly to hurricane status it then was upgraded to a hurricane again during the late afternoon of august 29 at 11:00 am edt 1500utc on august 30 as gustav neared the west end of cuba it was upgraded to a category3 hurricane on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with sustained winds near 125mph 205kmh gustav continued its rapid deepening trend and three hours later it had already reached category4 strength gustavs maximum sustained winds had reached 155mph 250kmh with a minimum pressure of 941millibarson august 30 gustav made landfall twice on cuba first on isla de la juventud and then on the mainland near the community of los palacios in pinar del ro province by the early hours of august 31 gustav entered the gulf of mexico with maximum sustained winds of 135mph 217kmh and minimum central pressure of 958millibars during august 31 the storm moved in a northwest direction slightly losing its strength despite passing over a shortened loop current with sustained winds at 115mph on the evening of august 31 gustav weakened to a category 2 hurricane and remained at such intensity until landfall gustav made landfall along the louisiana coast with 105mph 170kmh winds near cocodrie at about 9:30 am cdt 1430utc by 10pm cdt gustav had been downgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 60mph 95kmh about 20miles 30km southwest of alexandria louisiana and by 4am cdt on september 2 gustav

of the dominican republic south of santo domingo to the haitian coast south of port-au-prince a tropical storm watch was issued for the haitian coast north of port-au-prince to the northern border with the dominican republic hours later when gustav was upgraded to a tropical storm the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane warningthe haitian government ordered emergency shelters to prepare the country is particularly vulnerable to floods and landslides as rainfall runs off its largely deforested mountains the

about the hurricane that moved toward our island and the feverish efforts of our civil defense castro writes instead the news services echoing a yankee press organization dedicated to the media war and campaigns against cuba reported about the defection of tv actor yamil jaled the yankee press organization appears to be an allusion to el nuevo herald which broke the news of jaleds arrival in miami what a patriot what a democrat what a brilliant example wrote castro this way the world is informed about a character a lot less known and important than hurricane gustav they want to make a sacred cow out of himbecause of the damage and deaths on april 22 2009 the name gustav was retired by the world meteorological organization it will never again be used to name an atlantic hurricane again it was replaced with gonzalo which was first used in 2014
