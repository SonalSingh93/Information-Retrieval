owed to williams father admiral william penn this was one of the largest land grants to an individual in history the king named it pennsylvania literally penns woods in honor of the admiral penn the son who wanted it to be called new wales and then sylvania from the latin silva forest woods was embarrassed at the change fearing that people would think he had named it after himself but king charles would not rename the grant penn established a government with two innovations that were much copied in the new world the county commission and freedom of religious convictionwhat had been upland on what became the pennsylvania side of the pennsylvania-delaware border was renamed as chester county when pennsylvania instituted their colonial governments on march 4 1681 the quaker leader william penn had signed a peace treaty with tammany leader of the delaware tribe beginning a long period of friendly relations between the quakers and the indians additional treaties between quakers and other tribes followed the treaty of william penn was never violatedbetween 1730 and when it was shut down by parliament with the currency act of 1764 the pennsylvania colony made its own paper money to account for the shortage of actual gold and silver the paper money was called colonial scrip the colony issued bills of credit which were as good as gold or silver coins because of their legal tender status since they were issued by the government and not a banking institution it was an interest-free proposition largely defraying the expense of the government and therefore taxation of the people it also promoted general employment and prosperity since the government used discretion and did not issue too much to inflate the currency benjamin franklin had a hand in creating this currency of which he said its utility was never to be disputed and it also met with the cautious approval of adam smithjames smith wrote that in 1763 the indians again commenced hostilities and were busily engaged in killing and scalping the frontier inhabitants in various parts of pennsylvania further this state was then a quaker government and at the first of this war the frontiers received no assistance from the state the ensuing hostilities became known as pontiacs warafter the stamp act congress of 1765 delegate john dickinson of philadelphia wrote the declaration of rights and grievances the congress was the first meeting of the thirteen colonies called at the request of the massachusetts assembly but only nine colonies sent delegates dickinson then wrote letters from a farmer in pennsylvania to the inhabitants of the british colonies which were published in the pennsylvania chronicle between december 2 1767 and february 15 1768when the founding fathers of the united states convened in philadelphia in 1774 12 colonies sent representatives to the first continental congress the second continental congress which also met in philadelphia in may 1775 drew up and signed the declaration of independence in philadelphia but when that city was captured by the british the continental congress escaped westward meeting at the lancaster courthouse on saturday september 27 1777 and then to york there they and its primary author john dickinson drew up the articles of confederation that formed 13 independent colonies into a new nation later the constitution was written and philadelphia was once again chosen to be cradle to the new american nation the constitution was drafted and signed at the pennsylvania state house now known as independence hall and the same building where the declaration of independence was signedpennsylvania became the first large state and the second state to ratify the us constitution on december 12 1787 five days after delaware became the first at the time it was the most ethically and religiously diverse of the thirteen colonies because one-third of pennsylvanias population spoke german the constitution was presented in german to include those citizens in the discussion reverend frederick muhlenberg acted as the chairman of the states ratifying conventiondickinson college of carlisle was the first college founded in the united states established in 1773 the college was ratified five days after the treaty of paris on september 9 1783 the school was founded by benjamin rush and named after john dickinsonfor half a century the commonwealths general assembly legislature met at various places in the general philadelphia area before starting to meet regularly in independence hall in philadelphia for 63 years but it needed a more central location as for example the paxton boys massacres of 1763 had made the legislature aware so in 1799 the general assembly moved to the lancaster courthouse and finally in 1812 to harrisburgthe general assembly met in the old dauphin county court house until december 1821 when the federal-style hills capitol named for its builder stephen hills a lancaster architect was constructed on a hilltop land grant of four acres set aside for a seat of state government by the prescient entrepreneurial son and namesake of john harris sr a yorkshire native who had founded a trading post in 1705 and ferry 1733 on the east shore of the susquehanna river the hills capitol burned down on february 2 1897 during a heavy snowstorm presumably because of a faulty flue the general assembly met at grace methodist church on state street still standing until a new capitol could be built following an architectural selection contest that many alleged had been rigged chicago architect henry ives cobb was charged with designing and building a replacement building however the legislature had little money to allocate to the project and a roughly finished somewhat industrial building the cobb capitol was completed the general assembly refused to occupy the building political and popular indignation in 1901 prompted a second contest that was restricted to pennsylvania architects and joseph miller huston of philadelphia was chosen to design the present pennsylvania state capitol that incorporated cobbs building into magnificent public work finished and dedicated in 1907the new state capitol drew rave reviews its dome was inspired by the domes of st peters basilica in rome and the united states capitol president theodore roosevelt called it the most beautiful state capital in the nation and said its the handsomest building i ever saw at the dedication in 1989 the new york times praised it as grand even awesome at moments but it is also a working building accessible to citizens  a building that connects with the reality of daily lifejames buchanan of franklin county the only bachelor president of the united states was the only one to be born in pennsylvania the battle of gettysburgthe major turning point of the civil wartook place near gettysburg an estimated 350,000 pennsylvanians served in the union army forces including 8,600 african
