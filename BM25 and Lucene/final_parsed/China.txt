model of portuguese  and french  portuguese china is thought to derive from persian chn  and perhaps ultimately from sanskrit cna  cna was first used in early hindu scripture including the mahbhrata 5th century and the laws of manu 2nd century in 1655 martino martini suggested that the word china is derived from the name of the qin dynasty 221206 bc a proposal supported by many later scholars although there are also a number of alternative suggestionsthe official name of the modern state is the peoples republic of china chinese  pinyin  the shorter form is china   from  central or middle and  state nation-state a term which developed under the zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne it was then applied to the area around luoyi present-day luoyang during the eastern zhou and then to chinas central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the qing it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the huaxia tribes from perceived barbarians and was the source of the english name  a more literary or inclusive name alluding to the land of chinese civilization is   it developed during the wei and jin dynasties as a contraction of the central state of the huaxia before the prcs establishment the proposed name of the country was the peoples democratic republic of china simplified chinese  traditional chinese  pinyin  during the

used fire were discovered in a cave at zhoukoudian near beijing they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago the fossilized teeth of homo sapiens dated to 125,00080,000 years ago have been discovered in fuyan cave in dao county hunan chinese proto-writing existed in jiahu around 7000 damaidi around 6000 dadiwan from 58005400 and banpo dating from the 5th millennium some scholars have suggested that the jiahu symbols 7th millennium constituted the earliest chinese writing systemaccording to chinese tradition the first dynasty was the xia which emerged around 2100 the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 1959 it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th century their oracle bone script from c represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese charactersthe shang were conquered by the zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords many independent states eventually emerged from the weakened zhou state and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year spring and autumn period only occasionally deferring to the zhou king by the time of the warring states period of the 5th3rd centuries there were seven powerful sovereign states in what is now china each with its own king ministry and armythe warring states period ended in 221 after the state of qin conquered the other six kingdoms and established the first unified chinese state king zheng of qin proclaimed himself the first emperor chinese  pinyin  of the qin dynasty he enacted qins legalist reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of chinese characters measurements road widths ie cart axles length and currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and vietnam the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperors death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellionfollowing a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burned the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206 and 220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese the han expanded the empires territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world despite the hans initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qins legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successorsafter the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in 581 the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture and economy constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war with korea provoked widespread unrestunder the succeeding tang and song dynasties chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age the tang empire returned control of the western regions and the silk road and made the capital changan a cosmopolitan urban center however it was devastated and weakened by the an shi rebellion in the 8th century in 907 the tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable the song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960 leading to a balance of power between the song and khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the tang and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the jurchen jin dynasty in 1127 emperor huizong of song and the capital bianjing were captured during the jinsong wars the remnants of the song retreated to southern chinathe 13th century brought the mongol conquest of china in 1271 the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in 1279 before the mongol invasion the population of song china was 120 million citizens this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300 a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that zheng he led treasure voyages throughout the world reaching as far as africain the early years of the ming dynasty chinas capital was moved from nanjing to beijing with the budding of capitalism philosophers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo-confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations the scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against japanese invasions of korea 159298 and manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasuryin 1644 beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew lis short-lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynastythe qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1912 was the last imperial dynasty of china its conquest of the ming 16181683 cost 25 million lives and the economy of china shrank drastically after the southern ming ended the further conquest of the dzungar khanate added mongolia tibet and xinjiang to the empire the centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti-qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce the haijin sea ban and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing social and technological stagnation in the mid-19th century the dynasty experienced western imperialism in the opium wars with britain and france china was forced to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede hong kong to the british under the 1842 treaty of nanking the first of the unequal treaties the first sino-japanese war 189495 resulted in qing chinas loss of influence in the korean peninsula as well as the cession of taiwan to japanthe qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the failed taiping rebellion that ravaged southern china in the 1850s and 1860s and the dungan revolt 186277 in the northwest the initial success of the self-strengthening movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890sin the 19th century the great chinese diaspora began losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the northern chinese famine of 187679 in which between 9 and 13 million people died the guangxu emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the empress dowager cixi the ill-fated anti-foreign boxer rebellion of 18991901 further weakened the dynasty although cixi sponsored a program of reforms the xinhai revolution of 191112 brought an end to the qing dynasty and established the republic of chinaon 1 january 1912 the republic of china was established and sun yat-sen of the kuomintang the kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself emperor of china in the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own beiyang army he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republicafter yuan shikais death in 1916 china was politically fragmented its beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory in the late 1920s the kuomintang under chiang kai-shek the then principal of the republic of china military academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings known collectively as the northern expedition the kuomintang moved the nations capital to nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat-sens san-min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state the political division in china made it difficult for chiang to battle the communist peoples liberation army pla against whom the kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the chinese civil war this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the pla retreated in the long march until japanese aggression and the 1936 xian incident forced chiang to confront imperial japanthe second sino-japanese war 19371945 a theater of world war ii forced an uneasy alliance between the kuomintang and the pla japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population in all as many as 20 million chinese civilians died an estimated 200,000 chinese were massacred in the city of nanjing alone during the japanese occupation during the war china along with the uk the us and the soviet union were referred to as trusteeship of the powerful and were recognized as the allied big four in the declaration by united nations along with the other three great powers china was one of the four major allies of world war ii and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war after the surrender of japan in 1945 taiwan including the pescadores was returned to chinese control china emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained the continued distrust between the kuomintang and the communists led to the resumption of civil war constitutional rule was established in 1947 but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the roc constitution were never implemented in mainland chinamajor combat in the chinese civil war ended in 1949 with the communist party in control of most of mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing the rocs territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands on 21 september 1949 communist party chairman mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the peoples republic of china this was followed by a mass celebration in tiananmen square on 1 october which became the new countrys first national day in 1950 the peoples liberation army succeeded in capturing hainan from the roc and incorporating tibet however remaining kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western china throughout the 1950s in modern us history studies the founding of prc china is often termed as the loss of china as reflected in us state policy documents of the time which thinkers such as chomsky call the beginning of mccarthyismthe regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform which saw between 1 and 2 million landlords executed under its leadership china developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons the chinese population almost doubled from around 550 million to over 900 million however the great leap forward a large-scale economic and social reform project resulted in an estimated 45million deaths between 1958 and 1961 mostly from starvation in 1966 mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval which lasted until maos death in 1976 in october 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china in the united nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the security councilafter maos death the gang of four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping took power in 1978 and instituted significant economic reforms the communist party loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of private land leases this marked chinas transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment china adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982 in 1989 the violent suppression of student protests in tiananmen square brought condemnation and sanctions against the chinese government from various countriesjiang zemin li peng and zhu rongji led the nation in the 1990s under their administration chinas economic performance pulled an estimated 150million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2% the country formally joined the world trade organization in 2001 and maintained its high rate of economic growth under hu jintao and wen jiabaos leadership in the 2000s however rapid growth also severely impacted the countrys resources and environment and caused major social displacement living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late-2000s recession but centralized political control remained tightpreparations for a decadal communist party leadership change in 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals during chinas 18th national communist party congress in november 2012 hu jintao was replaced as general secretary of the communist party by xi jinping under xi the chinese government began large-scale efforts to reform its economy which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth the xili administration also announced major reforms to the one-child policy and prison systemchinas landscape is vast and diverse ranging from the gobi and taklamakan deserts in the arid north to subtropical forests in the wetter south the himalaya karakoram pamir and tian shan mountain ranges separate china from much of south and central asia the

14,500 kilometers 9,000mi long and is bounded by the bohai yellow east china and south china seas china connects through the kazakh border to the eurasian steppe which has been an artery of communication between east and west since the neolithic through the steppe route  the ancestor of the terrestrial silk roadsthe peoples republic of china is the second-largest country in the world by land area after russia and is either the third- or fourth-largest by total area after russia canada and depending on the definition of total area the united states chinas total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000km 3,700,000sqmi specific area figures range from 9,572,900km 3,696,100sqmi according to the encyclopdia britannica 9,596,961km 3,705,407sqmi according to the un

additionally china shares maritime boundaries with south korea japan vietnam and the philippinesthe territory of china lies between latitudes 18 and 54 n and longitudes 73 and 135 e chinas landscapes vary significantly across its vast width in the east along the shores of the yellow sea and the east china sea there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains while on the edges of the inner mongolian plateau in the north broad grasslands predominate southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges while the central-east hosts the deltas of chinas two major rivers the yellow river and the yangtze river other major rivers include the xi mekong brahmaputra and amur to the west sit major mountain ranges most notably the himalayas high plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the taklamakan and the gobi desert the worlds highest point mount everest 8,848m lies on the sino-nepalese border the countrys lowest point and the worlds third-lowest is the dried lake bed of ayding lake 154m in the turpan depressionchinas climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer in the winter northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist the climate in china differs from region to region because of the countrys highly complex topographya major environmental issue in china is the continued expansion of its deserts particularly the gobi desert although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern china each spring which then spread to other parts of east asia including korea and japan chinas environmental watchdog sepa stated in 2007 that china is losing 4,000km 1,500sqmi per year to desertification water quality erosion and pollution control have become important issues in chinas relations with other countries melting glaciers in the himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of peoplechina is one of 17 megadiverse countries lying in two of the worlds major ecozones the palearctic and the indomalaya by one measure china has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world after brazil and colombia the country signed the rio de janeiro convention on biological diversity on 11 june 1992 and became a party to the

species of mammals the third-highest such number in the world 1,221 species of birds eighth 424 species of reptiles seventh and 333 species of amphibians seventh china is the most biodiverse country in each category outside the tropics wildlife in china share habitat with and bear acute pressure from the worlds largest population of homo sapiens at least 840 animal species are threatened vulnerable or in danger of local extinction in china due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction pollution and poaching for food fur and ingredients for traditional chinese medicine

of all the animal and plant species found in china china has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi and of them nearly 6,000 are higher fungiin recent decades china has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution while regulations such as the 1979 environmental protection law are fairly stringent they are poorly enforced as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country the world bank estimated in 2013 that 16 of the worlds 20 most-polluted cities are located in china china is the worlds largest carbon dioxide emitter the country also has significant water pollution problems 40% of chinas rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste by late 2011 in 2014 the internal freshwater resources per capita of china reduced to 2,062m and it was below 500m in the north china plain while 5,920m in the

invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects by 2015 over 24% of chinas energy was derived from renewable sources while most notably from hydroelectric power a total installed capacity of 197 gw makes china the largest hydroelectric power producer in the world china also has the largest power capacity of installed solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world in 2011 the chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan us619 billion in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a ten-year period and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought system by 2020 in 2013 china began a five-year us277 billion effort to reduce air pollution particularly in the north of the countrychinas constitution states that the peoples republic of china is a socialist state under the peoples democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants and that the state organs apply the principle of democratic centralism the prc is one of the worlds few remaining socialist states openly endorsing communism see ideology of the communist party of china the chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist but also as authoritarian and corporatist with heavy restrictions in many areas most notably against free access to the internet freedom of the press freedom of assembly the right to have children free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion its current political ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as the peoples democratic dictatorship socialism with chinese characteristics which is marxism adapted to chinese circumstances and the socialist market economy respectivelychinas constitution declares that the country is ruled under the leadership of the communist party of china cpc as china is a de facto one-party state the general secretary party leader holds ultimate power and authority over state and government serving as the paramount leader the electoral system is pyramidal local peoples congresses are directly elected and higher levels of peoples congresses up to the national peoples congress npc are indirectly elected by the peoples congress of the level immediately below the political system is decentralized and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a significant amount of autonomy another eight political parties have representatives in the npc and the chinese peoples political consultative conference cppcc china supports the leninist principle of democratic centralism but critics describe the elected national peoples congress as a rubber stamp bodythe president of china is the titular head of state serving as the ceremonial figurehead under national peoples congress the premier of china is the head of government presiding over the state council composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions the incumbent president is xi jinping who is also the general secretary of the communist party of china and the chairman of the central military commission making him chinas paramount leader the incumbent premier is li keqiang who is also a senior member of the cpc politburo standing committee chinas de facto top decision-making bodythere have been some moves toward political liberalization in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels however the party retains effective control over government appointments in the absence of meaningful opposition the cpc wins by default most of the time political concerns in china include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption nonetheless the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high with 8095% of chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government according to a 2011 surveythe peoples republic of china is divided into 22 provinces five autonomous regions each with a designated minority group four municipalities and two special administrative regions sars which enjoy a degree of political autonomy these 31 provincial-level divisions can be collectively referred to as mainland china a term which usually excludes two sars of hong kong and macau geographically all 31 provincial divisions can be grouped into six regions including north china northeast china east china south central china southwest china and northwest chinachina considers taiwan to be its 23rd province although taiwan is governed by the republic of china which disputes the prcs claim none of the divisions are recognized by the roc government which claims the entirety of the prcs territorythe prc has diplomatic relations with 175 countries and maintains embassies in 162 its legitimacy is disputed by the republic of china and a few other countries it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition in 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china as the sole representative of china in the united nations and as one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council china was also a former member and leader of the non-aligned movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries along with brazil russia india and south africa china is a member of the brics group of emerging major economies and hosted the groups third official summit at sanya hainan in april 2011under its interpretation of the one-china policy beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the republic of china chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to taiwan especially in the matter of armament salesmuch of current chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on premier zhou enlais five principles of peaceful coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences this policy may have led china to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by western nations such as zimbabwe north korea and iran china has a close economic and military relationship with russia and the two states often vote in unison in the un security councilin recent decades china has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its asia-pacific neighbours china became a member of the world trade organization wto on 11 december 2001 in 2004 it proposed an entirely new east asia summit eas framework as a forum for regional security issues the eas which includes asean plus three india australia and new zealand held its inaugural summit in 2005 china is also a founding member of the shanghai cooperation organization sco along with russia and the central asian republicsin 2000 the united states congress approved permanent normal trade relations pntr with china allowing chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries china has a significant trade surplus with the united states its most important export market in the early 2010s us politicians argued that the chinese yuan was significantly undervalued giving china an unfair trade advantage in recent decades china has followed a policy of engaging with african nations for trade and bilateral co-operation in 2012 sino-african trade totalled over us160 billion china has furthermore strengthened its ties with major south american economies becoming the largest trading partner of brazil and building strategic links with argentinaever since its establishment after the second chinese civil war the prc has claimed the territories governed by the republic of china roc a separate political entity today commonly known as taiwan as a part of its territory it regards the island of taiwan as its taiwan province kinmen and matsu as a part of fujian province and islands the roc controls in the south china sea as a part of hainan province and guangdong province these claims are controversial because of the complicated cross-strait relations with the prc treating the one-china policy as one of its most important diplomatic principlesin addition to taiwan china is also involved in other international territorial disputes since the 1990s china has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with india and an undefined border with bhutan china is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the east and south china seas such as the senkaku islands and the scarborough shoal on 21 may 2014 xi jinping speaking at a conference in shanghai pledged to settle chinas territorial disputes peacefully china stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests he saidchina is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt chinas growth as the century progresses some authors also question the definition of superpower arguing that chinas large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the united statesthe chinese democracy movement social activists and some members of the communist party of china have all identified the need for social and political reform while economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in china since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted the constitution of the peoples republic of china states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights however in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling communist party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most notably on the internet are routinely used to prevent collective action in 2005 reporters without borders ranked china 159th out of 167 states in its annual world press freedom index indicating a very low level of press freedom in 2014 china ranked 175th out of 180 countriesrural migrants to chinas cities often find themselves treated as second-class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits property rights are often poorly protected and taxation disproportionately affects poorer citizens however a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellersa number of foreign governments foreign press agencies and ngos also routinely criticize chinas human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced abortions forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights and excessive use of the death penalty the government has suppressed popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the tiananmen square protests of 1989falun gong was first taught publicly in 1992 in 1999 when there were 70 million practitioners the persecution of falun gong began resulting in mass arrests extralegal detention and reports of torture and deaths in custody the chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in tibet and xinjiang including violent police crackdowns and religious suppressionthe chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a countrys present level of economic development it emphasizes the rise in the chinese standard of living literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial yangtze river floods furthermore some chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization although others remain more conservative some major reform efforts have been conducted for an instance in november 2013 the government announced plans to relax the one-child policy and abolish the much-criticized re-education through labour program though human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic during the 2000s and early 2010s the chinese government was increasingly tolerant of ngos that offer practical efficient solutions to social problems but such third sector activity remained heavily regulatedwith 2.3 million active troops the peoples liberation army pla is the largest standing military force in the world commanded by the

budgetas a recognized nuclear weapons state china is considered both a major regional military power and a potential military superpower according to a 2013 report by the us department of defense china fields between 50 and 75 nuclear icbms along with a number of srbms however compared with the other four un security council permanent members china has relatively limited power projection capabilities to offset this it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s  its first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012 and it maintains a substantial fleet of submarines including several nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines china has furthermore established a network of foreign military relationships along critical sea laneschina has made significant progress in modernising its air force in recent decades purchasing russian fighter jets such as the sukhoi su-30 and also manufacturing its own modern fighters most notably the chengdu j-10 j-20 and the shenyang j-11 j-15 j-16 and j-31 china is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones air and sea denial weaponry advances

republic of china was a soviet-style centrally planned economy following maos death in 1976 and the consequent end of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping and the new chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market-oriented mixed economy under one-party rule agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized while foreign trade became a major new focus leading to the creation of special economic zones sezs inefficient state-owned enterprises soes were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright resulting in massive job losses modern-day china is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism the state still dominates in strategic pillar sectors such as energy production and heavy industries but private enterprise has expanded enormously with around 30million private businesses recorded in 2008since economic liberalization began in 1978 china has been among the worlds fastest-growing economies relying largely on investment- and export-led growth according to the imf chinas annual average gdp growth between 2001 and 2010

until the ming dynasty ancient chinese discoveries and inventions such as papermaking printing the compass and gunpowder the four great inventions became widespread in asia and later to the europe chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers by the 17th century the western world had surpassed china in scientific and technological development the causes of this great divergence continue to be debatedafter repeated military defeats by western nations in the 19th century chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the self-strengthening movement after the communists came to power in 1949 efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the soviet union in which scientific research was part of central planning after maos death in 1976 science and technology was established as one of the four modernizations and the soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformedsince the end of the cultural revolution china has made significant investments in scientific research with 163 billion spent on scientific research and development in 2012 science and technology are seen as vital for achieving chinas economic and political goals and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as techno-nationalism nonetheless chinas investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the united states and japan chinese-born scientists have won the nobel prize in physics four times the nobel prize in chemistry and physiology or medicine

greatly valued in china todaythe first leaders of the peoples republic of china were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the may fourth movement and reformist ideals they sought to change some traditional aspects of chinese culture such as rural land tenure sexism and the confucian system of education while preserving others such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state some observers see the period following the establishment of the prc in 1949 as a continuation of traditional chinese dynastic history while others claim that the communist partys rule has damaged the foundations of chinese culture especially through political movements such as the cultural revolution of the 1960s where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed having been denounced as regressive and harmful or vestiges of feudalism many important aspects of traditional chinese morals and culture such as confucianism art literature and performing arts like
