hurricane wilma  wikipedia hurricane wilma was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded in the atlantic basin as well as the most intense recorded in the western hemisphere until hurricane patricia in 2015 part of the record-breaking 2005 atlantic hurricane season which included three of the top ten most intense atlantic hurricanes ever along with 4 rita and 7 katrina wilma was the twenty-second storm thirteenth hurricane sixth major hurricane fourth category 5 hurricane and second-most destructive hurricane of the 2005 season a tropical depression formed in the caribbean sea near jamaica on october 15 headed westward and two days later intensified into a tropical storm which turned abruptly southward and was named wilma wilma continued to strengthen and eventually became a hurricane on october 18 shortly thereafter explosive intensification occurred and in only 24 hours wilma became a category 5 hurricane with wind speeds of 185 miles per hour 298kmhwilmas intensity slowly leveled off after becoming a category 5 hurricane and winds had decreased to 150 miles per hour 240kmh before it reached the yucatn peninsula on october 20 and 21 after crossing the yucatn wilma emerged into the gulf of mexico as a category 2 hurricane as wilma began accelerating to the northeast gradual re-intensification occurred and the hurricane was upgraded to category 3 on october 24 shortly thereafter wilma made landfall in cape romano florida with winds of 120 miles per hour 190kmh as wilma was crossing florida it briefly weakened back to a category 2 hurricane but again re-intensified as it reached the atlantic ocean the hurricane intensified into a category 3 hurricane for the last time but dropped below that intensity while accelerating northeastward by october 26 wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of nova scotiawilma made several landfalls with the most destructive effects felt in the yucatn peninsula of mexico cuba and the us state of florida at least 62 deaths were reported and damage total estimated at 29.4billion equivalent to 36.1billion in 2017 with in the united states 21billion 25.8billion in 2017 as a result wilma is ranked as the sixth costliest hurricane in united states history wilma was the most recent major hurricane to make landfall in the contiguous united states until hurricane harvey made landfall in southern texas on august 26 2017 ending a record length of time  slightly over 11 years and 10 months  without any major hurricanes making landfall in the united states wilma was also the last hurricane to strike the state of florida until hurricane hermine did so nearly 11 years later in 2016 another record wilma was also the last major hurricane to make landfall in florida until hurricane irma made landfall in early september 2017a large area of disturbed weather developed across much of the caribbean sea during mid-october as a lower-tropospheric low interacted with a broad area of disturbed weather aided by an upper-level low across the region a broad area of low pressure developed on october 13 to the southeast of jamaica and slowly became more concentrated as upper-level wind shear gradually decreased dvorak classifications began on october 14 and by late october 15 the surface circulation in the system became well enough defined with sufficiently organized deep convection for the national hurricane center to designate the system as tropical depression twenty-four while located about 220mi 350km east-southeast of grand caymanthe depression drifted southwestward because of the influence of two ridges to its north and with warm sea surface temperatures and a favorable upper-level environment it strengthened into tropical storm wilma on october 17 initially development was slow due to the large size of the storm and a flat pressure gradient however convection gradually organized and from october 18 through october 19 wilma underwent explosive deepening over the open waters of the caribbean sea around 12:00utc on october18 the system intensified into a hurricane in a 30hour period the pressure dropped from 982mbar hpa 29.00inhg to the record-low of 882mbar hpa 26.05inhg while the winds increased to 185mph 295kmh during its intensification on october19 the hurricanes eye shrank to as small as 2.3mi 3.7km in diameter becoming the smallest eye ever seen in a tropical cycloneon october20 wilma weakened below category 5 intensity to 155mph 250kmh due to an eyewall replacement cycle began to turn towards the northwest and further slowed its movement late on october21 wilma made landfall on the island of cozumel quintana roo at around 21:45utc with maximum sustained winds of 150mph 240kmh and then again made a second landfall on the mexican mainland six hours later and only slightly weaker wilma continued to slowly drift towards the north over the yucatn peninsula although it weakened to a moderate hurricane while over land it reemerged over the southern gulf of mexico on october 23 around 00:00utc despite wilma spending 24 hours over land it remerged with little intensity lost and began to re-intensify shortly after this was perhaps due to its large size and because the majority of its circulation remained over the warm waters of the northwest caribbean and gulf of mexico a powerful trough turned the hurricane to the northeast and accelerated its forward motion its large eye remained well-organized and wilma intensified despite increasing amounts of wind shear briefly producing winds of 125mph 200kmh before making landfall on cape romano florida as a 120mph 195kmh major hurricanewilma crossed the state in about 4.6hours and weakened to a category 2 hurricane with winds of 110mph 175kmh after entering the atlantic ocean near jupiter florida key west received several feet of water in the low-lying areas and flooded homes the lower keys also experienced an unusual flood it occurred twice first as the storm approached florida it pushed water across the keys from south to north as the storm finally crossed into the everglades all the water that had been pushed by the storm was released as wilma crossed the peninsula the water then raced back across the lower keys a second time and went back out to sea this caused additional flooding and costly damage possibly due to less friction of the eyewall or moving over warm waters of the gulf stream wilma again re-intensified to reach winds of 125mph 200kmh and subsequently absorbed tropical storm alpha to the south before cold air and wind shear penetrated the inner core of convection on october 26 wilma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and on the next day the remnants of wilma were absorbed by another extratropical storm over atlantic canadathe national hurricane center nhc issued many tropical cyclone warnings and watches throughout wilmas duration at 09:00utc on october16 a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning were posted for the cayman islands a tropical storm warning was issued in honduras from the border with nicaragua westward to cabo camaron at 15:00utc on october17 the hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for the

24hours before wilma made its closest approach to the archipelago the government of the bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory including the abacos andros island berry islands bimini eleuthera grand bahama and new providence the government of the bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion though many failed to fully prepare believing wilma would pass through the region as a tropical storm many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters as well officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of grand bahama island and established multiple shelters on the island evacuations were minimal it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left as most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane hardware stores and food markets were generally well-stockedwilma was responsible for 87 total deaths and almost 29.4billion 2005 us in damagesin haiti the outer bands of wilma triggered mudslides killing at least 12people damage in the country totaled around 500,000 2005usdwilma caused one death in jamaica as a tropical depression on october 16 it pounded the island for three days ending on october 18 flooding several low-lying communities and triggering mudslides that blocked roads and damaged several homes almost 250people were in emergency shelters on the island damage on the island totaled 93.5million 2005usdat least eight deaths were reported in mexico five were in the playa del carmen area due to a gas explosion caused by the strong winds four deaths also were reported in cozumel and another in cancn due to wind blowing a window out another death caused by a falling tree was reported in the state of yucatnpictures and television reports indicated extensive structural damage throughout the cancn area as well as significant flooding and many downed trees power lines and scattered debris several homes had also collapsed rainfall amounts in excess of 23inches 590mm were reported in several areas with isla mujeres reporting 64inches 1,625.6mmfive times what hurricane gilbert dropped the station recorded 64.33inches 1,633.98mm over 24hours setting a western hemisphere record for the greatest rainfall in that time period one gymnasium used as a shelter lost its roof which forced the evacuation of more than 1,000people staying there during the storm waves five to eight meters high enough to reach the third floor of many hotels slammed against the coastline damage was extensive as well on cozumel with many broken windows fallen trees and power lines but less structural damage it was comparable to the scene after hurricane emily back in july 2005 a storm of similar intensity at landfall but faster movingthe governor of quintana roo flix gonzlez canto said in an interview never in the history of quintana roo have we seen a storm like thiscommunication was initially limited as telephone and electric services were completely out in the affected areas however in downtown cancn some telephone communications remained intact and tourists went out and risked their lives to contact home there were also extensive reports of looting of many businesses in quintana roo particularly in cancnafter wilma passed a sense of desperation developed in the region because people were being held in shelters due to the extensive damage thousands of tourists remained stranded in shelters and the priority was to send them home immediately according to president vicente fox buses arrived in cancn from mrida where tourists were hoping to find flights home the united states embassy told tourists to go to mrida although the next day they had to change their announcements because mrida had become so packed with people the road to mrida was very dangerous and practically impassable for taxis yet people dealt with the exorbitant fees being charged for passagethe destruction left behind by wilma in the yucatn severely damaged the tourist industry there as the storm affected some of the tourist hot spots of mexico damage in mexico totaled 7.5billion 2005usd 80billion 2005 mxn of which 4.6billion 2005usd 50billion 2005 mxn was from agricultural damagein cuba a bus carrying evacuees crashed killing four people including three foreign touristscoastal flooding caused by wilmas storm surge and flooding from the outer bands was reported in many areas particularly around havana more than 250 homes were heavily flooded and rescuers required scuba gear inflatable rafts and amphibious vehicles to reach the most severely flooded areas havana was also without power and wind damage was reported as a result of winds up to 85mph 140kmh officials in cuba estimated total damage to be about 700millionat least five hurricane-related deaths were reported in the united states all in florida and there were at least 26 deaths indirectly related to wilma damage from wilma was extensive and widespread over south florida due to winds and flooding after the hurricane had passed a storm surge from the backwash of up to 8ft 2.4m from the gulf of mexico inundated a large portion of the lower keys the peak of the storm surge occurred when the eye of wilma had already passed over the naples area and the sustained winds during the surge were less than 40mph 64kmhhurricane wilma caused widespread destruction of critical infrastructure including power water and sewer systems florida power and light the largest electricity utility in the state reported more than 3,241,000 customers had lost power equivalent to approximately 6,000,000people with most residents getting power restored in 815days running water was restored for most residents within 2days broward and palm beach counties were hit particularly hard by the many tornadoes in the western portion of the hurricane most notably in downtown fort lauderdale there was significant damage to older buildings including the broward county courthouse school board building and taller area office buildings built before the implementation of stricter building codes after hurricane andrew the glass facades in a number of downtown buildings notably the templeton building were sheared off by high winds damage in florida totaled 16.8 billion 2005usdfew reports of effects from hurricane wilma exist in the united states outside of florida with minimal impact other than rain recorded in other states rainfall had extended into georgia north carolina south carolina and virginia only a few areas had observed rain greater than twoinches 51mm although only onetwoinches 2551mm were reported in georgia and south carolina hurricane wilma dropped approximately threeinches 76mm of rain on the outer banks of north carolina on october 25the remnants of wilma combined with a noreaster resulting in rainfall snow and strong winds across the mid-atlantic and new englandin connecticut strong winds felled tree limbs trees and electrical wires resulting in scattered power outages in ashford pomfret and wethersfield rainfall of 2 to 3 inches 51 to 76mm in litchfield county caused the housatonic river to reach a crest of 7.18ft 2.19m at falls village late on october26 minor flooding was reported in the county strong winds in rhode island knocked down a large tree onto interstate 95 in providence blocking a few northbound lanes additionally several trees power lines and tree limbs were downed in exeter tiverton west greenwich and woonsocketin massachusetts there was between 2 and 2.5in 51 and 64mm of rain damaging winds and coastal flooding in the eastern half of the state wind gusts between 44 and 47mph 71 and 76kmh were common with a gust as strong as 66mph 106kmh was recorded at the blue hill meteorological observatory in milton the strong winds downed limbs trees and wires resulting in thousands of people without power in addition a trailer was blown over on the bourne bridge a tree struck a car in fall river while trees fell on

marblehead marshfield nantucket salem scituate experienced coastal flooding several boats broke from their moorings and washed ashorethe remnants of wilma and the noreaster brought snowfall to southern vermont from october25 to october26 up to 20in 510mm of snow was accumulated at higher elevations in maine wind gusts between 55 and 65mph 89 and 105kmh occurred near the coast particularly in the down east region the combination of strong winds and saturated ground from prior heavy rainfall over a period of several weeks caused trees and many branches to topple these falling trees and limbs downed many power lines resulting in numerous electrical outages farther inland the two systems left 3 to 8in 76 to 203mm of snow in many areas and localized totals of 12 to 16in 300 to 410mm across higher terrain the snow brought down trees and power lines leaving about 25,000 customers lost power for varying amounts of time during the stormwhile passing the bahamas the hurricane produced hurricane-force winds and a powerful storm surge flooding southwestern coastal areas of grand bahama and destroying hundreds of buildings in western settlements on the island of grand bahama graves were washed up with skeletal remains lying in the streets damage totaled about 100million 2005usd 105million 2007usd almost entirely on the western half of the island the central portion of grand bahama including in and around freeport reported minor to moderate damage while the eastern end received little to no damage one child died on the island from the flooding elsewhere in the bahamas moderate damage occurred on bimini and abaco while islands farther to the south reported minimal wind damagewilma struck the bahamas during the filming of disneys pirates of the caribbean dead mans chest the service roads were destroyed and several trailers turned over the two principal ships the black pearl and the flying dutchman were relatively undamaged and the cast and crew were evacuated on the friday before the hurricane hitfloridas sugar industry was greatly affected the cropping had already started and had to be halted indefinitely damage to sugarcane crops was critical and widespread citrus canker spread rapidly throughout southern florida following hurricane wilma creating further hardships on an already stressed citrus economy due to damage from wilma and previous years hurricanes citrus production estimates fell to a low of 158million boxes for the 20052006 production seasons from a high of 240million for 20032004in january 2006 artists were invited to exhibit sculptures inspired by the storm in an outdoor exhibit at fort zachary taylor near the new nws hurricane and weather forecasting center in key west floridaby late-september 2010 roughly 9.2billion had been paid for more than 1million insurance claims that had been filed throughout florida in relation to hurricane wilmathe popular mexican resort towns of playa del carmen cozumel and cancn all suffered significant damage from wilma causing a major loss of tourism income the mtv video music awards latin america 2005 was to be held wednesday october 19 at the xcaret eco park close to playa del carmen in quintana roo mexico the 2005 edition of these awards was postponed however because of the approach of hurricane wilma toward the mexican riviera maya mtv had moved the date from october 20 to 19 in an attempt to avoid the hurricane but eventually decided to cancel the show the 2005 edition eventually took place using a modified format on december 22the united states offered emergency aid to cuba and to the surprise of the state department the cuban government accepted many times in the past including during hurricane dennis the united states offered aid but the cuban government declined the state department sent three damage assessors to havana to determine their needsdue to significant damage in mexico and florida the name wilma was officially retired in april 2006 by the world meteorological organization and will never be used for an atlantic storm again it was replaced by whitney in 2011the storm was named wilma the first time the w name was used in the atlantic basin since alphabetical naming began in 1950 with wilma the 2005 hurricane season broke the record for most storms in a season previously held by the 1933 season moving slowly over warm water with little wind shear wilma strengthened steadily and became a hurricane on october 18 the thirteenth hurricane of the season wilma broke the record set in 1969 for most storms of hurricane strength in one season for the atlantic basinthe barometric pressure measured in wilma 882mbar 26.05inhg is currently the lowest recorded pressure for a tropical cyclone in the atlantic basin as well as the second-lowest pressure for any cyclone measured in the western hemisphere only after hurricane patricia ten years later in the eastern pacific it also reached its 882mbar 26.05inhg pressure in a span of 24hours making it the fastest pressure drop of any storm in the atlantic basin although hurricane felix of 2007 reached a greater windspeed rise in 51hours at its peak intensity the eye of wilma was about 2.3 miles 3.7km in diameter the smallest known eye of a tropical cyclone in mexico isla mujeres reported 64inches 1,625.6mm of rainfallfive times what hurricane gilbert dropped this set a 24-hour rainfall record for the country of mexico and was the highest point total for rainfall from a tropical cyclone since hurricane mitch in 1998 wilma is also the costliest hurricane in mexican historywilma was the first retired w name since the world meteorological organization started retiring names in 1954 it was the strongest atlantic hurricane to be retired and when it was retired it made 2005 the season with the most retired names with five the old record was a three-way tie with four names retired in 1955 1995 and 2004 wilma was replaced with the name whitney had the unnamed 2005 azores subtropical storm been operationally recognized it would have been named subtropical storm tammy and storms forming after october4 would have been moved one name down the list wilma would have consequently been given the name alpha in accordance with the convention to name tropical cyclones after the greek alphabet if the scheduled list of names runs out
