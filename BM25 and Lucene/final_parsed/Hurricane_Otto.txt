hurricane otto  wikipedia hurricane otto was the first tropical cyclone since hurricane cesardouglas in 1996 to survive the crossover from the atlantic ocean to the pacific ocean forming late on november20 in the southwestern caribbean sea otto was the fifteenth and final named storm seventh hurricane and fourth major hurricane of the 2016 atlantic hurricane season it quickly intensified into a strong tropical storm the next day and on november2324 rapidly strengthened into a category 3 major hurricane the first in the month of november since hurricane paloma in 2008 and the latest date an atlantic hurricane attained such intensity on record otto made landfall in nicaragua at peak intensity on november24 thus becoming the latest hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin since 1851 when records began traveling along the nicaraguacosta rica border the system rapidly weakened to a tropical storm before emerging over the eastern pacific ocean becoming the final storm of the 2016 pacific hurricane season as well hostile environmental conditions inhibited reorganization and otto subsequently degenerated into an elongated trough on november26the hurricanes unusually southern formation in the caribbean sea led to impacts in countries rarely affected by tropical cyclones in particular panama and costa rica suffered extensive damage the storm claimed at least 23lives 10 in costa rica 9 in panama and 4 in nicaragua otto also dropped torrential rainfall across the affected regions some areas received up towards a months worth of rain in only a matter of a day which led to life-threatening flooding which in turn led to landslides after the storm had passed recovery efforts begun with the national mourning of the victims followed by clean-up efforts overall total economic losses from the hurricane exceeded us190millionon november12 the national hurricane center nhc first noted the potential for a low pressure area to develop in the southwestern caribbean sea assessing a low probability for tropical cyclone formation within five days after a convectively coupled kelvin wave and several nearby tropical waves interacted with each other in the aforementioned area atmospheric pressure in that region began falling on november14 resulting in a broad low pressure area forming north of colombia on november 15 the low moved slowly and erratically with a disorganized structure and light winds disrupted by unfavorable upper-level conditions on november19 the convection increased and became better organized amid marginally favorable conditions the hurricane hunters flew into the system on november20 observing a well-defined circulation and the system became a tropical depression at 18:00utc that daythe nascent depression meandered over the southwestern caribbean sea its path to the north blocked by a ridge thunderstorm activity continued to pulse over the center and the inner core of convection became more organized the depression intensified into a tropical storm by 06:00utc on november21 receiving the name otto the storm had well-established outflow to the northeast fueled by warm water temperatures of around 84f 29c after the convection organized into a central dense overcast otto became a strong tropical storm with 70mph 110kmh winds and maintained that intensity for about a day on november 23 the storm reached hurricane intensity and began a period of rapid intensification reaching category 2 intensity by 06:00utc the following day with winds of 105mph 165kmh six hours later otto reached its peak intensity as a category 3 major hurricane with winds of 115mph 185kmh becoming the latest major hurricane on record in the satellite era at 17:30utc otto made landfall over the indio maz biological reserve in southeastern nicaragua roughly 12 miles 19km northwest of the nicaraguacosta rica border at peak intensity this marked the southernmost landfall of a hurricane in central america since reliable records began eclipsing hurricane ireneolivia of 1971 by 30 to 35 miles 50 to 55kmafter landfall ottos structure remained well-organized as it moved roughly parallel to the costa rica-nicaraguan border although cloud tops warmed indicating diminishing convection despite moving over land the hurricanes eye remained well-defined and intact as it traversed nicaragua and costa rica otto was the first atlantic hurricane on record to have its eye cross over costa rica and the first hurricane-force system to traverse the nation around 03:30utc on november25 the eye of otto emerged over the eastern pacific near the gulf of papagayo completing a rare crossover from the atlantic to eastern pacific basinthe first such occurrence in which an atlantic tropical cyclone retained its name after a change in nhc naming policy in 2000 concurrently the system weakened to a tropical storm continuing to move westwards due to the influence of a subtropical ridge to its north otto steadily weakened as it moved away from central america unfavorable environmental conditions hastened the systems demise and otto weakened to a tropical depression on november26 soon thereafter the system degraded into a trough roughly 490mi 790km south of salina cruz mexico the remnant system continued to produce scattered convection for a few more days before dissipating entirelyin bocas del toro preparations were made even though otto was not expected to directly make landfall in the region several patients were evacuated from hospitals the nation was put on hurricane alert according to panamanian president juan carlos varela in a press conference varela stated that up to 600 relief units had been prepared in advance classes were also suspended in all public and private schools nationwidethe outer bands of otto caused extensive damage in panama at least nine people died in various incidents related to the storm high winds downed trees in panama city one of which fell on a car killing a child landslides claimed three lives two people drowned while trying to cross a swollen swift-moving river on the outskirts of panama city offshore the ship jessica sank with six crew three perished while the other three were rescued after clinging to inflatable raftsa hurricane watch was issued for the coast of nicaragua on november 22 which was upgraded into a warning the next day schools were closed for the coming days as otto approached and about 10,000 were in the process of being evacuated officials also feared that otto could damage the nations coffee crops which were close to being able to fully harvestrainfall across nicaragua generally amounted to 3 to 6in 76 to 152mm in southern and southwestern portions of the country a peak value of 6.35in 161mm was observed in el castillo throughout the country otto damaged 857houses eight schools and two health facilities the storm passage caused 11,678people to stay in 152temporary shelters after the storm 248people remained in the shelters while their damaged houses were rebuilt otto damaged 1,700m 5,600ft of power lines resulting in power and water outages officials deployed 12,000people to help ensure public safety and rescue efforts there were four deaths in nicaragua related to the hurricane with five others missing as of november26in costa rica the government declared red alert for the northern portion of the national territory and the southern pacific region about 6,800 people were evacuated to safer locations costa rica president luis guillermo sols also issued a state of emergency and advised all vehicles to stay off the roads and that hospitals in the most at-risk areas were having their patients transferred somewhere else he also advised that the hurricane could damage the agriculture supply in the nationotto was the first hurricane to pass directly over costa rica since records began in costa rica some areas near the border with nicaragua observed over a months worth of rainfall three-day accumulations exceeded 8in 200mm in many areas the highest recorded total was 12.11in 308mm at the miravalles volcano the national meteorological institute of costa rica reported that otto killed at least ten people in the country mostly from flash flooding and landsides including six in upala three in bagaces and one in guayabo costa rican president luis guillermo solis described the situation as chaotic and unprecedented with the worst effects in upala canton authorities calculated at least 106 billion colnes us190million in damages across the country including us68million in upala canton
