anticyclonic storm  wikipedia an anticyclonic storm is a weather storm where winds around the storm flow in the direction opposite to that of the flow about a region of low pressurein the northern hemisphere anticyclonic storms involve clockwise wind flow in the southern hemisphere they involve counterclockwise wind flowanticyclonic storms usually form around high-pressure systems these do not contradict the coriolis effect it predicts such anticyclonic flow about high-pressure regions anticyclonic storms as high-pressure systems usually accompany cold weather and are frequently a factor in large snowstorms jupiters great red spot is a well-known extraterrestrial example of an anticyclonic systemanticyclonic tornadoes often occur while tornadoes vortices are low-pressure regions this occurs because tornadoes occur on a small enough scale such that the coriolis effect is negligible
