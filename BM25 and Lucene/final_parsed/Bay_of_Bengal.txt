and meghna other rivers such as the irrawaddy river godavari mahanadi krishna and kaveri flow into the bay of bengal among the important ports are chennai kolkata paradip port port blair tuticorin visakhapatnam krishnapatnam port chittagong colombo yangon among the smaller ports are the dhamra port kakinada port gopalpur port and monglathe international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the bay of bengal as followsthe bay gets its name from the historical bengal region the indian state of west bengal and modern-day bangladesh in ancient scriptures this water body may have been referred to as mahodadhi sanskrit  lit great water receptacle while it appears as sinus gangeticus or gangeticus sinus meaning gulf of the ganges in ancient mapsthe other sanskrit names for bay of bengal are vangopasagara sanskrit  lit bengals bay also simply called as vangasagara sanskrit  lit bengal sea and purvapayodhi sanskrit  lit eastern ocean even today in bengali it is known as bongoposagormany major rivers of india flow west to east before draining into the bay of bengal the ganga is the northernmost of these its main channel enters and flows through bangladesh where it is known as the padma river before joining the meghna river however the brahmaputra river flows from east to west in assam before turning south and entering bangladesh where it is called the jamuna river this joins the padma where upon the padma joins the meghna river that finally drains into bay of bengal the sundarbans mangrove of forest of bangladesh is a forest at the delta of the padma jamuna and meghna rivers lies partly in west bengal and mostly in bangladesh the brahmaputra at 2,948km 1,832mi is the 28th longest river in the world it originates in tibet the hooghly river another channel of the ganga that flows through calcutta drains into bay of bengalthe padmameghna-jamuna rivers deposit nearly 1000 million tons of sediment per year the sediment from these three rivers form the bengal delta and the submarine fan a vast structure that extends from bangladesh to south of the equator is up to 16.5 kilometres 10.3mi thick and contains at least 1,130 trillion tonnes of sediment which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons per annum the bay of bengal used to be deeper than the mariana trench the present deepest ocean point the fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion molyr 13.2 million tyr since the early miocene period the three rivers currently contribute nearly 8% of the total organic carbon toc deposited in the worlds oceans due to high toc accumulation in the deep sea bed of the bay of bengal the area is rich in oil and natural gas and gas hydrate reserves bangladesh can reclaim land substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea dikes bunds causeways and by trapping the sediment from its riversfurther southwest of bangladesh the mahanadi godavari krishna and kaveri rivers also flow from west to east in south asia and drain into the bay of bengal many small rivers also drain directly into the bay of bengal the shortest of them is the cooum river at 64km 40mithe irrawaddy or ayeyarwady river in myanmar flows into the andaman sea of the bay of bengal and once had thick mangrove forests of its ownindian ports on the bay include kolkata port haldia port chennai visakhapatnam kakinada pondicherry dhamra gopalpur and bangladeshi ports on the bay are chittagong mongla payra portthe islands in the bay are numerous including the andaman islands nicobar and mergui groups of india the cheduba group of islands in the north-east off the burmese coast are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes which are occasionally active great andaman is the main archipelago or island group of the andaman islands whereas ritchies archipelago consists of smaller islands only 37 or 6.5% of the 572 islands and islets of the andaman and nicobar islands are inhabitedthe lithosphere of the earth is broken up into what are called tectonic plates underneath the bay of bengal which is part of the great indo-australian plate and is slowly moving north east this plate meets the burma microplate at the sunda trench the nicobar islands and the andaman islands are part of the burma microplate the india plate subducts beneath the burma plate at the sunda trench or java trench here the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the volcanoes in myanmar and a volcanic arc called the sunda arc the sumatra-andaman earthquake and asian tsunami was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a submarine earthquake which then resulted in a destructive tsunamia zone 50 m wide extending from the island of ceylon and the coromandel coast to the head of the bay and thence southwards through a strip embracing the andaman and nicobar islands is bounded by the 100 fathom line of sea bottom some 50 m beyond this lies the 500-fathom limit opposite the mouth of the ganges however the intervals between these depths are very much extended by deltaic influenceswatch of no ground is a 14km-wide deep sea canyon of the bay of bengal the deepest recorded area of this valley is about 1340 m the submarine canyon is part of the bengal fan the largest submarine fan in the worldthe bay of

garnet and other precious gems are also found in abundance in the indian states of odisha and andhra pradeshfrom january to october the current is northward flowing and the clockwise circulation pattern is called the east indian current the bay of bengal monsoon moves in a northwest direction striking the nicobar islands and the andaman islands first end of may then the north eastern coast of india by end of junethe remainder of the year the counterclockwise current is southwestward flowing and the circulation pattern is called the east indian winter jet september and december see very active weather season varsha or monsoon in the bay of bengal producing severe cyclones which affect eastern india several efforts have been initiated to cope with storm surgea tropical storm with rotating winds blowing at speeds of 74 miles 119 kilometres per hour is called a cyclone when they originate over the bay of bengal and called a hurricane in the atlantic between 100,000 and 500,000 residents of bangladesh were killed because of the 1970 bhola cyclonethe bay of bengal in the stretch of swargadwar the gateway to heaven in sanskrit in the indian town of puri is considered holy by

ventures along the bay of bengal was the company of merchants of london trading into the east indies more commonly referred to as the british east india company gopalpur-on-sea was one of their main trading centers other trading companies along the bay of bengal shorelines were the english east india company and the french east india companybimstec bay of bengal initiative for multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation bimstec supports free trade internationally around the bay of bengal between bangladesh bhutan india myanmar nepal sri lanka and thailandthe sethusamudram shipping canal project is a new venture proposed which would create a channel for a shipping route to link the gulf of mannar with the bay of bengal this would connect india from east to west without the necessity of going around sri lankathoni and catamaran fishing boats of fishing villages thrive along the bay of bengal shorelines fishermen can catch between 26 and 44 species of marine fish in one year the average catch is two million tons of fish from the bay of bengal alone approximately 31% of the worlds coastal fishermen live and work on the baythe bay of bengal is centrally located in south and southeast asia it lies at the center of two huge economic blocks the saarc and asean it influences chinas southern landlocked region in the north and major sea ports of india and bangladesh china india and bangladesh have forged naval cooperation agreements with malaysia thailand and indonesia to increase cooperation in checking terrorism in the high seasits outlying islands the andaman and nicobar islands and most importantly major ports such as kolkata chennai visakhapatnam tuticorin chittagong and mongla along its coast with the bay of bengal added to its importancechina has recently made efforts to project influence into the region through tie-ups with myanmar and bangladesh the united states has held major exercises with bangladesh malaysia singapore thailand and recently india the largest ever wargame in bay of bengal known as malabar 2007 was held in 2007 and naval warships from us bangladesh thailand singapore japan and australia took part india was a participantlarge deposits of natural gas in the areas within bangladeshs sea zone incited a serious urgency by india and myanmar into a territorial dispute disputes over rights of some oil and gas blocks have caused brief diplomatic spats between myanmar and india with bangladeshthe disputed maritime boundary between bangladesh and myanmar resulted in military tensions in 2008 and 2009 bangladesh is pursuing a settlement with myanmar and india to the boundary dispute through the international tribunal on the law of the seathe asian brown cloud a layer of air pollution that covers much of south asia and the indian ocean every year between january and march and possibly also during earlier and later months hangs over the bay of bengal it is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust smoke from cooking fires and industrial dischargesa transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem andor its impact is separated by a national boundary or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit the eight bay of bengal countries have 2012 identified three major transboundary problems or areas of concern affecting the health of the bay that they can work on together with the support of the bay of bengal large marine ecosystem project boblme the eight countries are now 2012 developing responses to these issues and their causes for future implementation as the strategic action programmefisheries production in the bay of bengal is six million tonnes per year more than seven percent of the worlds catch the major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are a decline in the overall availability of fish resources changes in species composition of catches the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch and changes in marine biodiversity especially through loss of vulnerable and endangered species the transboundary nature of these issues are that many fish stocks are shared between boblme countries through the transboundary migration of fish or larvae fishing overlaps national jurisdictions both legally and illegally overcapacity and overfishing in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations all countries to a greater or lesser degree are experiencing difficulties in implementing fisheries management especially the ecosystem approach to fisheries bay of bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of vulnerable and endangered speciesthe main causes of the issues are open access to fishing grounds government emphasis on increasing fish catches inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers increasing fishing effort especially from trawlers and purse seiners high consumer demand for fish including for seed and fishmeal for aquaculture ineffective fisheries management and illegal and destructive fishingthe bay of bengal is an area of high biodiversity with many endangered and vulnerable species the major transboundary issues relating to habitats are the loss and degradation of mangrove habitats degradation of coral reefs and the loss of and damage to seagrasses the transboundary nature of these major issues are that all three critical habitats occur in all boblme countries coastal development for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all boblme countries trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature climate change impacts are shared by all boblme countries the main causes of the issues are food security needs of the coastal poor lack of coastal development plans increasing trade in products from coastal habitats coastal development and industrialization ineffective marine protected areas and lack of enforcement upstream development that affects water-flow intensive upstream agricultural practices and increasing tourismthe major transboundary issues relating to pollution and water quality are sewage-borne pathogens and organic load solid wastemarine litter increasing nutrient inputs oil pollution persistent organic pollutants pops and persistent toxic substances ptss sedimentation and heavy metals the transboundary nature of these issues are discharge of untreatedpartially treated sewage being a common problem sewage and organic discharges from the ganges-brahmaputra-meghna river are likely to be transboundary plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries high nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries tar balls are transported long distances popsptss and mercury including organo-mercury undergo long-range transport sedimentation and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension the main causes of the issues are increasing coastal population density and urbanization higher consumption resulting in more waste generated per person insufficient funds allocated to waste management migration of industry into boblme countries and proliferation of small industriesnorthern circars occupied the western coast of the bay of bengal and is now considered to be indias madras state chola dynasty 9th century to 12th century when ruled by rajaraja chola i occupied the western coastline of the
