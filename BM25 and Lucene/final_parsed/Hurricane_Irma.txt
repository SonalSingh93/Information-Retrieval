hurricane irma  wikipedia hurricane irma was an extremely powerful and catastrophic cape verde-type hurricane the strongest observed in the atlantic since wilma in 2005 in terms of maximum sustained winds it was the first category5 hurricane to strike the leeward islands on record and the costliest caribbean hurricane until hurricane maria only two weeks later it was also the most intense atlantic hurricane to strike the united states since katrina in 2005 and the first major hurricane to make landfall in florida since wilma in 2005 the ninth named storm fourth hurricane second major hurricane and first category5 hurricane of the 2017 atlantic hurricane season irma caused widespread and catastrophic damage throughout its long lifetime particularly in parts of the northeastern caribbean and the florida keysirma developed on august 30 2017 near the cape verde islands from a tropical wave that had moved off the west african coast three days prior under favorable conditions irma rapidly intensified shortly after formation becoming a category2 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale within a mere 24hours irma became a category3 hurricane and therefore a major hurricane shortly afterward however the intensity fluctuated between categories2 and 3 for the next several days due to a series of eyewall replacement cycles on september 4 irma resumed intensifying becoming a category5 hurricane by early the next day on september 6 irma reached its peak intensity with 185mph 295kmh winds and a minimum pressure of 914hpa 27.0inhg making it the second most intense tropical cyclone worldwide so far in 2017 behind only hurricane maria and the strongest worldwide in 2017 in terms of wind speed another eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken back to a category4 hurricane but the storm attained category5 status for a second time before making landfall in cuba after dropping to category3 intensity due to land interaction the storm re-intensified to category4 status as it crossed warm waters between cuba and florida before making landfall on cudjoe key with maximum sustained winds at 130mph 215kmh irma dropped back to category3 by the time it made a second florida landfall on marco island irma weakened to a category2 hurricane later that day the first time it weakened below major hurricane status in over a week and eventually dissipated off the coast of new england on september 16the storm caused catastrophic damage in barbuda saint barthlemy saint martin anguilla and the virgin islands as a category5 hurricane as of october 10 the hurricane has

dutch side of sint maarten 90 in the contiguous united states four in the us virgin islands and two others in unknown locations in the caribbeanthe national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa on august 26 this wave moved off the coast of the continent late on august 27 throughout the next two days showers and thunderstorms associated with the wave became better organized and gradually coalesced into a low pressure area as the system passed just south of and then through the cape verde islands on august 29 with the nhc stating that any significant organization of the disturbance would result in the classification of a tropical depression further organization over the next 24 hours or so led to classification of the disturbance as tropical storm irma at 15:00utc on august 30 based on scatterometer data and satellite estimates with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear strengthening was anticipated with the only hindrance being slightly cooler waters and drier airthe nascent storm began developing upper-level poleward outflow as an anticyclone became established over the system with banding features becoming increasingly evident in satellite images early on august 31 shortly after the development of a central dense overcast cdo and an eye feature irma rapidly intensified beginning at 09:00utc on august 31 with winds increasing from 70mph 110kmh to 115mph 185kmh in only 12 hours on september 2 a ship passed 60mi 90km to the west of the center of irma recording maximum winds of 45mph 70kmh which indicated that the eye of irma remained compact a strengthening subtropical ridge over the central north atlantic pushed irma from a western to southwestern direction on september 2 and 3 the first aircraft reconnaissance mission departed from barbados on the afternoon of september 3 discovering an eye 29mi 47km in diameter and surface winds of 115mph 185kmhon september 4 after moving into more favorable conditions irma strengthened into a category4 hurricane as it continued approaching the leeward islands irma underwent a second and more robust period of rapid intensification becoming a category5 hurricane by 11:45utc on the following day with winds of 175mph 280kmh as it began to take on annular characteristics the extremely powerful hurricane continued to intensify with maximum sustained winds peaking at 185mph 295kmh near 00:00utc on september 6  which would remain steady and unchanged for the next 37 hours six hours later irma made landfall along the northern coast of barbuda near peak strength later that day around 21:00utc the storms pressure bottomed out at 914hpa 27.0inhg  this was the lowest in the atlantic since dean in 2007 while maintaining its intensity irma made successive landfalls at approximately 12:00utc on sint maarten and at 17:00utc on ginger island and tortola in the british virgin islandsshortly before 06:00utc on september 8 irma made landfall on the bahamian island little inagua about three hours later an eyewall replacement cycle caused irma to weaken to a category4 hurricane but the storm regained category5 status 18 hours later before making landfall in cuba after weakening to a category3 due to land interaction with cuba irma reintensified into a category4 hurricane while crossing over the straits of florida at 13:10utc on september 10 irma made landfall in cudjoe key florida with maximum sustained winds of 130mph 215kmh and a central pressure of 929hpa 27.4inhg later that day at 19:35utc irma made landfall in marco

12:00 utc on september 11 at 03:00utc on september 12 irma weakened to a tropical depression over the georgia-alabama border and degenerated into a post-tropical low about 24 hours later north of tupelo mississippi irmas remnants continued moving towards the northwest over the next day before turning northward and then accelerating to the northeast on september 14 early on september 15 irmas remnants began moving off the new england coastline becoming increasingly disorganized while continuing to weaken later on the same day irmas remnants began interacting with a cold front stretching over newfoundland on september 16 irmas remnant circulation collapsed and the majority of irmas remnant moisture was absorbed into hurricane jose later that daydata collected by nasa showed that ocean surface temperatures in the path of irma were above 30c 86f at the time more than enough to sustain a category 5 hurricane additionally ocean surface temperatures in areas along the strait of florida extended to 32c 90f which could support a maximum potential intensity of 200 miles per hour 320kmh if ideal conditions had been metgiven that irmas forecast track was along much of the caribbean

floridians had evacuated making it the largest evacuation in the states history evacuees caused significant traffic congestion on northbound interstate 95 interstate 75 and floridas turnpike exacerbated by the fact that the entire florida peninsula was within the cone of uncertainty in the national hurricane centers forecast path in the days before the storm so evacuees from both coasts headed north as evacuees would not be safer by fleeing to the opposite coast fuel was in short supply throughout peninsular florida during the week before irmas arrival especially along evacuation routes leading to hours-long lines at fuel stations and even escorts of fuel trucks by the florida highway patrol use of the left shoulder as a lane for moving traffic was allowed on northbound

prompting the trump administration to request an immediate 8billion in additional funding as irma approached florida given the rate that current funds are being consumed and the catastrophic damage the united states senate almost doubled the requested amount to 15.3billion with the understanding that this would only be about 10% of what will be required for responding to harveyhurricane irmas path was such that its impact was both far-reaching and devastating with confirmed landfalls in antigua and barbuda saint martin anguilla turks and caicos the bahamas cuba and the united states furthermore the size of the storm system meant that destruction was prevalent even in territories well removed from landfall occurrencesthe eyewall of the hurricane moved over barbuda near its record peak intensity during the night of september 56 a local anemometer reportedly measured an unofficial gust of 155mph 250kmh before being blown away though some reports of structural damage such as blown off roofs surfaced shortly after the exact state of the island remained unclear for hours after irmas passage as downed phone lines ceased all communication with nearby islands later that afternoon prime minister gaston browne surveyed the territory by helicopter revealing an effectively uninhabitable island irma damaged or destroyed 95% of the structures on barbuda including its hospital schools and both of its hotels it completely flattened some residential blocks while submerging others the destruction rendered the islands sole airport and much of its infrastructure inoperativeincluding water and telecommunication serviceswhich further hampered relief efforts preliminary assessments on barbuda suggest property damage of at least 150million a total of three storm-related deaths have been reported on the islandin addition to the catastrophic impact on barbudas human residents concern turned to the storms effects on the islands wildlife the islands only endemic bird the near-threatened barbuda warbler numbered less than 2,000 individuals prior to the hurricane it is unknown if the warbler survived the hurricane or its aftermath barbudas codrington

were treated for minor storm-related injuries forensic disaster analysts from the center for disaster management and risk reduction technology cedim a germany-based risk management agency estimate that economic losses for antigua and barbuda will exceed 120millionon the morning of september 6 irmas center crossed the island of saint martin while the storm was near peak intensity sweeping away entire structures submerging roads and cars and triggering an island-wide blackout irmas extreme winds ripped trees out of the ground and sent vehicles and debris from damaged structures scattered across the territory on the french side of saint-martin entire marinas around marigot were left in ruins littered with the stranded remnants of boats that had smashed into each other a hotel caught on fire but dangerous conditions and impassable roads prevented firefighters from putting out the blaze another hotel lost nearly all of its ground floor media images depicted devastated room interiors with furniture hurled around after the winds had shattered their windows irma killed four people on the french side of the island and injured 50 others one of whom was in critical condition as many as 95% of the buildings there were damaged to some degree 60% of those were totally uninhabitable estimates from cedim indicate a minimum of 950million worth of economic losses total loses exceeded 3.5billion 4.07billion usd
a similar situation unfolded in sint maarten saint martins dutch half as intense winds ripped through buildings and lifted vehicles aloft as if they were matches the hurricane wreaked havoc on princess juliana international airport with huge chunks of the building strewn across the runway and a jet bridge snapped in half it demolished or severely damaged about 70% of sint maartens houses forcing thousands of residents into public shelters there were two deaths and 23 injuries 11 of which were serious in the dutch territory irma is considered the worst natural disaster to hit sint maarten the extent of its damage far exceeded that of any previous hurricane prime minister william marlin estimates that at least 1billion 1.2billion will be necessary to restore the destruction while disaster analysts from cedim predict losses will exceed 1.5billion by september 9 2017 the death count rose to 4 with one death due to natural causesirma left widespread destruction and disastrous flooding along its path over the french island of saint barthlemy southeast of saint martin describing the extent of the destruction one local compared it to a bomb that burned all vegetation while another said that it were as if the hurricane had effectively erased the island from the map violent seas swept away entire coastal establishments with one hotel being stripped of all but its foundation streets in the capital of gustavia were turned into rushing rivers which carried away vehicles and pieces of furniture the islands fire station was inundated with up to 6.4ft 2.0m of flood waters with scores of homes and much of the infrastructure destroyed the majority of the islands population was left stranded and without water electricity or phone service the associated economic losses could exceed 480million according to cedims analystspreliminary assessments from the french government indicate that hurricane irma caused a combined 1.2billion 1.44billion in insured losses across the french territories of saint-martin and saint barts this total covered private property such as homes vehicles and businesses including lost revenue the extent of the damage to

anguilla had the eye of the storm pass over it on september 6 many homes and schools were destroyed and the islands only hospital was badly damaged the devastation was particularly severe in east end where the winds uprooted scores of trees and power poles and demolished a number of houses in the valley the islands capital the hurricane blew out the windows of government buildings rough seas inflicted heavy damage upon several bays and harbors and a seaside restaurant was completely eradicated about 90% of roads were left impassable the islands air traffic control tower was damaged exacerbating the already poor communication with the island one death was reported on the island according to cedim anguillas economy could suffer at least 190million in losses from the hurricanelarge swells ahead of irma washed ashore debris and sea life in castries saint lucia blocking some roads seaside roads were inundated with water one surfer was killed amid rough surf in barbados after hitting a reef and breaking his neck trees were also destroyed the hurricanes effects such as violent seas and rattling trees were intense enough to be detected by seismographs in guadeloupe several houses were damaged around 8,000 households and a water supply network on that island lost power during the storm leaving several communes in the dark without running water overall damage was limited to external parts of houses and trees that were blown onto roads and three unmanned ships wrecked by rough seassaint kitts and nevis endured similar conditions to other islands blustery rainstorms triggered scattered power outages and disabled the islands water system but per the international red cross the islands were spared the level of destruction seen elsewhere still prime minister timothy harris stated that property and infrastructure had sustained significant damage the dutch territories of saba and sint eustatius were also struck by the hurricanes winds resulting in infrastructural damage water shortages and telecommunication outages several houses were left uninhabitable on saba the hurricane also defoliated trees and injured a few people cedims analysts expect economic losses of 2065million for the two islandsdamage in the british virgin islands was extensive numerous buildings and roads were destroyed on the island of tortola which bore the brunt of the hurricanes core
