roads in hawaiiin 1755 the virginia general assembly recorded the name hampton roads as the channel linking the james elizabeth and nansemond rivers with the chesapeake bayhampton roads has become known as the worlds largest natural harbor in part because it is the northernmost major east coast port of the united states which is ice-free year round this status is claimed with the notable exception of the extraordinarily cold winter of 1917 which was the entire uss coldest year on recordover time the entire region has come to be known as hampton roads a label more specific than its

landed at cape henry todays city of virginia beach an event now called the first landing however his party moved on in search of a more defensible area upriver mindful of competitors such as the spanish who had built a failed settlement on the virginia peninsula known as the ajacn missionafter exploring the james river they established the first successful english colony in the new world on jamestown island on may 14 1607 but the low marshy site proved unhealthy and most of the colonists died before a new governor lord de la warr delaware arrived with john rolfe who would establish the virginia tobacco industrythe harbor and rivers of hampton roads were immediately recognised as prime locations for commerce shipbuilding and military installations with the fortifications at old point comfort established as early as 1610 and gosport navy yard later norfolk naval shipyard in 1767 the decisive battle of the revolution was won at yorktown in 1781 and the first naval action of the war of 1812 took place in hampton roads when a royal naval vessel was seized by the american privateer dash later the entrance from chesapeake bay was equipped with new fortifications fort monroe and fort wool much of the building work being supervised by a young military engineer robert e leeduring the american civil war 18611865 the historic battle of hampton roads between the first american ironclad warships the ussmonitor and the css virginia took place off sewells point in 1862 the battle was inconclusive but union forces later took control of hampton roads norfolk and the lower james river though they were thwarted from venturing further upstream by a strong confederate battery at drewrys bluff also in 1862 fort monroe was the launching place for union general george mcclellans massive advance up the virginia peninsula which almost reached the confederate capital richmond before the seven days battles forced him back in 1865 as the confederacy was near collapse president abraham lincoln met with three senior confederates at hampton roads in an unsuccessful bid for a negotiated peacesome former slaves had been camped near fort monroe where they were declared to be contraband of war instead of being returned to their former owners booker t washington was among the freedmen who attended the local school which evolved into the present-day hampton universitythe jamestown exposition for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 founding of jamestown was held at sewells point in a rural section of norfolk county in 1907president theodore roosevelt arrived by water in the harbor of hampton roads as did other notable persons such as mark twain and henry huttleston rogers who both arrived aboard the latters steam yacht kanawha a major naval display was featured and the us great white fleet made an appearance the leaders of the us navy apparently did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions as was later provedbeginning in 1917 as the united states became involved in world war i under president woodrow wilson formerly rural sewells point became the site of what grew to become the largest naval base in the world which was established by the united states navy and is now known as the naval station norfolktwice in the 20th century inhabitants mostly african american were displaced when land along the northern side of the peninsula primarily in york county west of yorktown was taken in large tracts for military use during world war i and world war ii creating the present-day us naval weapons station yorktown which includes cheatham annex and a former seabee base which became camp pearycommunities including the reservation halsteads point penniman biglers mill and magruder were all lost and absorbed into the large military basesalthough some left the area entirely many of the displaced families chose to relocate nearby to grove an unincorporated town in southeastern james city county where many generations of some of those families now reside from a population estimated at only 37 in 1895 grove had grown to an estimated 1,100 families by the end of the 20th century to its north grove actually borders the naval weapons station property and on its extreme east a portion of the us armys land at fort eustis extends across skiffes creek although there is no direct access to either baseit was the dream of an episcopal priest to save his 18th-century church building by turning williamsburg into the worlds largest living museum wlliamsburg replaced jamestown at the very end of the 17th century after a disastrous fire it was the capital of the colony and the new state of virginia from 1699 to 1780 the capital was moved to richmond in 1780 williamsburg became a sleepy small town during the civil war the battle of williamsburg was fought nearby during the peninsula campaign in the spring months of 1862 the decaying town was not located along any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881 perhaps due to the secure inland location originally known as middle plantation williamsburg missed growth and economic expansion in the 19th century the main economic engines were the college of william  mary and eastern state hospital the college of william and mary was chartered by the crown and is the only pre-independence college to have kept it in addition to the citys historic past quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century the reverend dr war goodwin of bruton parish church motive was to only to save historic church building which was secured by 1907 he subsequently served in rochester new york for many years upon returning to williamsburg in 1923 he realized that many of the other colonial-era buildings were deteriorating and their existence was at riskgoodwin dreamt of a much larger restoration of the colonial town a cleric of modest means he first sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully drawing the interests before receiving major financial support from standard oil heir and philanthropist john d rockefeller jr and his wife abby aldrich rockefeller the result is the creation of colonial williamsburg with extensive restoration of buildings such as the wren building of the college of william  mary and the governors palace and the transformation of downtown williamsburg area into historic district of restored buildings many 19th century buildings were removedby the 1930s colonial williamsburg had become the centerpiece of the historic triangle of colonial virginia these were of course jamestown where the colony started williamsburg and yorktown where independence from great britain was won the three points were joined by the us national park services colonial parkway a remarkable accomplishment in course of 27 years the historic triangle area of the hampton roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions in the entire worldin dr goodwins words williamsburg is jamestown continued and yorktown is williamsburg vindicatedamericas first free public schools the syms and eaton free schools later combined as syms-eaton academy were established in hampton in 1634 and 1659 respectively the syms-eaton academy was later renamed hampton academy and in 1852 became part of the public school system thus hampton high school lays claim to being the oldest public school in the united states the trust fund created from the syms and eaton donations has remained intact since the 17th century and was incorporated into support for the hampton public school systemin 1957 the hampton roads bridgetunnel was the first bridgetunnel complex in the world to be followed by the areas much longer chesapeake bay bridgetunnel in 1963 this was followed by the monitormerrimac memorial bridgetunnel in 1992 the prevalence of bridgetunnels in the area is due to the number of shipbuilding and naval bases in the area access to the open ocean from norfolk naval shipyard in portsmouth naval station norfolk joint expeditionary base little creek  fort story and newport news shipbuilding where all us nuclear aircraft carriers have been

land-based commerce and travel yet the community leaders learned to overcome themin modern times the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it has become largely urbanized with additional traffic needs in the 21st century the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based travel continue to present the areas leaders with extraordinary transportation challenges both for additional capacity and as the existing infrastructure much of it originally built with toll revenues has aged without an adequate source of funding to repair or build replacements the now-closed kings highway bridge in suffolk and the jordan bridge closed by neighboring chesapeake in 2008 were each built in the 1920s these were considered locally prime examples of this situationin 2007 the new hampton roads transportation authority hrta was formed under a controversial state law to levy various additional taxes to generate funding for major regional transportation projects including a long-sought and costly additional crossing of the harbor of hampton roads the hampton roads bridge tunnel monitor-merrimac bridge tunnel and the james river bridge are the existing
