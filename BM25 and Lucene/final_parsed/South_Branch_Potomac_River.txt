potomac river  wikipedia the potomac river  is located along the mid-atlantic ocean coast of the united states and flows into the chesapeake bay the river main stem and north branch is approximately 405 miles 652km long with a drainage area of about 14,700 square miles 38,000km in terms of area this makes the potomac river the fourth largest river along the atlantic coast of the united states and the 21st largest in the united states over 5 million people live within the potomac watershedthe river forms part of the borders between maryland and washington dc on the left descending bank and west virginia and virginia on the rivers right descending bank the majority of the lower potomac river is part of the state of maryland exceptions include a small tidal portion within the district of columbia and the border with virginia being delineated from point to point thus various bays and shoreline indentations lie in virginia except for a small portion of its headwaters in west virginia the north branch potomac river is considered part of maryland to the low water mark on the opposite bank the south branch potomac river lies completely within the state of west virginia except for its headwaters which lie in virginiathe potomac river runs 405 miles 652km from the fairfax stone in west virginia on the allegheny plateau to point lookout maryland and drains 14,679 square miles 38,020km the length of the river from the junction of its north and south branches to point lookout is 302 miles 486km the average flow is 10,800 fts 306 ms the largest flow ever recorded on the potomac at washington dc was in march 1936 when it reached 425,000fts 12,000 ms the lowest flow ever recorded at the same location was 600fts 17 ms in september 1966the river has two sources the source of the north branch is at the fairfax stone located at the junction of grant tucker and preston counties in west virginia the source of the south branch is located near hightown in northern highland county virginia the rivers two branches converge just east of green spring in hampshire county west virginia to form the potomaconce the potomac drops from the piedmont to the coastal plain at little falls tides further influence the river as it passes through washington dc and beyond salinity in the potomac river estuary increases thereafter with distance downstream the estuary also widens reaching 11 statute miles 17km wide at its mouth between point lookout maryland and smith point virginia before flowing into the chesapeake baypotomac is a european spelling of patowmeck the algonquian name of a native american village perhaps meaning something brought native americans had different names for different parts of the river calling the river above great falls cohongarooton meaning honking geese and patawomke below the fall meaning river of swans the spelling of the name has taken many forms over the years from patawomeke as on captain john smiths map to patawomeck patowmack and numerous other spellings in the 18th century and now potomac the rivers name was officially decided upon as potomac by the board on geographic names in 1931the river itself is at least two million years old likely extending back ten to twenty million years before present when the atlantic ocean lowered and exposed coastal sediments along the fall line this included the area at great falls which eroded into its present form during recent glaciation periodsthe potomac river brings together a variety of cultures throughout the watershed from the coal miners of upstream west virginia to the urban residents of the nations capital and along the lower potomac the watermen of virginias northern neckbeing situated in an area rich in american history and american heritage has led to the potomac being nicknamed the nations river george washington the first president of the united states was born in surveyed and spent most of his life within the potomac basin all of washington dc the nations capital city also lies within the watershed the 1859 siege of harpers ferry at the rivers confluence with the shenandoah was a precursor to numerous epic battles of the american civil war in and around the potomac and its tributaries such as the 1861 battle of balls bluff and the 1862 battle of shepherdstown general robert e lee crossed the river thereby invading the north and threatening washington dc twice in campaigns climaxing in the battles of antietam september 17 1862 and gettysburg july 13 1863 confederate general jubal early crossed the river in july 1864 on his attempted raid on the nations capital the river not only divided the union from the confederacy but also gave name to the unions largest army the army of the potomacthe patowmack canal was intended by george washington to connect the tidewater region near georgetown with cumberland maryland started in 1785 on the virginia side of the river it was not completed until 1802 financial troubles led to the closure of the canal in 1830 the chesapeake and ohio canal operated along the banks of the potomac in maryland from 1831 to 1924 and also connected cumberland to washington dc this allowed freight to be transported around the rapids known as the great falls of the potomac river as well as many other smaller rapidswashington dc began using the potomac as its principal source of drinking water with the opening of the washington aqueduct in 1864 using a water intake constructed at great fallsin march 1996 an agreement was signed which made the potomac a sister river of the ara river one of the principal rivers of tokyo president bill clinton designated the potomac as one of the american heritage rivers in 1998an average of approximately 486million us gallons 1,840,000m of water per day is withdrawn daily in the washington area for water supplyas a result of damaging floods in 1936 and 1937 the army corps of engineers proposed a series of dams that were intended to regulate the river and to provide a more reliable water supply one dam was to be built at little falls just north of washington backing its pool up to great falls just above great falls a much larger dam was proposed whose reservoir would extend to harpers ferry several other dams were proposed for the potomac and its tributaries when detailed studies were issued by the corps in the 1950s they met sustained opposition led by us supreme court justice william o douglas resulting in the plans abandonment the only dam project that did get built was jennings randolph lake on the north branch the corps built a supplementary water intake for the washington aqueduct at little falls in 1959in 1940 congress passed a law authorizing creation of an interstate compact to coordinate water quality management among states in the potomac basin maryland west virginia pennsylvania virginia and the district of columbia agreed to establish the interstate commission on the potomac river basin the compact was amended in 1970 to include coordination of water supply issues and land use issues related to water qualitybeginning in the 19th century with increasing mining and agriculture upstream and urban sewage and runoff downstream the water quality of the potomac river deteriorated this created conditions of severe eutrophication it is said that president abraham lincoln used to escape to the highlands on summer nights to escape the rivers stench in the 1960s with dense green algal blooms covering the rivers surface president lyndon johnson declared the river a national disgrace and set in motion a long-term effort to reduce pollution from sewage and restore the beauty and ecology of this historic river one of significant pollution control projects at the time was the expansion of the blue plains advanced wastewater treatment plant which serves washington and several surrounding communities enactment of the 1972 clean water act led to construction or expansion of additional sewage treatment plants in the potomac watershed controls on phosphorus one of the principal contributors to eutrophication were implemented in the 1980s through sewage plant upgrades and restrictions on phosphorus in detergentsby the end of the 20th century there was notable success as massive algal blooms vanished and recreational fishing and boating rebounded still the aquatic habitat of the potomac river and its tributaries remain vulnerable to eutrophication heavy metals pesticides and other toxic chemicals over-fishing alien species and pathogens associated with fecal coliform bacteria and shellfish diseases in 2005 two federal agencies the us geological survey and the fish and wildlife service began to identify fish in the potomac and tributaries that exhibited intersex characteristics as a result of endocrine disruption caused by some form of pollution on november 13 2007 the potomac conservancy an environmental group issued the river a grade of d-plus citing high levels of pollution and the reports of intersex fish since then the river has improved with a reduction in nutrient runoff return of fish populations and land protection along the river as a result the same group issued a grade of b-minus in 2016 for 400 years maryland and virginia have disputed control of the potomac and its north branch since both states original colonial charters grant the entire river rather than half of it as is normally the case with boundary rivers in its first state constitution adopted in 1776 virginia ceded its claim to the entire river but reserved free use of it an act disputed by maryland both states acceded to the compact of 1785 and the 1877 black-jenkins award which grants maryland the river bank-to-bank from the low water mark on the virginia side while permitting virginia full riparian rights short of obstructing navigationfrom 1957 to 1996 the maryland department of the environment mde routinely issued permits applied for by virginia entities concerning use of the potomac however in 1996 the mde denied a permit submitted by the fairfax county water authority to build a water intake 725 feet 220 m offshore citing potential harm to marylands interests by an increase in virginia sprawl caused by the project after years of failed appeals within the maryland governments appeal processes in 2000 virginia took the case to the supreme court of the united states which exercises original jurisdiction in cases between two states maryland claimed virginia lost its riparian rights by acquiescing to mdes permit process for 63 years mde began its permit process in 1933 a special master appointed by the supreme court to investigate recommended the case be settled in favor of virginia citing the language in the 1785 compact and the 1877 award on december 9 2003 the court agreed in a 7-2 decisionthe original charters are silent as to which branch from the upper potomac serves as the boundary but this was settled by the 1785 compact when west virginia seceded from virginia in 1863 the question of west virginias succession in title to the lands between the branches of the river was raised as well as title to the river itself claims by maryland to west virginia land north of the south branch all of mineral and grant counties and parts of hampshire hardy tucker and pendleton counties and by west virginia to the potomacs high-water mark were rejected by the supreme court in two separate decisions in 1910the source of the north branch potomac river is at the fairfax stone located at the junction of grant tucker and preston counties in west virginiafrom the fairfax stone the north branch potomac river flows 27 miles 43km to the man-made jennings randolph lake an impoundment designed for flood control and emergency water supply below the dam the north branch cuts a serpentine path through the eastern allegheny mountains first it flows northeast by the communities of bloomington luke and westernport in maryland and then on by keyser west virginia to cumberland maryland at cumberland the river turns southeast 103 miles 166km downstream from its source the north branch is joined by the south branch between green spring and south branch depot west virginia from whence it flows past hancock maryland and turns southeast once more on its way toward washington dc and the chesapeake baythe following are major tributaries of the north branch potomac river listed in order from the source to its mouth numerous other tributary creeks existthe south branch potomac river has its headwaters in northwestern highland county virginia near hightown along the eastern edge of the allegheny front after a river distance of 139 miles 224km the mouth of the south branch lies east of green spring in hampshire county west virginia where it meets the north branch potomac river to form the potomacthe native americans of the region and thus the earliest white settlers referred to the south branch potomac river as the wappatomaka variants throughout the rivers history included wappatomica river wapacomo river wapocomo river wappacoma river wappatomaka river south branch of potowmac river and south fork potomac riverplaces settled in the south branch valley bearing variants of wappatomaka include wappocomo farm built in 1774 and the unincorporated hamlet of wappocomo sometimes spelled wapocomo at hanging rocks both north of romney on west virginia route 28the exact location of the south branchs source is northwest of hightown along us route 250 on the eastern side of lantz mountain 3,934ft in highland county from hightown the south branch is a small meandering stream that flows northeast along blue grass valley road through the communities of new hampden and blue grass at forks of waters the south branch joins with strait creek and flows north across the virginiawest virginia border into pendleton county the river then travels on a northeastern course along the western side of jack mountain 4,045ft followed by sandy ridge 2,297ft along us route 220 north of the confluence of the south branch with smith creek the river flows along town mountain 2,848ft around franklin at the junction of us route 220 and us route 33 after franklin the south branch continues north through the monongahela national forest to upper tract where it joins with three sizeable streams reeds creek mill run and deer run between big mountain 2,582ft and cave mountain 2,821ft the south branch bends around the eagle rock 1,483ft outcrop and continues its flow northward into grant county into grant the south branch follows the western side of cave mountain through the 20-mile 32km long smoke hole canyon until its confluence with the north fork at cabins where it flows east to petersburg at petersburg the south branch is joined with the south branch valley railroad which it parallels until its mouth at green springin its eastern course from petersburg into hardy county the south branch becomes more navigable allowing for canoes and smaller river vessels the river splits and forms a series of large islands while it heads northeast to moorefield at moorefield the south branch is joined by the south fork south branch potomac river and runs north to old fields where it is fed by anderson run and stony run at mcneill the south branch flows into the trough where it is bound to its west by mill creek mountain 2,119ft and to its east by sawmill ridge 1,644ft this area is the habitat to bald eagles the trough passes into hampshire county and ends at its confluence with sawmill run south of glebe and sector the south branch continues north parallel to south branch river road county route 8 toward romney with a number of historic plantation farms adjoining it en route to romney the river is fed by buffalo run mill run mcdowell run and mill creek at vanderlip the south branch is traversed by the northwestern turnpike us route 50 and joined by sulphur spring run where it forms valley view island to the west of town flowing north of romney the river still follows the eastern side of mill creek mountain until it creates a horseshoe bend at wappocomos hanging rocks around the george w washington plantation ridgedale to the west of three churches on the western side of south branch mountain 3,028 feet 923 m the south branch creates a series of bends and flows to the northeast by springfield through blues ford after two additional horseshoe bends meanders the south branch flows under the old baltimore and ohio railroad mainline between green spring and south branch depot and joins the north branch to form the potomacclick-here for a watershed mapthe north fork south branch potomac river 43.6 miles 70.2km long forms just north of the virginiawest virginia border in pendleton county at the confluence of the laurel fork and straight fork along big mountain 3,881 feet 1,183m from circleville the north fork flows northeast through pendleton county between the fore knobs 2,949 feet 899m to its west and the river knobs 2,490 feet 759 m to its east at seneca rocks the north fork is met by seneca creek from seneca rocks the north fork continues to flow northeast along the western edge of north fork mountain 3,389 feet 1033 m into grant county flowing east through north fork gap the north fork joins the south branch potomac at the town of cabins west of petersburgthe south fork south branch potomac river forms just north of us route 250 in highland county virginia near head waters and flows 68.4 miles 110.1km north-northeastward to the south branch potomac river at moorefield in hardy county west virginia from 1896 to 1929 it was named the moorefield river by the board on geographic names to avoid confusion with the south branchthis stretch encompasses the stretch of the potomac river from the confluence of the north and south branches to the beginning of tidewater just below the little falls branch in washington dcthe tidal or lower potomac river lies below the fall line this stretch encompasses the potomac from about one mile 2km below the washington dc - montgomery county line just below the little falls of the potomac river where the tidal river begins to chesapeake baya variety of fish inhabit the potomac including bass muskellunge pike walleye the northern snakehead an invasive species resembling the native bowfin lamprey and american eel was first seen in 2004 although rare bull sharks can be found
