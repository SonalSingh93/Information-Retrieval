miami at present-day st joseph in 1691 the french established a trading post and fort st joseph along the st joseph river at the present day city of nilesin 1701 french explorer and army officer antoine de la mothe cadillac founded fort pontchartrain du dtroit or fort pontchartrain on-the-strait on the strait known as the detroit river between lakes saint clair and erie cadillac had convinced king louis xivs chief minister louis phlypeaux comte de pontchartrain that a permanent community there would strengthen french control over the upper great lakes and discourage british aspirationsthe hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent about 0.85 acres 3,400m the equivalent of just under 200 feet 61m per side and named it fort pontchartrain cadillacs wife marie thrse guyon soon moved to detroit becoming one of the first european women to settle in the michigan wilderness the town quickly became a major fur-trading and shipping post the glise de saint-anne church of saint ann was founded the same year while the original building does not survive the congregation continues to be active today cadillac later departed to serve as the french governor of louisiana from 1710 to 1716 french attempts to consolidate the fur trade led to the fox wars involving the meskwaki fox and their allies versus the french and their native alliesat the same time the french strengthened fort michilimackinac at the straits of mackinac to better control their lucrative fur-trading empire by the mid-18th century the french also occupied forts at

home rule cities can generally do anything that is not prohibited by law the fifteen state universities have broad power and can do anything within the parameters of their status as educational

are two types of township in michigan general law township and charter charter township status was created by the legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city as of april 2001 there were 127 charter townships in michigan in general charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations for example a charter township can have its own fire department water and sewer department police department and so onjust like a citybut it is not required to have those things whereas cities must provide those services charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead such as deputies from the county sheriffs office instead of a home-based

lake erie lake huron lake michigan and lake superior it has more public golf courses registered boats and lighthouses than any other state the state is bounded on the south by the states of ohio and indiana sharing land and water boundaries with both michigans western boundaries are almost entirely water boundaries from south to north with illinois and wisconsin in lake michigan then a land boundary with wisconsin and the upper peninsula that is principally demarcated by the menominee and montreal rivers then water boundaries again in lake superior with wisconsin and minnesota to the west capped around by the canadian province of ontario to the north and eastthe heavily forested upper peninsula is relatively mountainous in the west the porcupine mountains which are part of one of the oldest mountain chains in the world rise to an altitude of almost 2,000 feet 610m above sea level and form the watershed between the streams flowing into lake superior and lake michigan the surface on either side of this range is rugged the states highest point in the huron mountains northwest of marquette is mount arvon at 1,979 feet 603m the peninsula is as large as connecticut delaware massachusetts and rhode island combined but has fewer than 330,000 inhabitants they are sometimes called yoopers from upers and their speech the yooper dialect has been heavily influenced by the numerous scandinavian and canadian immigrants who settled the area during the lumbering and mining boom of the late 19th centurythe lower peninsula is shaped like a mitten and many residents hold up a hand to depict where they are from it is 277 miles 446km long from north to south and 195 miles 314km from east to west and occupies nearly two-thirds of the states land area the surface of the peninsula is generally level broken by conical hills and glacial moraines usually not more than a few hundred feet tall it is divided by a low water divide running north and south the larger portion of the state is on the west of this and gradually slopes toward lake michigan the highest point in the lower peninsula is either briar hill at 1,705 feet 520m or one of several points nearby in the vicinity of cadillac the lowest point is the surface of lake erie at 571 feet 174mthe geographic orientation of michigans peninsulas makes for a long distance between the ends of the state ironwood in the far western upper peninsula lies 630 highway miles 1,015km from lambertville in the lower peninsulas southeastern corner the geographic isolation of the upper peninsula from michigans political and population centers makes the up culturally and economically distinct occasionally up residents have called for secession from michigan and establishment as a new state to be called superiora
