inlet broke through however this was expected the inlet widened on september 21 1938 moriches inlet and efforts by local communities east of fire island to protect their beach front with jetties have led to an interruption in the longshore drift of sand going from east to west and is blamed for erosion of the fire island beachfront between these major breaks there have been reports over the years of at least six inlets that broke through the island but have since disappearedthe origin of fire islands name is not certain it is believed its native american name was sictem hackey which translated to land of the secatogues the secatogues were a tribe in the area of the current town of islip it was part of what was also called the seal islandsthe name of fire island first appeared on a deed in 1789historian richard bayles suggested that the name derives from a misinterpretation or corruption of the dutch word vijf five or in another version vier four referring to the number of islands near the fire island inlet at times histories have referred to it in the plural as fire islands because of the inlet breaksother versions say the island derived its name from fires built on the seas edge by native americans or by pirates to lure unsuspecting ships into the sandbars some say it is how portions of the island look to be on fire from sea in autumn yet another version says it comes from the rash caused by poison ivy on the islandwhile the western portion of the island was referred to as fire island for many years the eastern portion was referred to as great south beach until 1920 when widespread development caused the whole land mass to be called fire islandwilliam tangier smith held title to the entire island in the 17th century under a royal patent from thomas dongan the remnants of smiths manor of st george are open to the public in shirley new yorka 2009 beach renourishment program was credited with saving the island from the full effects of hurricane sandy in 2012in the winter and spring of 2009 a beach renourishment project was undertaken on fire island with the cooperation of the national park service the us army corps of engineers the towns of brookhaven and islip and fire island residents the renourishment program involved dredging sand from an offshore borrow area pumping it onto the beach and shaping the sand into an approved beach face and dune template in front of the communities of corneille estates davis park dunewood fair harbor fire island pines fire island summer club lonelyville ocean bay park ocean beach saltaire and seaview fire islanders agreed to a significant property tax increase to help pay for the project which was estimated to cost between 23 and 25 million 6,020 per housing unit including the cost of environmental monitoring and was expected to add 1,400,000 cubic meters 1,800,000 cubic yards of sand in front of the participating communities the towns of brookhaven and islip in which the communities are located issued bonds to pay for the project backed by the new taxes levied by community erosion control taxing districtsthe island was heavily damaged in the high tides associated with hurricane sandy in 2012 including three breaches around smith point county park on the sparsely populated east end of the island the biggest breach and politically most difficult one to deal with because it is in a wilderness area is at old inlet in the otis pike wilderness area just west of smith point county park old inlet is at the site of previous breaches which have come and gone on their own was 108 feet wide after the storm on the south end and 1,171 feet on february 28 2013 officials have been debating whether to close the breach and let nature take its course as it has been flushing out the great south bay and improving water quality however residents of the bay front communities noted increased flooding after the storm this flooding was later found to be the result of several noreasters and unrelated to the breaches as of 2015 the breach remained open officials have moved to close the other two breaches which are on either side of moriches inletone in cupsogue county park and the other one being in smith point county parkreports indicated that 80 percent of the homes particularly those on the east end were flooded and 90 homes were completely destroyed the
