hurricane alicia  wikipedia hurricane alicia was the costliest tropical cyclone in the atlantic since hurricane agnes in 1972 alicia was the third depression the first tropical storm and the only major hurricane of the 1983 atlantic hurricane season it struck galveston and houston texas directly causing 1.7billion 1983usd in damage and killing 21 people this made it the worst texas hurricane since hurricane carla in 1961 in addition alicia was the first billion-dollar tropical cyclone in texas historyhurricane alicia was the first hurricane to hit the united states mainland since hurricane allen in august 1980 the time between the two storms totaled three years and eight days 1,103days hurricane alicia became the last major hurricane category3 or higher to strike texas until the stronger hurricane bret in 1999 made landfall alicia was the first storm for which the national hurricane center issued landfall probabilitieshurricane alicia was notable for the delayed post storm evacuation of galveston island since the eye of the storm traveled the evacuation route up interstate 45 from galveston to houston the hurricane was also notable for the shattering of many windows in downtown houston by loose gravel from the roofs of new skyscrapers and by other debris prompting changes to rooftop construction codesthe origins of hurricane alicia were from a cold front that extended from new england through the central gulf of mexico on august14 mesoscale low-pressure area developed off the alabama and mississippi coastlines around 0100utc on august15 the low had maintained convection or area of thunderstorms for 12hours as well as a circulation for sixhours as a result the national hurricane center nhc began issuing dvorak classifications on the system by a few hours later the deep convection became organized in the circulations southern semicircle which prompted a hurricane hunters flight into the system at 1200utc that day the system developed into tropical depression three about 350miles 560km south-southwest of the mississippi river delta a few hours later the hurricane hunters confirmed its development such development along the tail end of a cold front is more typical earlier or later in the hurricane seasonafter becoming a tropical cyclone the depression was moving slowly westward due to a ridge to its north a hurricane hunters flight late on august15 reported that the depression reached winds of 50mph 80kmh as a result the nhc upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm alicia at the time of its upgrade the storm was located in an area of higher than normal atmospheric pressure although conditions favored further development due to high pressures surrounding the storm alicia was a smaller than normal tropical cyclone as a result it produced stronger than normal winds in comparison to its minimum central pressure the storm continued slowly to the west-northwest and by august17 attained hurricane status about 160miles 255km southeast of galveston texas shortly thereafter an eye became visible on radar as the hurricane executed several small loops its slow movement over warm waters in addition to an anticyclone becoming established over the hurricane caused alicia to undergo rapid deepeningat 0600utc on august18 the winds reached 115mph 185kmh just before alicia made landfall about 25mi 40km southwest of galveston texas upon moving ashore the gale-force winds extended 125mi 201km from the center and hurricane-force winds spread across an area from freeport to 60mi 97km northeast its atmospheric pressure was 962mbar hpa 28.41inhg around the time of landfall and radar imagery indicated the presence of a rare double-eye structure alicia quickly weakened passing over central houston with sustained winds of 80mph 130kmh it accelerated toward the northwest weakening to tropical storm status late on august18 and to tropical depression status twelve hours later tropical depression alicia moved into oklahoma and interacted with an approaching frontal trough by 0600utc on august20 alicia had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over northwestern oklahoma and by the next day it was no longer identifiable after merging with the trough over eastern nebraskaseveral watches and warnings were issued in association with alicia the first ones were a gale warning and a hurricane watch for the area between corpus christi texas and grand isle louisiana issued on august 16 on august 17 a hurricane warning was issued for the coastline from corpus christi to morgan city louisiana and later for port arthur texas southward initially however residents did not take the warnings seriously galveston mayor e gus manuel against the advice of texas governor mark white ordered the evacuation of only low-lying areas as a result only 10 percent of the population living behind the seawall chose to leave when alicia came ashore in contrast about 30 percent of galvestons population evacuated the island when hurricane allen threatened the eastern texas coastline in 1980 throughout the day however as the increasing winds began to cause damage in galveston people grew more concerned the mayor finally ordered a widespread evacuation of the island after midnight on august 18 but by then the bridges to the mainland were uncrossablegalveston reported in 197mm of rain liberty reported in 241mm

garfunkel reunion concert scheduled for the houston astrodome was canceled due to the coming stormtwenty-three tornadoes were reported in association with alicia fourteen of those were located in the galveston and hobby airport area the other nine were concentrated around tyler to houston texas ranging around f2 on the fujita scalea major oil spill occurred around texas city and an ocean-going tugboat capsized 50 miles 80km off the sabine pass coast the coast guard air station houston airsta weathered alicia with little damage and afterwards airstas helicopters assisted residents with evacuation supply and survey flightssixty gallons of water had to be removed from the national weather service nws office in galveston this weather office also temporarily lost its radar houston suffered billions of dollars in damage thousands of glass panes in downtown skyscrapers were shattered by gravel blown off rooftops although alicia was a small category 3 hurricane a total of 2,297

that another 100million 1983 usd 240million 2017usd in damage could have occurred also if alicia had been the size of hurricane carla from 1961 damage could have easily doubled or possibly tripled

witnesses agreed that the nws did well before and during the emergency caused by alicia nws forecasters also testified in which they said they gratified themselves that their predictions were well on target and that the local emergency plans had worked so well which saved many lives mayor gus manuel on galveston claimed that the nws did an excellent job during alicia he was also very impressed about their landfall predictions on august 17 during the september 24 hearing evidence was presented which demonstrated the need for improving readiness to cope with disasters such as alicia mayor manuel mentioned that his town needed stronger building codes which were under reviewdue to the severe damage the name alicia was retired in the spring of 1984 by the world meteorological organization and will never be used again for an atlantic hurricane it was the first name to be retired since hurricane allen in 1980 it was replaced with allison for the 1989 seasonthe approach and eventual landfall of alicia is a central plot point in a season 1 episode of the amc television drama halt and catch fire
