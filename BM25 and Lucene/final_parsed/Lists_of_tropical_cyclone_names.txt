tropical cyclone naming  wikipedia tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones are named by various warning centers to provide ease of communication between forecasters and the general public regarding forecasts watches and warnings the names are intended to reduce confusion in the event of concurrent storms in the same basin generally once storms produce sustained wind speeds of more than 33 knots 61kmh 38mph names are assigned in order from predetermined lists depending on which basin they originate however standards vary from basin to basin some tropical depressions are named in the western pacific while tropical cyclones must have a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the centre before they are named in the southern hemispherebefore the formal start of naming tropical cyclones were named after places objects or saints feast days on which they occurred the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific formal naming schemes and naming lists have subsequently been introduced and developed for the eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region atlantic ocean and indian oceanbefore the formal start of naming tropical cyclones were often named after places objects or saints feast days on which they occurred the credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the queensland government meteorologist clement wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907 this system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after wragge retired until it was revived in the latter part of world war ii for the western pacific formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the north atlantic eastern central western and southern pacific basins as well as the australian region and indian oceanat present tropical cyclones are officially named by one of eleven warning centers and retain their names throughout their lifetimes to facilitate the effective communication of forecasts and storm-related hazards to the general public this is especially important when multiple storms are occurring simultaneously in the same ocean basin names are generally assigned in order from predetermined lists once they produce one three or ten-minute sustained wind speeds of more than 65kmh 40mph however standards vary from basin to basin with some systems named in the western pacific when they develop into tropical depressions or enter pagasas area of responsibility within the southern hemisphere systems must be characterized by a significant amount of gale-force winds occurring around the center before they are namedany member of the world meteorological organizations hurricane typhoon and tropical cyclone committees can request that the name of a tropical cyclone be retired or withdrawn from the various tropical cyclone naming lists a name is retired or withdrawn if a consensus or majority of members agree that the system has acquired a special notoriety such as causing a large number of deaths and amounts of damage impact or for other special reasons a replacement name is then submitted to the committee concerned and voted upon but these names can be rejected and replaced with another name for various reasons these reasons include the spelling and pronunciation of the name the similarity to the name of a recent tropical cyclone or on another list of names and the length of the name for modern communication channels such as social media pagasa also retires the names of significant tropical cyclones when they have caused at least 1billion in damage or have caused at least 300deathswithin the north atlantic ocean tropical or subtropical cyclones are named by the national hurricane center nhcrsmc miami when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storms with winds of at least 34kn 39mph 63kmh there are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the first letters aw used skipping q and u and alternating between male and female names the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organizations hurricane committee meeting if all of the names on a list are used storms are named after the letters of the greek alphabetthe current naming scheme began with the 1979 season it uses alternating womens and mens names and also includes some spanish and a few french names before then only womens names were usedwithin the eastern pacific ocean there are two warning centers that assign names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the world meteorological organization when they are judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 34kn 39mph 63kmh tropical cyclones that intensify into tropical storms between the coast of americas and 140w are named by the national hurricane center nhcrsmc miami while tropical cyclones intensifying into tropical storms between 140w and 180 are named by the central pacific hurricane center cphcrsmc honolulu significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists and a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organization hurricane committeethe current naming scheme began with the 1978 season one year before the atlantic basin and which anomalously used the list that will be used next in 2018 rather than the one for 2020 as with the atlantic basin it uses alternating womens and mens names and also includes some spanish and a few french names before then only womens names were used because eastern pacific hurricanes mainly threaten western mexico and central america the lists contain more spanish names than the atlantic listswhen a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the equator between the coastline of the americas and 140w it will be named by the nhc there are six lists of names which rotate every six years and begin with the letters az used skipping q and u with each name alternating between a male or a female name the names of significant tropical cyclones are retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next world meteorological organizations hurricane committee if all of the names on a list are used storms are named using the letters of the greek alphabetwhen a tropical depression intensifies into a tropical storm to the north of the equator between 140w and 180 it is named by the cphc four lists of hawaiian names are maintained by the world meteorological organizations hurricane committee rotating without regard to year with the first name for a new year being the next name in sequence that was not used the previous year significant tropical cyclones have their names retired from the lists with a replacement name selected at the next hurricane committee meetingtropical cyclones that occur within the northern hemisphere between the anti-meridian and 100e are officially named by the japan meteorological agency when they become tropical storms however pagasa also names tropical cyclones that occur or develop into tropical depressions within their self-defined area of responsibility between 5n25n and 115e-135e this often results in tropical cyclones in the region having two namestropical cyclones within the western pacific are assigned international names by the jma when they become a tropical storm with 10-minute sustained winds of at least 34kn 39mph 63kmh the names are used sequentially without regard to year and are taken from five lists of names that were prepared by the escapwmo typhoon committee after each of the 14 members submitted 10 names in 1998 the order of the names to be used was determined by placing the english name of the members in alphabetical order members of the committee are allowed to request the retirement or replacement of a systems name if it causes extensive destruction or for other reasons such as number of deaths unlike other basins storms are also named after plants animals objects and mythological beingssince 1963 pagasa has independently operated its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones that occur within its own self-defined philippine area of responsibility the names are taken from four different lists of 25 names and are assigned when a system moves into or develops into a tropical depression within pagasas jurisdiction the four lists of names are rotated every four years with the names of significant tropical cyclones retired should they have caused at least 1billion in damage and or at least 300deaths within the philippines should the list of names for a given year be exhausted names are taken from an auxiliary list the first ten of which are published every yearwithin the north indian ocean between 45e 100e tropical cyclones are named by the india meteorological department imdrsmc new delhi when they are judged to have intensified into a cyclonic storm with 3-minute sustained wind speeds of at least 34kn 39mph 63kmh there are eight lists of names which are used in sequence and are not rotated every few years however the names of significant tropical cyclones are retiredwithin the south-west indian ocean in the southern hemisphere between africa and 90e a tropical or subtropical disturbance is named when it is judged to have intensified into a tropical storm with winds of at least 34kn 39mph 63kmh this is defined as being when gales are either observed or estimated to be present near a significant portion of the systems center systems are named in conjunction with mto-france reunion by either mto madagascar or the mauritius meteorological service if a disturbance reaches the naming stage between africa and 55e then mto madagascar names it if it reaches the naming stage between 55e and 90e then the mauritius meteorological service names
