hurricane agnes  wikipedia hurricane agnes was at the time the costliest hurricane to hit the united states in recorded history the second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 1972 atlantic hurricane season agnes developed on june14 from the interaction of a polar front and an upper trough over the yucatn peninsula initially forming as a tropical depression the storm headed slowly eastward and emerged into the western caribbean sea on june15 once in the caribbean the depression began to strengthen and by the following day it became tropical storm agnes thereafter agnes slowly curved northward and passed just west of cuba on june17 early on june18 the storm intensified enough to be upgraded to hurricane agnes heading northward the hurricane eventually made landfall near panama city florida late on june19 after moving inland agnes rapidly weakened and was only a tropical depression when it entered georgia the weakening trend halted as the storm crossed over georgia and into south carolina while over eastern north carolina agnes re-strengthened into a tropical storm on june21 as a result of baroclinic activity early the following day the storm emerged into the atlantic ocean before re-curving northwestward and making landfall near new york city as a strong tropical storm agnes quickly became an extratropical cyclone on june23 and tracked to the northwest of great britain before becoming absorbed by another cyclone on july6though it moved slowly across the yucatn peninsula damage in mexico is unknown although the storm bypassed the tip of cuba heavy rainfall occurred killing seven people in florida agnes caused a significant tornado outbreak with at least 26confirmed twisters two of which were spawned in georgia the tornadoes and two initially unconfirmed tornadoes in florida alone resulted in over 4.5million 1972usd in damage and six fatalities at least 2,082structures in florida suffered either major damage or were destroyed about1,355 other dwellings experienced minor losses though agnes made landfall as a hurricane no hurricane-force winds were reported along the coast abnormally high tides resulted in extensive damage especially between apalachicola and cedar key light to moderate rainfall was reported in florida though no significant flooding occurred in georgia damage was limited to two tornadoes which caused approximately 275,000 in losses minimal effects were also recorded in alabama connecticut delaware rhode island south carolina and tennessee though one fatality was reported in delaware the most significant effects by far occurred in pennsylvania mostly due to intense flooding the hurricane severely flooded the susquehanna river and the lackawanna river causing major damage to the wilkes-barrescranton metropolitan area in both pennsylvania and new jersey combined about 43,594 structures were either destroyed or significantly damaged in canada a mobile home was toppled killing two people overall agnes caused 128fatalities and nearly 3billion in damage though more recently it is estimated that there were 2.1billion in losses associated with the storm due to the significant effects the name agnes was retired in the spring of 1973in early-mid june1972 atmospheric conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis in the caribbean sea banded convection developed in the northwestern caribbean sea by june11 though the system did not significantly organize after an upper trough moved east wind shear decreased causing lower atmospheric pressures observations in cozumel quintana roo mexico it is estimated that a tropical depression developed by 1200utc on june14 while centered over the yucatn peninsula about 78 miles 126km southeast of mrida yucatn the depression tracked eastward and entered the western caribbean sea on june15 operationally the national hurricane center did not initiate advisories on the depression until 1500utc on june15 early on june16 at 0000utc the depression strengthened into tropical storm agnes however the depression was not operationally upgraded until sixteen hours laterafter becoming a tropical storm on june16 agnes slowly curved northward and approached the yucatn channel late on june17 it was noted that projected path indicated the possibly of landfall in western cuba however the storm remained offshore though it closely brushed the western tip of cuba at 1200utc on june18 agnes intensified into a hurricane while in the southeastern gulf of mexico prematurely the national hurricane center operationally upgraded agnes to a hurricane at 0200utc on that day upon becoming a hurricane agnes attained its maximum sustained winds of 85mph 140kmh though it had not reached its minimum atmospheric pressure due to unfavorable conditions agnes leveled-off slightly in intensity and weakened to a minimal hurricane while approaching the gulf coast of the united states shortly before 2200utc on june19 agnes made landfall near cape san blas florida with winds of 75mph 120kmhat 0000utc on june20 only a few hours after moving inland agnes weakened to a tropical storm after crossing the floridaalabamageorgia stateline agnes rapidly weakened to a tropical depression while over georgia the depression curved northeastward and eventually to the east-northeast after entering south carolina though the storm had not dissipated the national hurricane center issued its final bulletin on agnes at 1600utc on june20 by early on june21 a large extratropical trough spawned a low pressure area which resulted in baroclinic activity as a result agnes restrengthened into a tropical storm at 1800utc on june21 while centered over eastern north carolina three hours later the national hurricane center noted decreasing atmospheric pressures and indicated that winds had reached gale-force winds and once again upgraded agnes to a tropical storm by early on june22 agnes emerged into the northwestern atlantic ocean where it continued to re-intensify at 1200utc agnes reached its minimum atmospheric pressure of 977mbar 28.9inhg as reported by a reconnaissance aircraft however maximum sustained winds were at only 70mph 110kmh late on june22 agnes made its final landfall on long beach new york on long island with winds of 65mph 100kmhagnes began its long life as an extratropical cyclone once cold air invaded its circulation late on june22 the system looped across south-central pennsylvania on june23 and then looped across southern ontario on june25 it spawned a tornado in maniwaki ontario early that day which killed two and injured 11people the cyclone sped east-northeast reaching cape breton on june27 before intensifying as it re-entered the north atlantic after moving as far north as the 61stparallel while crossing the 25thmeridian west on the morning of june29 agnes turned southeastward its central pressure bottomed out near 980 millibars 29inhg towards 0000 utc on june30 between july1 and july3 the long-lived system looped between ireland and iceland while weakening once more the system turned northeast strengthening one more time while accelerating across the hebrides on july4 through 5 a stronger system moving in from the west finally absorbed agnes on july6 while finally located to the southeast of icelandby 2200utc on june17 the national weather service issued gale warnings and a hurricane watch for the straits of florida and the florida keys from key west to dry tortugas on the following day at 1600utc another hurricane watch was put into effective from cedar key to pensacola in addition the gale warnings in the florida keys were extended to include areas from fort myers beach to clearwater at 2200utc on june18 a hurricane warning became effective from st marks to panama city the gale warnings which were in effect for the florida keys and fort myers beach to clearwater was discontinued at 1000utc on june19 it is likely that the hurricane warning was discontinued after the national hurricane center downgraded agnes to a tropical storm at 2200utc on june20 two hours later all gale warnings along the west coast of florida were discontinuedin the united states agnes affected 15states and the capital area of washington dc almost 110,000houses were impacted by agnes 3,351of which were destroyed in addition 5,211mobile homes were either damaged or completely destroyed farm buildings and small businesses also suffered extensively with 2,226 and 5,842 structures experiencing major losses or were destroyed of the 128fatalities caused by agnes 119occurred in the united states all of the damage estimates associated with agnes were within the countryagnes was at the time the costliest hurricane in the history of the united states though it has since been surpassed by numerous other stormsupon landfall agnes produced abnormally high tides along much of the florida coastline the highest tides reported were at cedar key reaching 7 feet 2.1m above normal sea levels the second largest waves were 6.4 feet 2.0m recorded at apalachicola in contrast few observations of high tides along the east coast of florida exist the highest reported was 3 feet 0.91m above average in jacksonville in alligator point at least 16homes were swept off their foundations six bridges connecting cedar key to the mainland areas of florida were submerged in addition a bridge from coquina key to st petersburg was also underwater due to high tides nearly the entire state of florida reported rainfall though it was usually in the light to moderate range among the highest amounts of precipitation recorded were 8.97 inches 228mm in naples 8.43 inches 214mm in big pine key 7.3 inches 190mm in the everglades and 7.17 inches 182mm in tallahassee near okeechobee larger amounts of rainfall may have occurred though there were no specific observations in that vicinitythough agnes made landfall as a hurricane no reports of hurricane-force winds exist however several locations observed tropical storm force winds the highest sustained winds and gusts were 52 and 69mph 84 and 111kmh both recorded at the kennedy space center other reports of at least tropical storm force sustained winds were at 39mph 63kmh in crestview and jacksonville 42mph 68kmh in flamingo 43mph 69kmh in key west and two observations of 40mph 64kmh in panama city throughout the state agnes spawned at least 15tornadoes while several tornadoes were operationally unconfirmed initially referred to as a windstorm one of those twisters destroyed 50mobile homes and a fishing camp in okeechobee as well as cause six fatalities another significant tornado occurred in cape canaveral which destroyed two homes and 30trailers it also damaged 20houses and the port canaveral coast guard station overall more than 100people were left homeless and caused 23 injuries and over 500,000 in damage the costliest tornado was also spawned in brevard county and it destroyed 44planes at the merritt island airport and an apartment building in addition several houses in a nearby subdivision were also damaged losses from this tornado are estimated at 3milliondue to a combination of high tides rainfall winds and tornadoes 96dwellings were destroyed while about 1,802suffered damage to some degree the destruction of 177mobile homes was reported and 374others were significantly damaged furthermore 988small businesses in the state were either destroyed or had major damage eight counties in florida reported at least 1million in damage including 12.1million in pinellas 7.1million in sarasota 4.1million in brevard 3.1million in pasco 2million in manatee 1.4million in wakulla and franklin 1.3million in monroe and 1million in losses in hillsborough counties although the damage toll estimated by the national hurricane center was at 8.243million the national climatic data center noted that at least 39million in losses were reported in addition nine fatalities were reported in floridain the states immediately to the north of florida impact was relatively minor rainfall was generally light in georgia though peaking at 8.55 inches 217mm in brunswick other locations that reported precipitations include 4.54 inches 115mm in albany 3.95 inches 100mm in savannah and 3.18 inches 81mm in macon during the tornado outbreak two of the tornadoes were spawned in georgia the tornado in pierce county caused 25,000 in damage and one injury losses were more significant from the twister in coffee county reaching 250,000 one mobile home in georgia suffered significant damage though it is unknown if this was related to the tornadoes though the damage from both tornadoes combined was about 275,000 the national hurricane center notes only 205,000 in lossesin alabama tides up to 1.3 feet 0.40m above normal were reported in the mobile bay area though rainfall only reached 3.93 inches 100mm and 1.08 inches 27mm in dothan and mobile precipitation from the storm in the state of alabama peaked at 7.67 inches 195mm in headland damage in the state was minor though low-lying streets in the gulf shores were floodedin some areas of south carolina the storm dropped as much as 9.5 inches 240mm of rain in less than 36hours as a result several rivers flooded along the pee dee river pastures small grains and soy bean crops near cheraw suffered major damage similar effects occurred along the congaree river near columbia though damage was lesser in greenville damage to basements streets and water systems occurred after the reedy river overflowed damage in south carolina was minor totaling to only 50,000effects were very minimal in tennessee and limited to light rainfall in the eastern portions of the state generally reaching no more than 3 inches 76mm the highest amount of precipitation recorded was 4.59 inches 117mm in unicoiin richmond four people drowned after their car plunged into the swollen james river a train bound for washington dc stopped due to flooding in richmond which temporarily stranded 537 passengers the peak creek in western virginia overflowed its banks flooding a low-income housing area of pulaski with water up to rooftops at the height of the flooding over 600 miles 970km of highways were submerged resulting in 14.8 million in damage to roads in the state severe damage also occurred to sewer and water facilities totaling to 34.5 million 95 houses were destroyed and 4,393 others were damaged while 125 mobile homes were destroyed and another were significantly affected additionally 205 small businesses were either damaged or destroyed the interstate95 i-95 purple heart bridge over northern virginias occoquan river was severely damaged and closed when rammed by a large barge carried by floodwaters in the washington dc virginia suburbs the lake barcroft dam was undermined and breached draining the entire lake previously the reservoir for alexandria vaoverall flooding was described as the worst in 50 years in virginia alone 13 fatalities and 125.9 million in losses were reportedin baltimore three children drowned when their mothers car was swept off a highway however the mother survived and was rescued by firemen using rowboats in the state of maryland damage totaled to 110million and 19fatalities were reportedhardest hit was the patapsco river valley with widespread destruction of buildings roads and railroads in the state park at daniels including its mill at ellicott city and oella the flooding was first reported in the early morning hours of june 22 and water was reported as high as 40 feet above normal river road along the patapsco was almost completely washed out more than 900 people were evacuated from their homes national guard helicopters were used to rescue workmen from the roof of the daniels plant in elkridge a family of six was forced from their home and they attempted to reach high ground in a small boat it capsized and all six held onto the boat for several hours until it reached more shallow waterin howard county a total of 704 county residents were left homeless more than 80 homes in the ellicott city area were damaged and 72 homes in elkridge were affected in laurel the 9th street bridge crossing the patuxent river was washed away by flood waters in anne arundel county all roads linking the county with baltimore city or county were closed including the baltimore beltway as were all roads near the patuxent river including waysons corner where over 300 homes were evacuated the patapsco flooded residential homes in parts of the countys north linthicum pumphrey and belle grove road brooklyn park neighborhoodsthe gwynn oak amusement park closed after suffering severe damage from flooding when hurricane agnes caused gwynns falls to overflow in 1974 the parks rides were auctioned off the carousel was moved and is still in operation on the national mall in washington dca popular footbridge in the chesapeake and ohio canal national historical park which led across a branch of the potomac river to an overlook of great falls was washed away and not rebuilt until 1996as a result of agnes rains conowingo dam astride the susquehanna river just north of the chesapeake bay recorded its all-time highest flow rate and stream heights before the river crested the water came within feet of overtopping the dam as the dams normal flood control devices seemed unable to cope engineers had placed charges to blow out a section of the dam to prevent a catastrophic failurein pennsylvania heavy rainfall was reported with much of the state experiencing more than 7 inches 180mm of precipitation furthermore a large swath of rainfall exceeding 10 inches 250mm was reported in the central part of the state overall the rains peaked at 19 inches 480mm in the western portions of schuylkill county as a result agnes is listed as the wettest tropical cyclone on record for the state of pennsylvania overall more than 100,000people were forced to leave their homes due to flooding some buildings were under 13 feet 4.0m of water in harrisburg at the governors mansion the first floor was submerged by flood waters hundreds were trapped in their homes in wilkes-barre due to the overflowing susquehanna river at the historic cemetery in forty fort 2,000caskets were washed away leaving body parts on porches roofs and in basements in luzerne county alone 25,000homes and businesses were either damaged or destroyed losses in that county totaled to 1billion in chadds ford township in delaware county the brandywine creek crested at 16.5 feet 5.0m sending flood waters into the city water poured into the first floor of an art museum in chadds ford township which threatened at least 2.5million in nc wyeth paintings though they were quickly moved to the upper floors along the allegheny river it was above flood stage in some low-lying areas during the height of the storm the river was rising at about 7 inches 180mm per hour in reading the schuylkill river reached a record flood of 31.5 feet hundreds of people were evacuated and over a hundred homes destroyed floods reached as far inland as 3rd street in the heart of the citymore than one hundred harrisburg ymca campers and staff were evacuated using two ch-47 chinook helicopters flown by the national guard at camp shikellimy located downstream of dehart dam in middle paxton township additionally 36girl scouts were rescued by state police while at a camp in york a bridge collapsed in danville which caused two diesel locomotives and several freight cars to fall into a swollen creek in the state of pennsylvania more than 68,000homes and 3,000businesses were destroyed due to the destroyed houses at least 220,000people were left homeless the damage and death toll was the highest in pennsylvania with 50fatalities and 2.3billion in losses in that state aloneon june 26 1972 three news correspondents were killed in a helicopter crash in harrisburg where they had been covering the flooding the victims were del vaughn of cbs news and sid brenner and louis clark of wcau in philadelphia and the pilot mike sedio the helicopter lost its rotor some three hundred feet above the capital city airport crashed and exploded on the runwayolean elmira and corning as well as many other southern tier towns were severely flooded sections of the former erie railroad main line between hornell and binghamton were damaged flooding in the upper allegheny river basin was particularly exacerbated by the construction of the kinzua dam less than a decade prior several towns in cattaraugus county suffered extensive road and bridge damage that four decades later has yet to be repaired with the state and local governments opting to abandon creek and river crossings instead of reconstruct them however said dam construction allegedly succeeded in preventing further damage downstream in pennsylvania and much of the flood-prone areas in the allegheny reservoir region had already been cleared of residents in preparation for the dams constructionin elmira porches and garages were ripped loose the walnut st bridge was carried away maple ave to notre dame high school was underwater and on s main st geroulds pharmacy at w hudson was engulfed by 10feet 3inches 3.12m of waterhornells damage was minimal largely due to the protection of two dam systems installed after the devastating 1935 flood both the arkport and almond dams saved hornell from the level of damage found in neighboring communities three us army corp of engineers were killed in hornell when their helicopter came in contact with power lines over crosby creekthe height of the floodwaters has been marked in the entrance to the corning museum of glass showing that much of the museum was under water to a height of about 1.6 m above the floor causing substantial damage to the collection and archives parts of corning were under more than 3 m of flood watersrainfall in west virginia was generally light though heavier in the eastern and northern panhandles of the state precipitation peaked at 7.94 inches 202mm in berkeley springs 108houses were destroyed and 1,558others suffered damage furthermore 118mobile homes were destroyed and 91were significantly affected 10farm buildings reported major losses while 18small businesses were either damaged or destroyed in the state of west virginia no fatalities were reported and damage was slightly more than 7.7millionalthough no reports of abnormally high winds or rainfall exists in ohio the storm caused minor damage to about 302dwellings and severely affected at least three houses in addition at least 100mobile homes suffered major damage northeasterly winds from the storm waves reaching a height of 15 feet 4.6m along the shore of lake erie and also caused the water level to rise by 3.5 feet 1.1m houses cars boats buildings ships and docks in the vicinity of lake erie were damaged overall losses in ohio totaled to at least 4millionwhile approaching delaware agnes produced tides about 1.5 feet 0.46m above normal at the indian river inlet high winds were also reported in the state and at the dover air force base a wind gust as high as 67mph 108kmh was reported rainfall was generally light peaking at 7.6 inches 190mm in middletown street flooding was reported and basements in low-lying area were flooded though damage in delaware was minimal one fatality occurred in that state in the washington dc area moderate rainfall was reported with precipitation amounts peaking at 13.65 inches 347mm at the washington dulles international airport significant flooding occurred and it was described as the worst in at least 44years in the georgetown section waterfront streets along the potomac river were submerged in as much as 7 feet 2.1m of water the rock creek also overflowed its banks which sent about 10 feet 3.0m of water onto the rock creek parkway as a result at least 100cars were abandoned and several motorists required rescuing by police no national monuments were affected by flood waters however about 350dwellings in washington dc suffered minor damage at the white house reporters noted wet carpets in the press room of the basement floorthough the storm passed just west of some areas in new england minimal impact in that region of the united states in connecticut winds were well below tropical storm force although a wind gust of 46mph 74kmh was reported in hartford rainfall in the state was light peaking at 1.62 inches 41mm also recorded in hartford along the coast of connecticut high tides and heavy rainfall flooded coastal roads and basements high tides occurred along the coastline of rhode island reaching 3.2 feet 0.98m above normal in providence in combination with rainfall and high tides some coastal roads were flooded strong winds felled trees and numerous limbs in massachusetts causing power outages and property damage in the western and central portions of the state one home in great barrington was struck by a tree a similar incident occurred in milford high winds in southern and eastern vermont knocked over trees and snapped off limbs which resulted in scattered power outages roads being blocked and minor property damage in mendon a tree fell on a house while two cars were damaged after being struck by limbs similar conditions occurred in new hampshire albeit effects were lesseras a precaution more than 8,000people in western cuba including on isla de la juventud isle of pines were evacuated in western cuba agnes dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 16.76 inches 426mm on isla de la juventud at cape san antonio the westernmost point in cuba precipitation reached 15.32 inches 389mm due to high winds and flooding at least 97houses were destroyed and another 270were damaged in the pinar del ro province the cities of guane and mantua were isolated by swollen rivers it was also reported that extensive crop damage occurred in low-lying areas overall seven fatalities occurred in cuba though the damage toll is unknown however some sources claim agnes caused 16fatalities and reported 24people missingin canada hurricane agnes gave heavy rains and winds over southern ontario and southern quebec causing numerous floodings around lake erie and lake ontario in the town of maniwaki quebec the storm toppled a mobile home killing two peoplefollowing the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared 14counties in florida as a disaster area including brevard county dixie county franklin county hendry county hillsborough county lee county levy county manatee county monroe county okeechobee county pasco county pinellas county sarasota county and wakulla county in panama city florida where over 25,000tourists evacuated effects were not significant as a result the city lost millions of dollars from tourism which led the officials of panama city to file a 100million lawsuit against the national weather service officials in that city believed that the national weather service and other media outlets made exaggerated and erroneous forecasts and reports on the storm 20of marylands 24counties were declared a disaster areafollowing the storm then-president of the united states richard nixon declared the states of florida virginia maryland pennsylvania and new york as disaster areas agnes had a devastating impact on the already-bankrupt railroads in the northeastern united states as lines were washed out and shipments were delayedthe resulting cost of repairing the damage was one of the factors leading to the creation of the federally financed conrailthe severe floods near lawrenceville pennsylvania were the catalyst for the construction of the tioga reservoir in 1973 the flooding in wilkes-barre pennsylvania and the adjacent town of kingston led to the construction of a levee system that in 2006 successfully prevented massive flooding and in the same year was deemed very safe and protective by the army corps of engineers the levee also protected the area from the remnants of tropical storm lee and hurricane irene in 2011 with the water cresting just barely below the height of the structure conversely the existing kinzua dam built against the wishes of the seneca nation of new york spared much of western pennsylvania from the worst flooding by filling the allegheny reservoir to capacitybecause of extensive damage and severe death tolls the name agnes was retired following this storm and will never again be used for another atlantic hurricane because the tropical cyclone naming lists were
