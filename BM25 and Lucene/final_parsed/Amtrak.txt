amtrak  wikipedia the national railroad passenger corporation doing business as amtrak  is a passenger railroad service that provides medium- and long-distance intercity service in the contiguous united states founded in 1971 to take over most of the remaining us passenger rail services it is partially government funded yet operated and managed as a for-profit corporationamtrak serves more than 500 destinations in 46 states and three canadian provinces operating more than 300 trains each day over 21,300 miles 34,000km of track some track sections allow trains to run as fast as 150mph 240kmhin fiscal year 2016 amtrak served 31.3million passengers and had 2.192 billion in revenue while employing more than 20,000 people nearly 85,700 passengers ride more than 300 amtrak trains on a daily basis nearly two-thirds of passengers come from the 10 largest metropolitan areas 83% of passengers travel on routes shorter than 400 miles 644km its headquarters is at union station in washington dcthe name amtrak is a portmanteau of the words america and trak the latter itself a sensational spelling of trackin 1916 98% of all commercial intercity travelers in the united states moved by rail and the remaining 2% moved by inland waterways nearly 42 billion passengers used railways as primary transportation passenger trains were owned and operated by the same privately owned companies that operated freight trains thereafter patronage declined in the face of competition from buses air travel and the automobile new streamlined diesel-powered trains such as the pioneer zephyr were popular with the traveling public but could not reverse the trend by 1940 railroads held just 67 percent of commercial passenger-miles in the united states in real terms passenger-miles had fallen by 40% since 1916 from 42 billion to 25 billiontraffic surged during world war ii which was aided by troop movement and gasoline rationing the railroads market share surged to 74% in 1945 with a massive 94 billion passenger-miles after the war railroads rejuvenated their overworked and neglected passenger fleets with fast and luxurious streamliners these new trains brought only temporary relief to the overall decline even as postwar travel exploded passenger travel percentages of the overall market share fell to 46% by 1950 and then 32% by 1957 the railroads had lost money on passenger service since the great depression but deficits reached 723 million in 1957 for many railroads these losses threatened financial viabilitythe causes of this decline were heavily debated the national highway system and airports both funded by the government competed directly with the railroads who paid for their own infrastructure progressive era rate regulation limited the railroads ability to turn a profit railroads also faced antiquated work rules and inflexible relationships with trade unions to take one example workers continued to receive a days pay for 100-to-150-mile 160 to 240km work days streamliners covered that in two hoursmatters approached a crisis in the 1960s passenger service route-miles fell from 107,000 miles 172,000km in 1958 to 49,000 miles 79,000km in 1970 the last full year of private operation the diversion of most us postal service mail from passenger trains to trucks airplanes and freight trains in late 1967 deprived those trains of badly-needed revenue in direct response the atchison topeka and santa fe railway filed to discontinue 33 of its remaining 39 trains ending almost all passenger service on one of the largest railroads in the country the equipment the railroads had ordered after world war ii was now twenty years old worn out and in need of replacementas passenger service declined various proposals were brought forward to rescue it the 1961 doyle report proposed that the private railroads pool their services into a single body similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968 but failed to attract support the federal government passed the high speed ground transportation act of 1965 to fund pilot programs in the northeast corridor but this did nothing to address passenger deficits in late 1969 multiple proposals emerged in congress including equipment subsidies route subsidies and lastly a quasi-public corporation to take over the operation of intercity passenger trains matters were brought to a head on march 5 1970 when the penn central the largest railroad in the northeast united states and teetering on bankruptcy filed to discontinue 34 of its passenger trainsin october 1970 congress passed and president richard nixon signed into law the rail passenger service act proponents of the bill led by the national association of railroad passengers narp sought government funding to ensure the continuation of passenger trains they conceived the national railroad passenger corporation nrpc a private entity that would receive taxpayer funding and assume operation of intercity passenger trains the original working brand name for nrpc was railpax but shortly before the company started operating it was changed to amtrak there were several key provisionsof the 26 railroads still offering intercity passenger service in 1970 only six declined to join amtrak nearly everyone involved expected the experiment to be short-lived the nixon administration and many washington insiders viewed the nrpc as a politically expedient way for the president and congress to give passenger trains a last hurrah as demanded by the public they expected amtrak to quietly disappear as public interest waned after fortune magazine exposed the manufactured mismanagement in 1974 louis w menk chairman of the burlington northern railroad remarked that the story was undermining the scheme to dismantle amtrak proponents also hoped that government intervention would be brief but their view was that amtrak would soon support itself neither view has proved correct popular support has allowed amtrak to continue in operation longer than critics imagined while financial results have made a return to private operation infeasibleamtrak began operations on may 1 1971 amtrak received no rail tracks or rights-of-way at its inception all amtraks routes were continuations of prior service although amtrak pruned about half the passenger rail network of the 364 trains operated previously amtrak only continued 182 on trains that continued to the extent possible schedules were retained with only minor changes from the official guide of the railways and under the same names several major corridors became freight-only including the ex-new york central railroads water level route across new york and ohio and grand trunk western railroads chicago to detroit route reduced passenger train schedules created headaches a 19-hour layover became necessary for eastbound travel on the james whitcomb riley between chicago and newport newsamtrak inherited problems with train stations most notably deferred maintenance and redundant facilities resulting from competing companies that served the same areas on the day it started amtrak was given the responsibility of rerouting passenger trains from the seven train terminals in chicago lasalle dearborn grand central randolph chicago northwestern terminal central and union into just one union station in new york city amtrak had to pay to maintain both penn station and grand central terminal because of the lack of track connections to bring trains from upstate new york into penn station a problem not rectified until the building of the empire connection in 1991 amtrak would abandon numerous large stations whose upkeep could no longer be justified on the other hand the creation of the los angelesseattle coast starlight from three formerly separate trains was an immediate successamtraks early years are often called the rainbow era which refers to the ad hoc arrangement of the rolling stock and locomotives from a pool of equipment acquired by amtrak at its formation that consisted of a large mix of paint schemes from their former owners this rolling stock which for the most part still bore the pre-amtrak colors and logos formed the multi-colored consists of early amtrak trains by mid-1971 amtrak began purchasing some of the equipment it had leased including 286 second-hand locomotives of the emd e and f types 30 gg1 electric locomotives and 1,290 passenger cars and continued leasing even more motive power by 1975 the official amtrak color scheme was painted on most amtrak equipment and newly purchased locomotives and rolling stock began appearingamtrak soon had the opportunity to acquire rights-of-way following the bankruptcy of several northeastern railroads in the early 1970s including penn central which owned and operated the northeast corridor nec congress passed the railroad revitalization and regulatory reform act of 1976 a large part of the legislation was directed to the creation of conrail but the law also enabled the transfer of the portions of the nec not already owned by state authorities to amtrak amtrak acquired the majority of the nec on april 1 1976 the portion in massachusetts is owned by the commonwealth and managed by amtrak the route from new haven to new rochelle is owned by the metropolitan transportation authority and the connecticut department of transportation as the new haven line this main line became amtraks jewel asset and helped the railroad generate revenue while the nec ridership and revenues were higher than any other segment of the system the cost of operating and maintaining the corridor proved to be overwhelming as a result amtraks federal subsidy was increased dramatically in subsequent years other short route segments not needed for freight operations were transferred to amtrakin its first decade amtrak fell far short of financial independence which continues today but it did find modest success rebuilding trade outside factors discouraged competing transport such as fuel shortages which increased costs of automobile and airline travel and strikes which disrupted airline operations investments in amtraks track equipment and information also made amtrak more relevant to americas transportation needs amtraks ridership increased from 16.6million in 1972 to 21 million in 1981in 1982 former secretary of the navy and retired southern railway head william graham claytor jr became president claytor came out of retirement to lead amtrak after the disastrous financial results during the carter administration 197781 despite frequent clashes with the reagan administration over funding claytor enjoyed a good relationship with john h riley the head of the federal railroad administration fra and with members of congress limited funding led claytor to use short-term debt to fund operationsbuilding on mechanical developments in the 1970s high speed washington-new york metroliner service was improved with new equipment and faster schedules travel time between new york and washington dc was reduced to under 3 hours according to the 1980 amtrak annual report a converted 12-car set saved the company approximately 250,000 a year in fuel maintenance and yard support costs amtrak completed the head-end power conversion program in 1982 demand for passenger rail service resulted in the creation of five new state-supported routes in california illinois missouri oregon and pennsylvania for a total of 15 state-supported routes across the nationridership stagnated at roughly 20million passengers per year amid uncertain government aid from 1981 to about 2000 thomas downs succeeded claytor in 1993 amtraks stated goal remained operational self-sufficiency by this time however amtrak had a large overhang of debt from years of underfunding and in the mid-1990s amtrak suffered through a serious cash crunch under downs congress included a provision in the taxpayer relief act of 1997 that resulted in amtrak receiving a 2.3billion tax refund that resolved their cash crisis however congress also instituted a glide-path to financial self-sufficiency excluding railroad retirement tax act paymentsgeorge warrington became president in 1998 with a mandate to make amtrak financially self-sufficient passengers became guests and there were expansions into express freight work but the financial plans failed amtraks inroads in express freight delivery created additional friction with competing freight operators including the trucking industry delivery was delayed of much anticipated high-speed trainsets for the improved acela express service which promised to be a strong source of income and favorable publicity along the northeast corridor between boston and washington dcridership increased during the first decade of the 21st century after implementation of capital improvements in the nec and rises in automobile fuel costs the inauguration of the high-speed acela express in late 2000 generated considerable publicity and led to major ridership gains however through the late 1990s and very early 21st century amtrak could not add sufficient express freight revenue or cut sufficient other expenditures to break even by 2002 it was clear that amtrak could not achieve self-sufficiency but congress continued to authorize funding and released amtrak from the requirement in early 2002 david l gunn replaced warrington as president in a departure from his predecessors promises to make amtrak self-sufficient in the short term gunn argued that no form of passenger transportation in the united states is self-sufficient as the economy is currently structured highways airports and air traffic control all require large government expenditures to build and operate coming from the highway trust fund and aviation trust fund paid for by user fees highway fuel and road taxes and in the case of the general fund from general taxation gunn dropped most freight express business and worked to eliminate deferred maintenancea plan by the bush administration to privatize parts of the national passenger rail system and spin off other parts to partial state ownership provoked disagreement within amtraks board of directors late in 2005 gunn was fired gunns replacement alexander kummant 200608 was committed to operating a national rail network and like gunn opposed the notion of putting the northeast corridor under separate ownership he said that shedding the systems long-distance routes would amount to selling national assets that are on par with national parks and that amtraks abandonment of these routes would be irreversible in late 2006 amtrak unsuccessfully sought annual congressional funding of 1billion for ten years in early 2007 amtrak employed 20,000 people in 46 states and served 25 million passengers a year its highest amount since its founding in 1970 politico noted a key problem the rail system chronically operates in the red a pattern has emerged congress overrides cutbacks demanded by the white house and appropriates enough funds to keep amtrak from plunging into insolvency but amtrak advocates say that is not enough to fix the systems woes joseph h boardman replaced kummant as president and ceo in late 2008 in 2011 amtrak announced its intention to build a small segment of a high-speed rail corridor from penn station in nyc under the hudson river in new tunnels and double-tracking the line to newark nj called the gateway project estimated to cost 13.5billion after years of almost revolving-door ceos at amtrak in december 2013 boardman was named railroader of the year by railway age magazine which noted that with over five years in the job he is the second-longest serving head of amtrak since it was formed more than 40 years agofrom may 2011 to may 2012 amtrak celebrated its 40th anniversary with festivities across the country that started on national train day may 7 2011 a commemorative book entitled amtrak an american story was published and a documentary was created four commemorative heritage units a 40th anniversary exhibit train toured the country the exhibit train visited 45 communities and welcomed more than 85,000 visitors it was an entirely rebuilt train powered by ge genesis locomotives and included three refurbished ex-santa fe baggage cars and a food service car four genesis locomotives were painted into retired amtrak paint schemes no 156 was in phase 1 colors no 66 was in phase 2 colors no 145 and no 822 were in phase 3 colors 822 pulled the exhibit train and no 184 was in phase 4 colors in 2014 amtrak began offering a residency program for writerson december 9 2015 boardman announced in a letter to employees that he would be leaving amtrak in september 2016 he had advised the amtrak board of directors of his decision the previous week on august 19 2016 the amtrak board of directors named former norfolk southern railway president  ceo charles wick moorman as boardmans successor with an effective date of september 1 2016 during his term moorman took no salary and said that he saw his role as one of a transitional ceo who would reorganize amtrak before turning it over to new leadershipin may and june 2017 following several service disruptions within pennsylvania station and the east river tunnels the train service announced an expedited schedule for maintenance and repairs of infrastructure which involves the complete shutdown of multiple tracks at a time amtrak has faced criticism from commuters as well as politicians for these incidents prompting responses from figures such as new jersey governor chris christie and new york governor andrew cuomo the repairs are expected to take place in summer 2017 affecting the long island rail road and new jersey transit trains during all hours who have planned additional or modified servicesin june 2017 it was announced that former delta and northwest airlines ceo richard anderson would become amtraks next president  ceo  anderson began the job on july 12 assuming the title of president immediately and serving alongside moorman as co-ceos until the end of the yearamtrak is no longer required by law to operate a national route system but it is encouraged to do so amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states lacking wyoming and south dakota amtrak services fall into three groups short-haul service on the northeast corridor state-supported short haul service outside the northeast corridor and long-distance service known within amtrak as the national network amtrak receives federal funding for the vast majority of its operations including the central spine of the northeast corridor between boston and washington dc as well as for its national long distance routes in addition to the federally funded routes amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the northeast corridor some of which connect to it or are extensions off of it in addition to its inter-city services amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including marc in maryland shore line east in connecticut and metrolink in californiaservice on the northeast corridor between boston and washington dc as well as between philadelphia and harrisburg is powered by overhead electric wires for the rest of the system diesel locomotives are used routes vary widely in frequency of service from three-days-a-week trains on the sunset limited to weekday service several times per hour on the northeast corridor nec amtrak also operates a captive bus service thruway motorcoach which provides connections to train routesthe most popular and heavily used services are those running on the nec including the acela express and northeast regional the nec runs from boston to washington dc via new york city and philadelphia some services continue into virginia the nec services accounted for 11.4million of amtraks 31.6million passengers in fiscal year 2013 outside the nec the most popular services are the short-haul corridors in california these include the pacific surfliner capitol corridor and san joaquin supplemented by an extensive network of connecting buses together the california corridor trains accounted for a combined 5,627,000 passengers in fiscal year 2013 other popular corridors include the empire service which operates between new york city and toronto ontario via albany and buffalo new york and carried about 1,538,000 passengers in 2015 and the keystone service from new york city to harrisburg pennsylvania via philadelphia that carried 1,343,000 passengers in 2015four of the six stations busiest by boardings are on the nec new york penn station first washington union station second philadelphia 30th street station third and boston south station sixth the other two are chicago union station fourth and los angeles union station fifthper passenger mile amtrak is 3040percent more energy-efficient than commercial airlines and automobiles overall though the exact figures for particular routes depend on load factor along with other variables the electrified trains in the nec are considerably more efficient than amtraks diesels and can feed energy captured from regenerative braking back to the electrical grid passenger rail is also very competitive with other modes in terms of safety per mileon-time performance is calculated differently for airlines than for amtrak a plane is considered on-time if it arrives within 15 minutes of the schedule amtrak uses a sliding scale with trips under 250 miles 400km considered late if they are more than 10 minutes behind schedule up to 30 minutes for trips over 551 miles 887km in lengthin 2005 amtraks carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per passenger kilometre were 0.116kg for comparison this is similar to a car with two people about twice as high as the uk rail average where much more of the system is electrified about four times the average us motorcoach and about eight times a finnish electric intercity train or fully loaded fifty-seat coach it is however about two thirds of the raw co2-equivalent emissions of a long-distance domestic flightintermodal connections between amtrak trains and other transportation are available at many stations most amtrak rail stations in downtown areas have connections to local public transport amtrak also code shares with united airlines providing service between newark liberty international airport via its amtrak station and airtrain newark and philadelphia 30th st wilmington stamford and new haven special codes are used to designate these intermodal routes such as zve to designate the combination of new havens union station and newark international airport and the amtrak connection between them amtrak also serves airport stations at milwaukee oakland burbank and baltimoreamtrak coordinates thruway motorcoach service to extend many of its routes especially in californiaoutside the northeast corridor and stretches of track in southern california and michigan most amtrak trains run on tracks owned and operated by privately owned freight railroads freight rail operators are required under federal law to give dispatching preference to amtrak trains some freight railroads have been accused of violating or skirting these regulations allegedly resulting in passenger trains waiting in sidings for an hour or longer while waiting for freight traffic to clear the track the railroads dispatching practices were investigated in 2008 resulting in stricter laws about train priority subsequently amtraks overall on-time performance went up from 74.7% in fiscal 2008 to 84.7% in 2009 with long-distance trains and others outside the nec seeing the greatest benefit the missouri river runner jumped from 11% to 95% becoming one of amtraks best performers the texas eagle went from 22.4% to 96.7% and the california zephyr with a 5% on-time record in 2008 went up to 78.3% this improved performance coincided with a general economic downturn resulting in the lowest freight-rail traffic volumes since at least 1988 meaning less freight traffic to impede passenger trafficamtrak carried 15,848,327 passengers in 1972 its first full year of operation ridership peaked in 2016 with a record 31,272,790 passengers double the total in 1972amtraks loyalty program guest rewards is similar to the frequent-flyer programs of many airlines guest rewards members accumulate points by riding amtrak and through other activities and can redeem these points for free or discounted amtrak tickets and other rewardsthrough various commuter services amtrak serves an additional 61.1million passengers per year in conjunction with state and regional authorities in california through amtrak california and metrolink connecticut through shore line east and maryland through marcalong the nec and in several other areas amtrak owns 730 miles 1,170km including 17 tunnels consisting of 29.7 miles 47.8km of track and 1,186 bridges including the famous hell gate bridge consisting of 42.5 miles 68.4km of track in several places primarily in new england amtrak leases tracks providing track maintenance and controlling train movements most often these tracks are leased from state regional or local governments amtrak owns and operates the following linesin addition to these lines amtrak owns station and yard tracks in chicago los angeles new orleans new york city oakland kirkham street yard orlando portland oregon saint paul seattle and washington dc amtrak leases station and yard tracks in hialeah near miami florida from the state of floridaamtrak owns the chicago union station company chicago union station and new york penn station it has a 99.7% interest in the washington terminal company tracks around washington union station and 99% of 30th street limited philadelphia 30th street station also owned by amtrak is passenger railroad insuranceamtrak owns 2,142 railway cars and 425 locomotives for revenue runs and service examples include the ge p42dc the siemens acs-64 the amfleet car and the superliner car occasionally private cars or loaned locomotives from other railroads can be found on amtrak trainsas of 2015 amtrak offers four classes of service first class sleeper service business class and coach classamtrak launched an e-ticketing system on the downeaster in november 2011 and rolled it out nationwide on july 30 2012 amtrak officials said the system gives more accurate knowledge in realtime of who is on the train which greatly improves the safety and security of passengers en route reporting of onboard equipment problems to mechanical crews which may result in faster resolution of the issue and more efficient financial reportingamtrak first offered free wi-fi service to passengers aboard the downeaster in 2008 the acela express and the northeast regional trains on the nec in 2010 and the amtrak cascades in 2011 in february 2014 amtrak rolled out wi-fi on corridor trains out of chicago when all the midwest cars offer the amtrakconnect service about 85% of all amtrak passengers nationwide will have wi-fi access as of 2014 most amtrak passengers have access to free wi-fi the service has developed a reputation for being unreliable and slowamtrak allows carry-on baggage on all routes services with baggage cars allow checked baggage at selected stations with the passage of the wicker amendment in 2010 passengers are allowed to put lawfully owned unloaded firearms in checked amtrak baggage reversing a decade-long ban on such carriageamtrak express reporting marks amtk amtz provides small-package and less-than-truckload shipping among more than 100 cities amtrak express also offers station-to-station shipment of human remains to many express cities at smaller stations funeral directors must load and unload the shipment onto and off the train amtrak hauled mail for the united states postal service and time-sensitive freight but canceled these services in october 2004 due to minuscule profits on most parts of the few lines that amtrak owns trackage-rights agreements allow freight railroads to use its trackagein the modern era amtrak faces a number of important labor issues in the area of pension funding because of limitations originally imposed by congress most amtrak workers were traditionally classified as railroad employees and contributions to the railroad retirement system have been made for those employees however because the size of the contributions is determined on an industry-wide basis rather than with reference to the employer for whom the employees work some critics such as the national association of railroad passengers maintain that amtrak is subsidizing freight railroad pensions by as much as us150 millionyearin recent times efforts at reforming passenger rail have addressed labor issues in 1997 congress released amtrak from a prohibition on contracting for labor outside the corporation and outside its unions opening the door to privatization since that time many of amtraks employees have been working without a contract the most recent contract signed in 1999 was mainly retroactivebecause of the fragmentation of railroad unions by job as of 2009 amtrak has 14 separate unions to negotiate with plus it has 24 separate contracts with those unions this makes it difficult to make substantial changes in contrast to a situation where one union negotiates with one employer former amtrak president kummant followed a cooperative posture with amtraks trade unions ruling out plans to privatize large parts of amtraks unionized workforceamtrak receives annual appropriations from federal and state governments to supplement operating and capital programsamtrak commenced operations in 1971 with 40million in direct federal aid 100million in federally insured loans and a somewhat larger private contribution officials expected that amtrak would break even by 1974 but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of 1.25billion during the reagan administration appropriations were halved and by 1986 federal support fell to a decade low of 601million almost none of which were capital appropriations in the late 1980s and early 1990s congress continued the reductionist trend even while amtrak expenses held steady or rose amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs and by 1995 amtrak was on the brink of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts in response in 1997 congress authorized 5.2billion for amtrak over the next five years  largely to complete the acela capital project  on the condition that amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation while amtrak made financial improvements during this period it did not achieve self-sufficiencyin 2004 a stalemate in federal support of amtrak forced cutbacks in services and routes as well as resumption of deferred maintenance in fiscal 2004 and 2005 congress appropriated about 1.2billion for amtrak 300million more than president george w bush had requested however the companys board requested 1.8billion through fiscal 2006 the majority of which about 1.3billion would be used to bring infrastructure rolling stock and motive power back to a state of good repair in congressional testimony the dot inspector general confirmed that amtrak would need at least 1.4billion to 1.5billion in fiscal 2006 and 2billion in fiscal 2007 just to maintain the status quo in 2006 amtrak received just under 1.4billion with the condition that amtrak would reduce but not eliminate food and sleeper service losses thus dining service was simplified and now requires two fewer on-board service workers only auto train and empire builder services continue regular made-on-board meal service in 2010 the senate approved a bill to provide 1.96billion to amtrak but cut the approval for high-speed rail to a 1billion appropriation
state governments have partially filled the breach left by reductions in federal aid several states have entered into operating partnerships with amtrak notably california pennsylvania illinois michigan oregon missouri washington north carolina oklahoma texas wisconsin vermont maine and new york as well as the canadian province of british columbia which provides some of the resources for the operation of the cascades routewith the dramatic rise in gasoline prices during 200708 amtrak has seen record ridership capping a steady five-year increase in ridership overall regional lines saw 12% year-over-year growth in may 2008 in october 2007 the senate passed s-294 passenger rail improvement and investment act of 2007 7022 sponsored by senators frank lautenberg and trent lott despite a veto threat by president bush a similar bill passed the house on june 11 2008 with a veto-proof margin 311104 the final bill spurred on by the september 12 metrolink collision in california and retitled rail safety improvement act of 2008 was signed into law by president bush on october 16 2008 the bill appropriates 2.6billion a year in amtrak funding through 2013amtrak points out that in 2010 its farebox recovery percentage of operating costs covered by revenues generated by passenger fares was 79% the highest reported for any us passenger railroadamtrak has argued that it needs to increase capital program costs in 2013 in order to replace old train equipment because the multi-year maintenance costs for those trains exceeds what it would cost to simply buy new equipment that would not need to be repaired for several years however despite an initial request for more than 2.1 billion in funding for the year the company had to deal with a year-over-year cut in 2013 federal appropriations dropping to under 1.4 billion for the first time in several years amtrak stated in 2010 that the backlog of needed repairs of the track it owns on the northeast corridor included over 200 bridges most dating to the 19th century tunnels under baltimore dating to the american civil war era and functionally obsolete track switches which would cost 5.2 billion to repair more than triple amtraks total annual budget amtraks budget is only allocated on a yearly basis and it has been argued by joseph vranich that this makes multi-year development programs and long-term fiscal planning difficult if not impossiblein fiscal year 2011 the us congress granted amtrak 563 million for operating and 922 million for capital programsgovernment aid to amtrak was controversial from the beginning the formation of amtrak in 1971 was criticized as a bailout serving corporate rail interests and union railroaders not the traveling public critics have asserted that amtrak has proven incapable of operating as a business and that it does not provide valuable transportation services meriting public support a mobile money-burning machine many argued that subsidies should be ended national rail service terminated and the nec turned over to private interests to fund a nostalgia limited is not in the public interest critics also question amtraks energy efficiency though the us department of energy considers amtrak among the most energy-efficient forms of transportationthe rail passenger service act of 1970 which established amtrak specifically states that the corporation will not be an agency or establishment of the united states government then common stock was issued in 1971 to railroads that contributed capital and equipment these shares convey almost no benefits but their current holders declined a 2002 buy-out offer by amtrak there are currently 109,396,994 shares of preferred stock at a par value of 100 per share all held by the us government there are currently 9,385,694 shares of common stock with a par value of 10 per share held by four other railroad companies apu formerly penn central 53% bnsf 35% canadian pacific 7% and canadian national 5%the following are major accidents and incidents that involved amtrak trainstopics dealing with amtrakrail companies of interestother national railroads
