1928 okeechobee hurricane  wikipedia the okeechobee hurricane also known as the san felipe segundo hurricane was one of the deadliest hurricanes in the recorded history of the north atlantic basin the fourth tropical cyclone third hurricane and only major hurricane of the 1928 season this system developed just offshore the west coast of africa on september6 initially a tropical depression it strengthened into a tropical storm later that day shortly before passing south of the cape verde islands further intensification was slow and halted by late on september7 about 48hours later the storm resumed strengthening and became a category1 hurricane on the modern-day saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale still moving westward the system reached category4 intensity before striking guadeloupe on september12 there the storm brought great destruction and 1,200deaths the islands of martinique montserrat and nevis also reported damage and fatalities but not nearly as severe as in guadeloupearound midday on september13 the storm strengthened into a category5 hurricane and peaked with sustained winds of 160mph 260kmh about six hours later the system made landfall in puerto rico it remains the only recorded category5 to strike the island as of 2017 very strong winds resulted in severe damage in puerto rico throughout the island an estimated 24,728homes were destroyed and 192,444were damaged leaving over 500,000people homeless heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture on puerto rico alone there were 312deaths and about 50 million usd 697 million today in damage while crossing the island and emerging into the atlantic the storm weakened slightly falling to category4 intensity the storm began crossing through the bahamas on september16 where it resulted in 18 fatalitiesearly on september17 the storm made landfall near west palm beach florida with winds of 145mph 233kmh in the city more than 1,711homes were destroyed elsewhere in the county impact was most severe around lake okeechobee the storm surge caused water to pour out of the southern edge of the lake flooding hundreds of square miles as high as 20 feet 6.1m above ground numerous houses and buildings were swept away in the cities of belle glade canal point chosen pahokee and south bay at least 2,500people drowned while damage was estimated at 25million while crossing florida the system weakened significantly falling to category1 intensity late on september17 it curved north-northeastward and briefly re-emerged into the atlantic on september18 but soon made another landfall near edisto island south carolina with winds of 85mph 140kmh early on the following day the system weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical over north carolina hours later overall the system caused 100million in damage and at least 4,079deathson september6 ships reported a tropical depression developing just off the west coast of africa near dakar senegal the next day a ship reported winds of 60mph 95kmh or tropical storm status on this basis the atlantic hurricane reanalysis project estimated that the system attained tropical storm status late on september6 however lack of observations for several days prevented the system from being classified in real time as it moved generally westward across the atlantic ocean on september10 the ss commack first observed the storm about 900miles 1450km to the east of guadeloupe which at the time was the most easterly report of a tropical cyclone ever received through ships radio later that day two other ships confirmed the intensity of the storm and the hurricane research division estimated it strengthened into a hurricane at 18:00utc on september10as the storm neared the lesser antilles it continued to intensify between 17:30 and 18:30utc on september12 the hurricanes eye moved over guadeloupe with a barometric pressure of 940 millibars 28inhg suggesting maximum sustained winds of 240kmh 140mph or category 4 on the saffirsimpson scale continuing to the west-northwest the hurricane passed about 10mi 16km south of saint croix before approaching puerto rico on september13 the 15mi 25km eye crossed puerto rico in eight hours from the southeast to the northwest moving ashore near guayama and exiting between aguadilla and isabela a ship near the southern coast reported a pressure of 931mbar 27.5inhg and the cup anemometer at san juan reported sustained winds of 160mph 257kmh before failing as the wind station was 30miles 50km north of the storms center winds near the landfall point were unofficially estimated as high as 200mph 320kmh on this basis the hurricane is believed to have made landfall in puerto rico as a category 5 hurricane on the saffir-simpson scale although there was uncertainty in the peak intensity due to the large size and slow movement of the stormafter emerging from puerto rico the hurricane had weakened to winds of about 140mph 240kmh based on a pressure reading of 941mbar 27.8inhg at isabela the storm brushed the northern coast of hispaniola while moving west-northwestward gradually restrengthening on september15 it passed within 35mi 55km of grand turk by which time the winds increased to 155mph 250kmh the storm continued through the bahamas as a strong category 4 hurricane passing near nassau at 10:00utc on september16 initially richard gray of the us weather bureau was optimistic that the storm would spare south florida however at 00:00utc on september17 the large hurricane made landfall in southeastern florida near west palm beach with estimated winds of 145mph 230kmh this was based on a pressure reading of 929mbar 27.4inhg in the city which at the time was the lowest pressure reading in the mainland united states this broke the previous record of 935mbar 27.6inhg set during the 1926 miami hurricane peak gusts were estimated near 160mph 260kmh at canal pointthe hurricane quickly weakened as it progressed inland and moved over lake okeechobee although the large size allowed it to maintain hurricane status for several more days late on september17 the hurricane recurved to the northeast and passed near jacksonville early the next day with winds of 75mph 120kmh at 08:00utc on september18 the storm once again reached open waters later that day the hurricane restrengthened slightly over open waters making a second united states landfall near edisto island south carolina at 19:00utc with winds of 85mph 140kmh accelerating northeastward the system quickly weakened into a tropical storm over north carolina on september19 the storm evolved into an extratropical cyclone although it restrengthened slightly to hurricane status the cyclone turned to the north-northwest moving quickly through the eastern united states on september21 the former hurricane dissipated over ontario having merged with another disturbancethe hurricane moved directly over the leeward islands in the caribbean sea strengthening as it did so on the island of dominica winds were clocked at 24mph 39kmh there were no reports of damage though one fatality occurred in martinique even further south of the storms path there were three fatalities guadeloupe received a direct hit from the storm apparently with little warning the death toll there was 1,200 and damage reports relayed through paris indicated great destruction on the island about three-fourths of the islands residents were left homeless in the community of saint-franois the only structure to remain standing was the police station which was built with reinforced concrete to the east of the town the merchant ship albatros carrying 80casks of rum sank the crew and the five men attempting to save the ship drowned approximately 85%95% of banana crops were destroyed 70%80% of tree crops suffered severe damage and 40% of the sugar cane crop was ruinedmontserrat just north of the storms center was warned in advance of the storm but still suffered 150,000 1928 ukp in damages and 42 deaths plymouth and salem were devastated and crop losses caused near-starvation conditions before relief could arrive all commercial and government buildings on the island were destroyed as were more than 600homes saint kitts and nevis also suffered heavily on the island of st kitts a number of homes built on wooden foundations were demolished nine deaths were reported six of which occurred as a result of a schoolhouse collapse thirteen people were killed on the island of nevisthe storm destroyed hundreds of home on antigua including a doctors home and a poor house government offices hospitals and school were also damaged on saint croix nearly all of the islands 11,000residents suffered some degree of loss a total of 143buildings were destroyed including a sugar mill the storm left nine deaths on the island throughout the virgin islands as many as 700,000people were rendered homelesswhile the storm was passing near dominica the san juan puerto rico weather bureau warned about the threat of the hurricane which would strike the island within a day or two the advisory was sent via telegraph to 75police districts and was broadcast from the naval radio station every two hours this was the first hurricane warning broadcast by radio warnings were also posted for 12ports along the southern coast causing ships to avoid the island or remain at port effective preparation is credited for the relatively low death toll of 312 and not a single ship was lost at sea in the vicinity of puerto rico by comparison the weaker 1899 san ciriaco hurricane killed approximately 3,000peopleaccording to the san juan national weather service office the storm was up to this time the greatest and more  sic intense and destructive hurricane of record in puerto rico along the storm path the eye passed over guayama cayey and aibonito resulting in a period of calm lasting 20minutes the island of puerto rico received the worst of the storms winds when the hurricane moved directly across the island at category 5 strength the hurricane was extremely large as it crossed puerto rico hurricane-force winds were measured in guayama for 18hours since the storm is estimated to have been moving at 13mph 21kmh the diameter of the storms hurricane winds was estimated very roughly to be 234miles 376kmthe storm was named the san felipe ii hurricane because the eye of the cyclone made landfall on the christian feast day of saint philip it was named segundo spanish for the second because of another destructive san felipe hurricane which struck puerto rico on that same day in 1876 since european arrival in the americas in 1492 all storms and hurricanes were named after the name of the saint of the day the storm hit puerto rico in 1953 the united states started naming hurricanes by female names until 1978 when both gender names began to be used yet it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after saintsthe rainfall recorded on september 1314 1928 remains the record for the maximum rainfall associated with a hurricane in puerto rico within a period of forty-eight hours in those regions where precipitation is more common place as in adjuntas in the cordillera central and in the sierra de luquillo the rain was over 25 inches 640mm with 29.60 inches 752mm recorded in adjuntas the anemometer located in puerta de tierra lost one of its cups at 11:44am on september 13 just when it had registered a maximum speed of 150 miles 240km per houra speed that was sustained for five consecutive minutes previously the same instrument had measured 160 miles 260km per hour for one minute because these measurements were taken 30 miles 48km from san felipes eye at the time it seemed possible that some estimates of 200 miles 320km per hour near the center of the storm were not overdrawnthere was general destruction through the island with the towns where the eye passed being swept away property damage on the island from winds and rain was catastrophic the northeast portion of the island received winds in excess of category3 strength with hurricane-force winds lasting as long as 18hours official reports stated several hundred thousand people were left homeless and property damages were estimated at 50millionon the island there was no building that was not affected some sugar mills centrales that had cost millions of dollars to build were reduced to rubble reports say that 24,728 homes were destroyed and 192,444 were partially destroyed most of the sugarcane fields were flooded ruining the years crops half of the coffee plants and half of the shade trees that covered these were destroyed almost all of the coffee harvest was lost the coffee industry would take years to recover since coffee needs shade trees to grow the tobacco farms also had great losses after this hurricane puerto rico never regained its position as a major coffee exportercommunications were impacted by fallen trees landslides and damaged bridges of the school buildings 770were destroyed or damaged according to some estimates of the day excluding personal losses the damages reached 85.312million and over 500,000people were left homeless san felipe ii is officially classified as puerto ricos biggest worst and most devastating hurricane to ever have impacted the islandafter affecting puerto rico the hurricane passed just north of the dominican republic producing very little damage this was due to the small core and weaker winds to the south of the center advance warning reduced the number of ships traversing the regionwhile the hurricane was passing nearby grand turk reported winds of 120mph 193kmh according to a ship report in the region the force of the wind could only be judged by the noise made by the storm which reminded me of the new york subway going full speed passing switches winds approached 120mph 193kmh at nassau before the anemometer failed in addition to the winds the storm dropped heavy rainfall in the region totaling 9in 228mm in nassau as in puerto rico authorities in the bahamas had ample warning of the hurricanes approach and preparations minimized the loss of life in the islands two boats were wrecked as they washed ashore in grand turk although the crews were saved a sloop traversing from ambergris caye to grand turk was lost killing all 18people on board the storm caused heavy damage throughout the bahamas mostly to property and cropsin nassau some buildings which were recently repaired after the 1926 nassau hurricane were destroyed during this storm a 10-year-old girl drowned after falling into an open trench filled with water at the fort montague hotel the windows doors and furniture were badly damaged similar impact was reported at the royal victoria hotel while the british colonial hotel was largely spared however the gardens of the three hotels were damaged almost beyond recognitionon bimini sustained winds of 140mph 230kmh were observed causing major damage to buildings ninety-five houses and some other buildings including a few churches and government buildings were damaged or destroyed on eleuthera minor damage was reported on rum cay most of the food crops were destroyed on san salvador island four buildings were demolished including two churches while several other structures suffered minor damage food crops were nearly wiped outwhile the hurricane was moving through the bahamas the weather bureau issued storm warnings from miami to titusville later upgrading to a hurricane warning from miami to daytona beach the agency advised residents to take precautions for the hurricane citing the potential for strong winds and waves hurricane warnings were also posted for the west coast from punta rassa to apalachicola and after the storm recurved hurricane warnings were extended along the east coast to jacksonville because of well-issued hurricane warnings residents were prepared for the storm and the number of lives lost in the coastal palm beach area was only 26strong winds struck southern florida as the hurricane moved ashore with three unofficial reports of 100mph 160kmh in miami to the south of the center winds reached 78mph 126kmh and farther south key west reported winds of only 39mph 63kmh the eye at landfall was 25mi 40km wide and after moving inland crossed lake okeechobee where a calm was reported for 30minutes winds at canal point adjacent to the lake were estimated as high as 160mph 255kmh the anemometer blew away after reporting sustained winds of 75mph 120kmh the pressure at canal point dropped to 942mbar 27.82inhg the lowest pressure north of lake okeechobee was 966mbar 28.54inhg in bartow and along the west coast winds reached 31mph 50kmh in tampathe hurricane left thousands of people homeless in florida property damage was estimated at 25million 349million it is estimated if a similar storm were to strike as of the year 2003 it would cause 18.7billion in damages the cyclone remains one of three atlantic hurricanes to strike the southern mainland of florida with a central pressure below 940mbar 27.76inhg the others being the 1926 miami hurricane and hurricane andrew of 1992in addition to the human fatalities 1,278livestock and 47,389 poultry were killed respectively agriculture was impacted significantly with the storm destroying what may have been the largest citrus crop in the history of the industry approximately 6% of oranges and 18% of grapefruit were ruined respectively harvesting the remaining crops was delayed until mid-october due to inundated groves communications also suffered severely throughout the state 32,000households were left without telephone service and 400poles were broken and about 2,500others leaning then-governor of florida john w martin estimated that 15,000families were left homeless in palm beach county alone additionally about 11,500families would need to be re-establishedin miami damage was minimal limited to broken windows and awnings in hollywood and fort lauderdale windows and roofs were damaged although damage was still fairly minor numerous power lines and telephone wires were downed in the latter northward from pompano beach to jupiter buildings suffered serious damage from the heavy winds and 10ft 3m storm surge nearly all small frame houses were destroyed in deerfield beach while several citizens estimated that at least 50% of homes were demolished the towns post office depot and an entire business block were also destroyed an eight-year-old boy drowned in a ditch near where his family sought refuge in boca raton two garages and several houses were destroyed at the cloister inn windows were shattered and the roof was damaged across the street 32freight cars belonging to a train along the florida east coast railway were tossed by the wind into a nearby ditch a short distance to the north a warehouse was flattened a building occupied by a restaurant and a store was flattened in delray beach four churches suffered severe damage and the alta repp and seacrest hotels both lost a portion of their roof the police reported three deaths within the city in delray beach and lantana all houses and the railroad station were badly damaged in boynton beach about 75% of businesses suffered complete destruction fifteen people were injured by a roof collapse while taking refuge in the auditorium of a high schoolin lake worth approximately 50% of homes were damaged or destroyed while 75% of buildings in the business district suffered damage impact along the coast was most severe in palm beach total coastal damages were estimated as several million dollars in west palm beach the storm destroyed 1,711homes and damaged 6,369others and demolished 268businesses and impacted 490other businesses the city suffered the worst damage totaling just under 13.8million likewise there was also severe wind damage in palm beach a few buildings constructed by henry flagler such as the breakers the royal poinciana hotel and whitehall were damaged mar-a-lago suffered little impact other than uprooted trees and the destruction of a large roman-style window according to marjorie merriweather post rodman wanamakers house known as la guerida and later the winter white house during the presidency of john f kennedy suffered heavy damage during the storm the alba billows new palm beach and royal daneli hotels all suffered water damage while the alba hotel was also deroofed nearby the rainbow pier only received structural damage to its railings though the pier office was blown away approximately 600structures including 10 hotels were damaged in palm beach damage totaled over 2millionthe strongest winds in the eyewall affected northern palm beach county particularly the vicinity of jupiter as the eye made landfall farther south at the jupiter inlet lighthouse the mortar was reportedly squeezed like toothpaste between the bricks during the storm swaying the tower 17in 430mm off the base the lighthouse keeper captain seabrook and his son franklin worked to keep the light on during the storm after the electricity went out after the generator failed to work they hand-cranked the lights mantle the building formerly used as a weather bureau office was destroyed nearby six people died after a house was demolished six other fatalities occurred west of jupiter after a school where people sought shelter collapsedinland the hurricane wreaked much more widespread destruction along the more heavily populated coast of lake okeechobee residents had been warned to evacuate the low ground earlier in the day but after the hurricane did not arrive on schedule many thought it had missed and returned to their homes in the weeks prior to storm heavy rainfall caused the lake to rise 3ft 0.91m between august10 and september10 and filled nearby canals and ditches precipitation from the hurricane itself caused lake okeechobee to rise further when the worst of the storm crossed the lake the south-blowing wind caused a storm surge to overflow the small dike that had been built at the south end of the lake the resulting flood covered an area of hundreds of square miles with water that in some places was over 20ft 6m deep houses were floated off of their foundations and dashed to pieces against any obstacle they encountered most survivors and bodies were washed out into the everglades where many of the bodies were never found agricultural losses in the area surrounding lake okeechobee were also significant with virtually all crops destroyed and over 150tractors suffering damageas the rear eyewall passed over the area the flood reversed itself breaking the dikes along the northern coast of the lake and causing similar but smaller flooding route 98 then known as conners highway was closed until january when the bridge across the onosohatchee river at taylor creek was replaced after the original bridge was carried about 150ft 46m upstream during the storm in okeechobee county homes along the lake were destroyed by the storm surge while dwellings within the city of okeechobee were severely impacted or demolished by winds of at least 90mph 140kmh however brick and concrete-structured dwellings received little damage a number of three-story business buildings collapsed during the storm almost all roads were left impassable while communications were nearly wiped out overall 27deaths occurred in okeechobee county along the southwestern shore of lake okeechobee the towns of clewiston and moore haven were both flooded but much of the damage to houses was due to strong windson kreamer island many residents received information about the storm when it was too late to evacuate in some homes 2030people sought shelter inside and later stood on tables and chairs to remain above the water most of the homes were swept away into rows of pine trees and others more than half a mile 0.8km away despite this only one person drowned on the island residents of torry island also did not have ample time to prepare for the storm they attempted to evacuate but the causeway was already inundated forcing twenty-three people to seek refuge in a packinghouse floodwaters entered the building forcing the occupants into the rafters however the building was eventually pushed into a nearby canal ten people drowned but thirteen others survived by clinging to a barge or tree tops while one woman tied herself to a telegraph pole others that survived were swept far away from where the building once stood or the barge a teenage boy was carried from the packinghouse to the everglades experiment station in belle glade  a distance of about 8mi 13km on ritta island a number who successfully climbed to the roof of their houses were struck by trees or received fatal bites from water moccasinin south bay nearly all houses were destroyed and several buildings were unroofed at least 160fatalities occurred in the city the future first mayor of south bay aubrey aka orb or ao walker along with his brother haughty d walker aka haught survived the great hurricane of 1928 by gathering family members and joining a number of other south bay citizens on a barge in the canal which allowed them to survive the flood waters that swept over south bay and ultimately engulfed okeelanta  throughout the 1920s okeelanta suffered several floods and muck fires finally the town was flooded severely during the storm and was subsequently abandoned bean city was also destroyed during the hurricane but it was eventually rebuilt by arthur wells sebring farms was reduced to piles of rubber with only four tall royal palm trees left standing only the hotel at miami locks survived the storm ninety-nine people died in that town in chosen only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people twenty other residents took refuge in a building which lost its roof during the storm forcing the occupants to move into the restroom a house that was full of people floated about half a mile 0.8km from its original location the refugees were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankmentfloodwaters persisted for several weeks greatly impeding attempts to clean up the devastation burial services were quickly overwhelmed and many of the bodies were placed into mass graves around 75% of the fatalities were migrant farm workers making identification of both dead and missing bodies very difficult as a result of this the count of the dead is not very accurate the red cross estimated the number of fatalities as 1,836 which was taken as the official count by the national weather service for many years and exactly equal to the official count for hurricane katrina older sources usually list 3,411 as the hurricanes total count of fatalities including the caribbean however in 2003 the us death count was revised to at least 2,500 making the okeechobee hurricane the second-deadliest natural disaster in united states history behind the 1900 galveston hurricane a mass grave at the port mayaca cemetery east of port mayaca contains the bodies of 1,600 victims of the hurricanein fort myers property damage was slight limited mostly to scores of small boats and fishing shacks along the waterfront nearly all cigar factories in tampa were closed after wind and rain drove too much moisture into the buildings offshore the fishing smack wallace a mcdonnell was beached near piney point though all of the crew survived additionally the cuban schooner isabel alvado sank offshore boca grande the crew who were immigrants were rescued by the coast guard and later deported in martin county a bridge connecting stuart and palm city was severely damaged and closed to traffic as a result a temporary ferry service across the st lucie river was established and operated until repairs to the bridge were complete in the summer of 1929 in fort pierce most of the impact was confined to the waterfront areas a warehouse fish houses docks and a bridge across the indian river were destroyed while several other buildings were unroofed damage in the city totaled about 150,000in the interior areas of central and north florida impact was mainly confined to agricultural losses particularly citrus though wind damage occurred to structures between sebring and lake wales 200telephone poles were toppled in bartow business building windows were shattered and signs were knocked down while several roofs and chimneys also suffered damage winds gusting up to 70mph 110kmh lashed lakeland many trees were uprooted and several buildings were impacted including the hospital and a number of businesses at florida southern college fsc the north side of the gymnasium collapsed while other buildings on campus were damaged to a lesser degree the trees in the citrus grove surrounding fsc lost much of their fruit overall lakeland suffered about 50,000 in damage in orlando impact to properties was described as slight winds up to 50mph 80kmh impacted the jacksonville area resulting in minor damage at jacksonville beachoutside of florida damage in the united states was minor from the hurricane in georgia low-lying streets were flooded or washed out in the savannah area additionally winds downed trees and power lines heavy rainfall occurred from eastern florida through coastal georgia the carolinas and southeast virginia the highest rainfall total was 12.53 inches 318mm at darlington south carolina the storm caused flooding in north carolina and brought near-hurricane-force winds and a 7foot 2.1m storm surge to the norfolk area after the hurricane became extratropical its wind field became very large atlantic city new jersey recorded winds of 76mph 122kmh despite being far from the centerin the immediate aftermath of the storm relief arrived from nearby areas such as miami early on september18 a train leaving miami carried 20doctors and 20nurses to west palm beach the miami red cross citizens relief committee which was established to provide aid for victims of the storm transported hundreds of loaves of bread gallons of milk pounds of coffee and sugar blankets cots and medical supplies the first relief train was ridden by us senator joseph t robinson the democratic vice presidential nominee during the election that year at least 100people were brought to miami for medical treatment in lake worth 25people were treated for various injuries at the gulf stream hotel and the local fire station dr w a claxton chief of the miami department of public welfare requested antitoxin typhoid serum and at least 200tetanus serums there was also a request for 1,000more cots in west palm beach and kelsey cityin florida although the hurricanes destruction affected everything in its path the death toll was by far highest and the aftermath the worst in the economically poor areas in the low-lying ground right around lake okeechobee such as belle glade chosen pahokee south bay and bean city around 75% of the fatalities were among migrant farm workers most of whom were blackthe black workers did most of the post-hurricane cleanup work and the few caskets available for burials were mostly used for the bodies of whites additionally the white victims received a proper burial at woodlawn cemetery in downtown west palm beach which was the only mass gravesite to receive a timely memorialin contrast the bodies of black victims were burned in funeral pyres or thrown into mass burial sites such as the ones in west palm beach and port mayacarobert hazard a resident of west palm beach established the storm of 28 memorial park coalition inc to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm in 2000 the west palm beach burial site was reacquired by the city of west palm beach and plans for construction of a memorial began the site was listed on the us national register of historic places in 2002 and a state historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricanethe effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers were dramatized in african-american writer zora neale hurstons 1937 seminal novel their eyes were watching god her best known work and a selection on time magazines 2005 list of the 100 best english-language novels published since 1923in the aftermath of the hurricane in coastal florida it became apparent that well-constructed buildings with shutters had suffered practically no damage from winds that caused serious structural problems to lesser buildings buildings with well-constructed frames and those made of steel concrete brick or stone were largely immune to winds and the use of shutters prevented damage to windows and the interior of the buildings coming on the heels of the 1926 miami hurricane where a similar pattern had been noticed one lasting result of the 1928 storm was improved building codesto prevent a recurrence of disasters like this one and the great miami hurricane of 1926 the florida state legislature created the okeechobee flood control district which was authorized to cooperate with the us army corps of engineers in flood control undertakings after a personal inspection of the area by president herbert hoover the corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels control gates and major levees along lake okeechobees shores a long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control water conservation prevention of saltwater intrusion and preservation of fish and wildlife populations one of the solutions was the construction of the herbert hoover dike today concerns related to the dikes stability have grown in response to studies indicating long term problems with piping and erosion leaks have been reported after several heavy rain events proposed solutions to the dikes problems have included the construction of a seepage berm on the landward side of the dike with the first stage costing approximately 67million us
