was the native name given to the entire island of hispaniola to mean land of high mountains the h is silent in french and the  in hati is a diacritical mark used to show that the second vowel is pronounced separately as in the word nave in english this rule for the pronunciation is often disregarded thus the spelling haiti is used there are different anglicizations for its pronunciation such as high-ti high-ee-ti and haa-ee-ti which are still in use but hay-ti is the most widespread and establishedthe name was restored by haitian revolutionary jean-jacques dessalines as the official name of independent saint-domingue as a tribute to the amerindian predecessorsin french haitis nickname is the pearl of the antilles la perle des antilles because of both its natural beauty and the amount of wealth it accumulated for the kingdom of france as it was considered the richest colony owned by any of the european powers at the timeat the time of european encounter the island of hispaniola of which haiti occupies the western three-eighths was one of many caribbean islands inhabited by the tano indians speakers of an arawakan language called taino which has been preserved in the haitian creole language the tano name for the entire island was haiti the people had migrated over centuries into the caribbean islands from south america genetic studies show they were related to the yanomami of the amazon basin they also originated in central and south america after migrating to caribbean islands in the 15th century the tano were pushed into the northeast caribbean islands by the caribsin the tano societies of the caribbean islands the largest unit of political organization was led by a cacique or chief as the europeans understood them the island of haiti was divided among five caciquats the magua in the north east the marien in the north west the xaragua in the south west the maguana in the center region of cibao and the higuey in the south east the caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms with payment consisting of harveststano cultural artifacts include cave paintings in several locations in the country these have become national symbols of haiti and tourist attractions modern-day logane started as a french colonial town in the southwest is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of xaraguanavigator christopher columbus landed in haiti on 5 december 1492 in an area that he named mle saint-nicolas and claimed the island for the crown of castile nineteen days later his ship the santa mara ran aground near the present site of cap-hatien columbus left 39 men on the island who founded the settlement of la navidadthe sailors carried endemic eurasian infectious diseases the natives lacked immunity to these new diseases and died in great numbers in epidemics the first recorded smallpox epidemic in the americas erupted on hispaniola in 1507 the  system forced natives to work in gold mines and plantationsthe spanish passed the laws of burgos 151213 which forbade the maltreatment of natives endorsed their conversion to catholicism and gave legal framework to  the natives were brought to these sites to work in specific plantations or industriesas a gateway to the caribbean hispaniola became a haven for pirates during the early colonial period the western part of the island was settled by french buccaneers among them was bertrand dogeron who succeeded in growing tobacco he recruited many french colonial families from martinique and guadeloupe european nations were competing for control in the new world in the caribbean as well as in north america france and spain settled their hostilities on the island by way of the treaty of ryswick of 1697 and divided hispaniola between themfrance received the western third and subsequently named it saint-domingue the french equivalent of santo domingo the spanish colony of hispaniola and the name of its patron saint saint dominicto develop it into sugarcane plantations the french imported thousands of slaves from africa sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century by 1789 approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in saint-domingue in contrast by 1763 the white population of french canada a vast territory had numbered 65,000 the whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of african slaves they had imported to work on their plantations which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane in the north of the island slaves were able to retain many ties to african cultures religion and language these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported africans blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to onethe french-enacted code noir black code prepared by jean-baptiste colbert and ratified by louis xiv had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms saint-domingue has been described as one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies one-third of newly imported africans died within a few years many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever they had low birth rates and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses rather than give birth to children within the bonds of slaveryas in its louisiana colony the french colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color the mixed-race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves and later mixed-race women over time many were released from slavery they established a separate social class white french creole fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to france for their education some men of color were admitted into the military more of the free people of color lived in the south of the island near port-au-prince and many intermarried within their community they frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen and began to own some property some became slave holders the free people of color petitioned the colonial government to expand their rightsslaves that made it to haiti from the trans-atlantic journey and slaves born in haiti were first documented in haitis archives and transferred to frances ministry of defense and the ministry of foreign affairs as of 2015 these records are in the national archives of france according to the 1788 census haitis population consisted of nearly 25,000 whites 22,000 free coloureds and 700,000 slavesinspired by the french revolution of 1789 and principles of the rights of man free people of color and slaves in saint-domingue and the french west indies pressed for freedom and more civil rights most important was the revolution of the slaves in saint-domingue starting in the northern plains in 1791 where africans greatly outnumbered the whitesin 1792 the french government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control to build an alliance with the gens de couleur and slaves the french commissioners sonthonax and polverel abolished slavery in the colony six months later the national convention led by robespierre and the jacobins endorsed abolition and extended it to all the french coloniespolitical leaders in the united states which was a new republic itself reacted with ambivalence at times providing aid to enable planters to put down the revolt later in the revolution the us provided support to black haitian military forces with the goal of reducing french influence in north america and the caribbeantoussaint louverture a former slave and leader in the slave revolt drove out the spanish from santo domingo and the british invaders who threatened the colony in the uncertain years of revolution the united states played both sides off against each other with its traders supplying both the french and the rebels the struggle within haiti between the free people of color led by andr rigaud and the black haitians led by louverture devolved into the war of the knives in 1799 and 1800 many surviving free people of color left the island as refugeesafter louverture created a separatist constitution napolon bonaparte in 1802 sent an expedition of 20,000 soldiers and as many sailors under the command of his brother-in-law general charles leclerc to retake the island the french achieved some victories but within a few months most of the french had died from yellow fever more than 50,000 french troops died in an attempt to retake the colony including 18 generals the french captured louverture transporting him to france for trial he was imprisoned at fort de joux where he died in 1803 of exposure and possibly tuberculosisthe slaves along with free gens de couleur and allies continued their fight for independence jean-jacques dessalines defeated french troops at the battle of vertires on 18 november 1803 leading the first ever successful slave army revolution in late 1803 france withdrew its remaining 7,000 troops from the island and napoleon gave up his idea of re-establishing a north american empire with the war going badly he sold louisiana new france to the united states in the louisiana purchasethe independence of saint-domingue was proclaimed by dessalines on 1 january 1804 the exact number of deaths due to the haitian revolution is unknowndessalines was proclaimed emperor for life by his troops dessalines at first offered protection to the white planters and others once in power he ordered the massacre of most whites without regard to age or gender those who did not swear allegiance to him were slain in the continuing competition for power he was assassinated by rivals on 17 october 1806only three categories of white people were selected out as exceptions and spared the polish soldiers the majority of whom deserted from the french army and fought alongside the haitian rebels the little group of german colonists invited to the north-west region and a group of medical doctors and professionals reportedly people with connections to officers in the haitian army were also spared as well as the women who agreed to marry non-white menfearful of the influence of the slaves revolution us president thomas jefferson refused to recognize the new republic as did most european nations the us did not officially recognize haiti for decades until after the start of the american civil warthe revolution led to a wave of emigration in 1809 nearly 10,000 refugees from saint-domingue settled en masse in new orleans they doubled the citys population in addition the newly arrived slaves added to the citys african populationsaint-domingue was divided between the kingdom of haiti in the north directed by henri christophe who declared himself henri i and a republic in the south directed by alexandre ption an homme de couleur henri christophe established a semi-feudal corve system with a rigid education and economic codepresident ption gave military and financial assistance to the revolutionary leader simn bolvar which were critical in enabling him to liberate the viceroyalty of new granada he was instrumental in aiding countries in south america achieve independence from spainbeginning in 1821 president jean-pierre boyer also an homme de couleur and successor to ption reunified the two parts of haiti and extended control over the entire western portion of the island in addition after santo domingo declared its independence from spain on 30 november 1821 boyer sent forces in to take control boyer ruled the entire island with iron rule ending slavery in santo domingo after santo domingo achieved independence from haiti it established a separate national identitystruggling to revive the agricultural economy to produce commodity crops boyer passed the code rural which denied peasant laborers the right to leave the land enter the towns or start farms or shops of their own following the revolution many peasants wanted to have their own farms rather than work on plantationsthe american colonization society acs encouraged free blacks in the united states to emigrate to haiti starting in september 1824 more than 6,000 african americans migrated to haiti with transportation paid by the acs many found the conditions too harsh and returned to the united statesin july 1825 king charles x of france during a period of restoration of the monarchy sent a fleet to reconquer the island under pressure president boyer agreed to a treaty by which france formally recognized the independence of the nation in exchange for a payment of 150 million francs by an order of 17 april 1825 the king of france renounced his rights of sovereignty over santo domingo and recognized the independence of haitithough the amount of the reparations was reduced to 90 million in 1838 haiti was unable to finish paying off its debt until 1947 the haitian president would have had little choice as the country unknowingly to him would have been blockaded by french ships if the exchange did not go the french wayafter losing the support of haitis elite boyer was ousted in 1843 a long succession of coups followed his departure to exilethe enforced payment to france reduced haitis economy for years western nations did not give haiti formal diplomatic recognition both of these problems kept the haitian economy and society isolated expatriates bankrolled and armed opposing groupsin 1892 the german government supported suppression of the reform movement of antnor firmin and in 1897 the germans used gunboat diplomacy to intimidate and then humiliate the haitian government during the luders affairin the first decades of the 20th century haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to france germany and the united states fearing possible foreign intervention president woodrow wilson sent us marines into haiti in december 1914 just after the outbreak of world war i they removed 500,000 from the haitian national bank for safe-keeping sic in new york thus giving the united states control of the bankin an expression of the theodore roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine the united states occupied the island in july 1915 after the assassination of haitis president vilbrun guillaume sam the pro-american president had been dragged from the french legation and killed in the street by local insurgents after he had ordered 167 political prisoners killed usswashington under rear admiral caperton arrived in port-au-prince to try to restore order and protect american interests this began a nearly 20-year occupation by us forces within days the marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house which controlled all the finances of the island nation the marines declared martial law and severely censored the press within weeks a new pro-american president philippe sudr dartiguenave had been installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the united states the new constitution included a clause that allowed for the first time foreign ownership of land in haiti which was bitterly opposed by the haitian legislature and citizenrythe next 5 years witnessed numerous cases of intimidation arson torture and murder of the haitian population by us marines and their local enforcers the gendarmerie dhaiti the us marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism allowing them to behave this way mary renda writes that paternalism was an assertion of authority superiority and control expressed in the metaphor of a fathers relationship with his children this mindset allowed the marines to act highly authoritatively in haiti and carry out atrocious acts it has been estimated that up to 15,000 haitians lost their lives at the hands of the occupying forces either through armed opposition or through the corvee system of forced labor this system allowed the occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms at gunpoint if necessary to build roads bridges etc many resisted and were killed on the spot while others died working or due to disease and malnutrition while living in squalid work campsthis chapter in the two nations histories reflects the oppressive foreign policy of the united states toward its neighbors in central america and the caribbean that is often characterized as gunboat diplomacy or one of many banana wars that plagued the region in the early 20th century us marines were stationed in the country until 1934 a period of nineteen years and were finally ordered from the island by franklin d roosevelt as a demonstration of his good neighbor policy however the united states controlled the economy of the island and heavily influenced elections in haiti up through the 1980ssisal was introduced to haiti and sugarcane and cotton became significant exports haitian traditionalists based in rural areas were highly resistant to american-backed changes while the urban elites wanted more control together they helped secure an end to the occupation in 1934 the debts were still outstanding and the american financial advisor-general receiver handled the budget until 1941recognition of the distinctive traditionalism of the haitian people had an influence on united states writers including eugene oneill james weldon johnson langston hughes zora neale hurston and orson wellesafter us forces left in 1934 dominican dictator rafael trujillo used anti-haitian sentiment as a nationalist tool in an event that became known as the parsley massacre he ordered his army to kill haitians living on the dominican side of the border between 10,000 and 20,000 haitians were killed though he was one-quarter haitian himself trujillo continued policies against the neighboring population for some timeon 27 september 1945 haiti became a founding member of the united nations successor to the league of nations in which haiti was also a founding member in the 1950s american and european tourists started to visit haitithe waterfront area of port-au-prince was redeveloped to allow cruise ship passengers to walk from the docks to cultural attractions among these attractions were the moorish-styled iron market where fine haitian art and mahogany were sold in the evenings entrepreneurs provided dancing casino gambling and voodoo shows truman capote and nol coward visited the hotel oloffson a 19th-century gothic gingerbread mansion set in a tropical garden which was even portrayed in the graham greene novel the comediansafter a period of disorder in september 1957 dr franois duvalier was elected president of haiti known as papa doc and initially popular duvalier was president until his death in 1971 he advanced black interests in the public sector where over time people of color had predominated as the educated urban elite he stayed in power by enlisting an organization known as tontons macoutes bogeymen which maintained order by terrorizing the populace and political opponentshaitis brief tourism boom was wiped out by the rule of papa doc duvalier and his unstable government when his son jean-claude baby doc duvalier succeeded him as president for life tourism returned in the 1970s vive la diffrence has long been haitis national tourism slogan and its proximity to the united states made haiti a hot attraction until the duvalier regime was ousted in 1986papa docs son jean-claude duvalier  also known as baby doc  led the country from 1971 until his ouster in 1986 when protests led him to seek exile in france army leader general henri namphy headed a new national governing council general elections in november were aborted after dozens of inhabitants were shot in the capital by soldiers and tontons macoutes fraudulent elections followed the elected president leslie manigat was overthrown some months later in the june 1988 haitian coup dtat the september 1988 haitian coup

catholic priest jean-bertrand aristide was elected president in the haitian general election in september of the following year aristide was overthrown by the military in the 1991 haitian coup dtat in 1994 an american team negotiated the departure of haitis military leaders and the peaceful entry of us forces under operation uphold democracy this enabled the restoration of the democratically elected jean-bertrand aristide as president in october 1994 aristide returned to haiti to complete his term in office aristide vacated the presidency in february 1996 in the 1995 election ren prval was elected as president for a five-year term winning 88% of the popular votein november 1994 hurricane gordon brushed haiti dumping heavy rain and creating flash flooding that triggered mudslides gordon killed an estimated 1,122 people although some estimates go as high as 2,200the november 2000 election returned aristide to the presidency with 92% of the vote the election had been boycotted by the opposition then organized into the convergence dmocratique over a dispute in the may legislative elections in subsequent years there was increasing violence and human rights abuses aristide spent years negotiating with the convergence dmocratique on new elections but the convergences inability to develop a sufficient electoral base made elections unattractivein 2004 a revolt began in northern haiti the rebellion eventually reached the capital and aristide was forced into exile after which the united nations stationed peacekeepers in haiti some including aristide and his bodyguard franz gabriel stated that he was the victim of a new coup dtat or modern kidnapping by us forces mrs aristide stated that the kidnappers wore us special forces uniforms but changed into civilian clothes upon boarding the aircraft that was used to remove aristide from haiti the united nations stabilisation mission minustah was established after the 2004 coup dtat and remains in the country to the present day boniface alexandre assumed interim authority ren prval was elected president in february 2006 following elections marked by uncertainties and popular demonstrationsin 2004 tropical storm jeanne skimmed the north coast of haiti leaving 3,006 people dead in flooding and mudslides mostly in the city of gonaves in 2008 haiti was again struck by tropical storms tropical storm fay hurricane gustav hurricane hanna and hurricane ike all produced heavy winds and rain there were 331 dead and about 800,000 in need of humanitarian aid the state of affairs produced by these storms was intensified by already high food and fuel prices that had caused a food crisis and political unrest in april 2008on 12 january 2010 at 4:53pm local time haiti was struck by a magnitude-7.0 earthquake this was the countrys most severe earthquake in over 200 years the 2010 haiti earthquake was reported to have left up to 316,000 people dead and 1.6 million homeless though later reports found these numbers to have been grossly inflated and put the death toll between 46,000 and 85,000 the country has yet to recover from the 2010 earthquake and a subsequent and massive haiti cholera outbreak that was triggered when cholera-infected waste from a minustah peacekeeping station contaminated the countrys main river the artibonite the country has yet to fully recover due to both the severity of the damage haiti endured in 2010 as well as a government that was ineffective well before the earthquakegeneral elections had been planned for january 2010 but were postponed due to the earthquake the elections were held on 28 november 2010 for the senate the parliament and the first round of the presidential elections the run-off between michel martelly and mirlande manigat took place on 20 march 2011 and preliminary results released on 4 april named michel martelly the winner on 7 february 2016 michel martelly stepped down as president without a successor but only after a deal was reached for a provisional government and leaving prime minister evans paul in power until an interim president is chosen by both chambers of parliamentin 2013 haiti called for european nations to pay reparations for slavery and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings the economist wrote any assistance to the region should be carefully targeted and should surely stem from todays needs not the wrongs of the past the topic however has more than a passing reference to a country that as lord anthony gifford wrote was forced to pay compensation to the government of franceon 4 october 2016 hurricane matthew made landfall near les anglais making it the worst hurricane to strike the nation since hurricane cleo in 1964 the storm brought deadly winds and rain which left haiti with a large amount of damage to be repaired with all of the resources in the country destroyed haiti received aid from the united nations of around us120 million the death total was approximately 3,000 thousands of people were displaced due to damage to infrastructure also the cholera outbreak has been growing since the storm hit haiti with additional flooding after the storm cholera continued to spread beyond the control of officials the storm also caused damage to hospitals and roads which created a larger problem in helping victims and moving resources the devastation and damage that hurricane matthew caused was unpredictable and left haiti in a state of emergencyhaiti is on the western part of hispaniola the second largest island in the greater antilles haiti is the third largest country in the caribbean behind cuba and the dominican republic the latter shares a 360-kilometre 224mi border with haiti haiti at its closest point is about 45 nautical miles 83km 52mi away from cuba and comprises the horseshoe-shape peninsula and because of this it has a disproportionately long coastline and is second in length 1,771km or 1,100mi behind cuba in the greater antilleshaiti is the most mountainous nation in the caribbean and its terrain consists mainly of them interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys the climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude the highest point is pic la selle at 2,680 metres 8,793ftthe northern region consists of the massif du nord northern massif and the plaine du nord northern plain the massif du nord is an extension of the cordillera central in the dominican republic it begins at haitis eastern border north of the guayamouc river and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula the lowlands of the plaine du nord lie along the northern border with the dominican republic between the massif du nord and the north atlantic oceanthe central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges the plateau central central plateau extends along both sides of the guayamouc river south of the massif du nord it runs from the southeast to the northwest to the southwest of the

januaryport-au-prince receives an average annual rainfall of 1,370mm 53.9in there are two rainy seasons apriljune and octobernovember haiti is subject to periodic droughts and floods made more severe by deforestation hurricanes are also a menace in summary haiti is generally a hot and humid tropical climatethere are blind thrust faults associated with the enriquillo-plantain garden fault system over which haiti lies after the earthquake of 2010 there was no evidence of surface rupture and based on seismological geological and ground deformation datathe northern boundary of the fault is where the caribbean tectonic plate shifts eastwards by about 20mm 0.79 inches per year in relation to the north american plate the strike-slip fault system in the region has two branches in haiti the septentrional-oriente fault in the north and the enriquillo-plantain garden fault in the southa 2007 earthquake hazard study noted that the enriquillo-plantain garden fault zone could be at the end of its seismic cycle and concluded that a worst-case forecast would involve a 7.2mw earthquake similar in size to the 1692 jamaica earthquake a study team presented a hazard assessment of the enriquillo-plantain garden fault system to the 18th caribbean geologic conference in march 2008 noting the large strain the team recommended high priority historical geologic rupture studies as the fault was fully locked and had recorded few earthquakes in the preceding 40years an article published in haitis le matin newspaper in september 2008 cited comments by geologist patrick charles to the effect that there was a high risk of major seismic activity in port-au-princehaiti also has rare elements such as gold which can be found at the mont organis gold minethe soil erosion released from the upper catchments and deforestation have caused periodic and severe flooding in haiti as experienced for example on 17 september 2004 earlier in may that year floods had killed over 3,000 people on haitis southern border with the dominican republichaitis forests covered 60 percent of the country as recently as fifty years ago but today according to more in-depth environmental analysis the country yields approximately 30 percent tree cover a stark difference from the often cited 2 percent which has been widely circulated in discourse concerning haitiscientists at the columbia universitys center for international earth science information network ciesin and the united nations environment programme are working on the haiti regenerative initiative an initiative aiming to reduce poverty and natural disaster vulnerability in haiti through ecosystem restoration and sustainable resource managementthe government of haiti is a semi-presidential republic a multiparty system wherein the president of haiti is head of state elected directly by popular elections the prime minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the president chosen from the majority party in the national assembly executive power is exercised by the president and prime minister who together constitute the government in 2013 the annual budget was us1 billionlegislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the national assembly of haiti the government is organized unitarily thus the central government delegates powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent the current structure of haitis political system was set forth in the constitution of haiti on 29 march 1987haitian politics have been contentious since independence haiti has suffered 32 coups haiti is the only country in the western hemisphere to undergo a successful slave revolution but a long history of oppression by dictatorsincluding franois duvalier and his son jean-claude duvalierhas markedly affected the nation france the united states and other western countries have repeatedly intervened in haitian politics since the countrys founding sometimes at the request of one party or another along with international financial institutions they have imposed large quantities of debt haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending there have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on haiti which are considered by some to be detrimental to local industryaccording to a 2006 report by the corruption perceptions index there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty in haiti the nation ranked first of all countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption the international red cross reports that seven out of ten haitians live on less than us2 a daythis statistic was somewhat disputed in a 2006 article about poverty in the slums of haiti written for the red cross wherein icrc officer didier revol wrote such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average haitian and haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily the disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are in the haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question for various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such
