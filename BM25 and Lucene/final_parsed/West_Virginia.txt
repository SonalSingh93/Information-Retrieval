west virginia  wikipedia west virginia  is a state located in the appalachian region of the southern united states it is bordered by virginia to the southeast kentucky to the southwest ohio to the northwest pennsylvania to the north and slightly east and maryland to the northeast west virginia is the 10th smallest by area is ranked 38th in population and has the second lowest household income of the 50 united states the capital and largest city is charlestonwest virginia became a state following the wheeling conventions of 1861 after the american civil war had begun delegates from some unionist counties of northwestern virginia decided to break away from virginia although they included many secessionist counties in the new state west virginia was admitted to the union on june 20 1863 and was a key border state during the war west virginia was the only state to form by separating from a confederate state the first to separate from any state since maine separated from massachusetts and was one of two states admitted to the union during the american civil war the other being nevada while a portion of its residents held slaves most of the residents were yeomen farmers and the delegates provided for gradual abolition of slavery in the new state constitutionthe census bureau and the association of american geographers classify west virginia as part of the southern united states the northern panhandle extends adjacent to pennsylvania and ohio with the west virginia cities of wheeling and weirton just across the border from the pittsburgh metropolitan area while bluefield is less than 70 miles 110km from north carolina huntington in the southwest is close to the states of ohio and kentucky while martinsburg and harpers ferry in the eastern panhandle region are considered part of the washington metropolitan area in between the states of maryland and virginia the unique position of west virginia means that it is often included in several geographical regions including the mid-atlantic the upland south and the southeastern united states it is the only state that is entirely within the area served by the appalachian regional commission the area is commonly defined as appalachiathe state is noted for its mountains and rolling hills its historically significant logging and coal mining industries and its political and labor history it is one of the most densely karstic areas in the world making it a choice area for recreational caving and scientific research the karst lands contribute to much of the states cool trout waters it is also known for a wide range of outdoor recreational opportunities including skiing whitewater rafting fishing hiking backpacking mountain biking rock climbing and huntingmany ancient man-made earthen mounds from various prehistoric mound builder cultures survive especially in the areas of present-day moundsville south charleston and romney the artifacts uncovered in these give evidence of village societies they had a tribal trade system culture that crafted cold-worked copper piecesin the 1670s during the beaver wars the powerful iroquois five allied nations based in present-day new york and pennsylvania drove out other american indian tribes from the region in order to reserve the upper ohio valley as a hunting ground siouan language tribes such as the moneton had previously been recorded in the areaa century later the area now identified as west virginia was contested territory among anglo-americans as well with the colonies of pennsylvania and virginia claiming territorial rights under their colonial charters to this area before the american revolutionary war some speculative land companies such as the vandalia company and later the ohio company and indiana company tried to legitimize their claims to land in parts of west virginia and kentucky but failed with the federal settlement of the pennsylvania and virginia border dispute which resulted in the creation of kentucky kentuckians were satisfied  and the inhabitants of a large part of west virginia were gratefulthe crown considered the area of west virginia to be part of the british virginia colony from 1607 to 1776 the united states considered this area to be the western part of the state of virginia which was commonly referred as trans-allegheny virginia from 1776 to 1863 before the formation of west virginia its residents were discontented for years with their position in virginia as the government was dominated by the planter elite of the tidewater and piedmont areas the legislature had electoral malapportionment based on the counting of slaves toward regional populations and the western white residents were underrepresented in the state legislature more subsistence and yeoman farmers lived in the west and they were generally less supportive of slavery although many counties were divided on their support the residents of this area became more sharply divided after the planter elite of eastern virginia voted to secede from the union during the civil warresidents of the western and northern counties set up a separate government under francis pierpont in 1861 which they called the restored government most voted to separate from virginia and the new state was admitted to the union in 1863 in 1864 a state constitutional convention drafted a constitution which was ratified by the legislature without putting it to popular vote west virginia abolished slavery by a gradual process and temporarily disenfranchised men who had held confederate office or fought for the confederacywest virginias history has been profoundly affected by its mountainous terrain numerous and vast river valleys and rich natural resources these were all factors driving its economy and the lifestyles of its residents who tended to live in many small relatively isolated communities in the mountain valleys geography continues to be important to the statea 2010 analysis of a local stalagmite revealed that native americans were burning forests to clear land as early as 100bc some regional late-prehistoric eastern woodland tribes were more involved in hunting and fishing practicing the slash-and-burn eastern agricultural complex gardening method which used fire to clear out underbrush from certain area another group progressed to the more time-consuming advanced companion crop fields method of gardening also continuing from ancient indigenous people of the state they cultivated tobacco through to early historic times it was used in numerous social and religious ritualsmaize corn did not make a substantial contribution to the diet until after 1150 bp to quote mills osu 2003 eventually tribal villages began depending on corn to feed their turkey flocks as kanawha fort ancients practiced bird husbandry the local indians made corn bread and a flat rye bread called banick as they emerged from the protohistoric era a horizon extending from a little before the early 18th century is sometimes called the acculturating fireside cabin culture trading posts were established by european traders along the potomac and james riverstribes which inhabited west virginia as of the 16th century were the calicua  in the north the susquehannock in the area immediately south of western maryland  the hokan sioux ancestral sioux tribes known as the saponi moneton  tutelo situated east-westtribes which came to inhabit west virginia afterward were the shawnee  kentatentonga iroquois who fractured off of the petun to the north they were also known as the gwiandottein 1671 general abraham wood at the direction of royal governor william berkeley of the virginia colony sent a party from fort henry led by thomas batts and robert fallam to survey this territory they were the first europeans recorded as discovering kanawha falls some sources state that governor alexander spotswoods 1716 knights of the golden horseshoe expedition for which the states golden horseshoe competition for 8th graders was named had penetrated as far as pendleton county however modern historians interpret the original accounts of the excursion as suggesting that none of the expeditions horsemen ventured much farther west of the blue ridge mountains than harrisonburg virginia john van metre an indian trader penetrated into the northern portion in 1725 the same year german settlers from pennsylvania founded new mecklenburg the present shepherdstown on the potomac river and others followedking charles ii of england in 1661 granted to a company of gentlemen the land between the potomac and rappahannock rivers known as the northern neck thomas fairfax 6th lord fairfax of cameron ultimately took possession of this grant and in 1746 a stone was erected at the source of the north branch potomac river to mark the western limit of his grant a considerable part of this land was surveyed by the young george washington between 1748 and 1751 the diary kept by washington recorded that there were already many squatters largely of german origin along the south branch potomac riverchristopher gist a surveyor in the employ of the first ohio company which was composed chiefly of virginians explored the country along the ohio river north of the mouth of the kanawha river between 1751 and 1752 the company sought to have a fourteenth colony established with the name vandalia many settlers crossed the mountains after 1750 though they were hindered by native american resistance few native americans lived permanently within the present limits of the state but the region was a common hunting ground crossed by many trails during the french and indian war the north american front of the seven years war in europe indian allies of the french nearly destroyed the scattered british settlementsshortly before the american revolutionary war in 1774 the crown governor of virginia john murray 4th earl of dunmore led a force over the mountains a body of militia under then-colonel andrew lewis dealt the shawnee indians under hokoleskwa or cornstalk a crushing blow during the battle of point pleasant at the junction of the kanawha and the ohio rivers at the treaty of camp charlotte concluding dunmores war cornstalk agreed to recognize the ohio river as the new boundary with the long knives by 1776 however the shawnee had returned to war joining the chickamauga a band of cherokee known for the area where they lived native american attacks on settlers continued until after the american revolutionary war during the war the settlers in western virginia were generally active whigs and many served in the continental army however claypools rebellion of 17801781 in which a group of men refused to pay taxes imposed by the continental army showed war-weariness in what became west virginiasocial conditions in western virginia were entirely unlike those in the eastern portion of the state the population was not homogeneous as a considerable part of the immigration came by way of pennsylvania and included germans protestant scotch-irish and settlers from the states farther north counties in the east and south were settled mostly by east virginians during the american revolution the movement to create a state beyond the alleghenies was revived and a petition for the establishment of westsylvania was presented to congress on the grounds that the mountains presented an almost impassable barrier to the east the rugged nature of the country made slavery unprofitable and time only increased the social political economic and cultural differences see tuckahoe-cohee between the two sections of virginiaa convention that met in 1829 to form a new constitution for virginia against the protest of the counties beyond the mountains required a property qualification for suffrage this effectively disenfranchised some of the poorer yeoman farmers in addition it gave the slave-holding counties the benefit of three-fifths of their slave population in apportioning the states representation in the us house of representatives as a result every county beyond the alleghenies except one voted to reject the constitution which nevertheless passed because of eastern support the eastern planter elite dominated the legislature and saw to their own intereststhe virginia constitutional convention of 185051 the reform convention addressed a number of issues important to western virginians it extended the vote to all white males 21 years or older the governor lieutenant-governor the judiciary sheriffs and other county officers were to be elected by public vote the composition of the general assembly was changed representation in the house of delegates was apportioned on the basis of the census of 1850 counting whites only the senate representation was arbitrarily fixed at 50 seats with the west receiving twenty and the east thirty senators this was made acceptable to the west by a provision that required the general assembly to reapportion representation on the basis of white population in 1865 or else put the matter to a public referendum but the east also gave itself a tax advantage in requiring a property tax at true and actual value except for slaves slaves under the age of 12 years were not taxed and slaves over that age were taxed at only 300 a fraction of their true value small farmers however had all their assets animals and land taxed at full value despite this tax and the lack of internal improvements in the west the vote was 75,748 for and 11,063 against the new constitution most of the opposition came from delegates from eastern counties who did not like the compromises made for the westgiven these differences many in the west had long contemplated a separate state in particular men such as lawyer francis h pierpont from fairmont had long chafed under the political domination of the tidewater and piedmont slave-holders in addition to differences over the abolition of slavery he and allies felt the virginia government ignored and refused to spend funds on needed internal improvements in the west such as turnpikes and railroadswest virginia was the only state in the union to separate from a confederate state virginia during the american civil war in richmond on april 17 1861 the virginia secession convention of 1861 voted to secede from the union but of the 49 delegates from the northwestern corner which ultimately became west virginia only voted 17 in favor of the ordinance of secession and 30 voted against with 2 abstentions almost immediately after that vote a mass meeting at clarksburg recommended that each county in northwestern virginia send delegates to a convention to meet in wheeling on may 13 1861 when this first wheeling convention met 425 delegates from 25 counties were present though more than one-third of the delegates were from the northern panhandle area but soon there was a division of sentimentsome delegates led by john s carlile favored the immediate formation of a new state while others led by waitman willey argued that as virginias secession had not yet been passed by the required referendum as happened on may 23 such action would constitute revolution against the united states the convention decided that if virginians adopted the secession ordinance of which there was little doubt another convention including the members-elect of the legislature would meet in wheeling in june 1861 on may 23 1861 secession was ratified by a large majority in virginia as a whole but in the western counties 34,677 voted against and 19,121 voted for the ordinancethe second wheeling convention met as agreed on june 11 and declared that since the secession convention had been called without popular consent all its acts were void and that all who adhered to it had vacated their offices the wheeling conventions and the delegates themselves were never actually elected by public ballot to act on behalf of western virginia of its 103 members 33 had been elected to the virginia general assembly on may 23 this included some hold-over state senators whose four-year terms had begun in 1859 and some who vacated their offices to convene in wheeling other members were chosen even more irregularlysome in mass meetings others by county committee and still others were seemingly self-appointed an act for the reorganization of the government was passed on june 19 the next day convention delegates chose francis h pierpont as governor of virginia and elected other officers to a rival state government and two us senators willey and carlile to replace secessionists before adjourning the federal government in washington dc promptly recognized the new government and seated the two new senators thus there were two state governments in virginia one pledging allegiance to the united states and one to the confederacythe second wheeling convention had recessed until august 6 then reassembled on august 20 and called for a popular vote on the formation of a new state and for a convention to frame a constitution if the vote should be favorable at the october 24 1861 election 18,408 votes were cast for the new state and only 781 against the election results were questioned since the union army then occupied the area and union troops were stationed at many of the polls to prevent confederate sympathizers from voting this was also election day for local offices and elections were also held in camps of confederate soldiers who elected rival state officials such as robert e cowan most pro-statehood votes came from 16 counties around the northern panhandle over 50,000 votes had been cast on the ordinance of secession yet the vote on statehood garnered little more than 19,000 in ohio county home to wheeling only about one-quarter of the registered voters cast votes in most of what would become west virginia there was no vote at all since as two-thirds of the territory of west virginia had voted for secession and county officers remained loyal to richmond votes recorded from pro-secession counties were mostly cast elsewhere by unionist refugees from these countiesdespite that controversy delegates including many methodist ministers met to write a new constitution for the new state beginning on november 26 1861 during that constitutional convention a mr lamb of ohio county and a mr carskadon claimed that in hampshire county out of 195 votes only 39 were cast by citizens of the state the rest were cast illegally by union soldiers one of the key figures was rev gordon battelle who also represented ohio county and who proposed resolutions to establish public schools as well as to limit movement of slaves into the new state and to gradually abolish slavery the education proposal succeeded but the convention tabled the slavery proposals before finishing its work on february 18 1862 the new constitution was more closely modeled on that of ohio than of virginia adopting a township model of government rather than the courthouse cliques of virginia which carlile criticized and a compromise demanded by the kanawha region charleston lawyers benjamin smith and brown allowed counties and municipalities to vote subsidies for railroads or other improvement organizations the resulting instrument was ratified 18,162 for and 514 against on april 11 1862on may 13 1862 the state legislature of the reorganized government approved the formation of the new state an application for admission to the union was made to congress introduced by senator waitman willey of the restored government of virginia however sen carlile sought to sabotage the bill first trying to expand the new states boundaries to include the shenandoah valley and then to defeat the willey amendment at home on december 31 1862 an enabling act was approved by president abraham lincoln admitting west virginia on the condition that a provision for the gradual abolition of slavery be inserted in its constitution as rev battelle had urged in the wheeling intelligencer and also written to lincoln while many felt that west virginias admission as a state was both illegal and unconstitutional lincoln issued his opinion on the admission of west virginia finding that the body which consents to the admission of west virginia is the legislature of virginia and that its admission was therefore both constitutional and expedientthe convention was reconvened on february 12 1863 and the abolition demand of the federal enabling act was met the revised constitution was adopted on march 26 1863 and on april 20 1863 president lincoln issued a proclamation admitting the state 60 days later on june 20 1863 meanwhile officers for the new state were chosen while gov pierpont moved his pro-union virginia capital to union-occupied alexandria where he asserted and exercised jurisdiction over all of the remaining virginia counties within the federal linesthe question of the constitutionality of the formation of the new state was later brought before the supreme court of the united states in the following manner berkeley and jefferson counties lying on the potomac east of the mountains in 1863 with the consent of the reorganized government of virginia voted in favor of annexation to west virginiamany voters of the strongly pro-secessionist counties were absent in the confederate army when the vote was taken and refused to acknowledge the transfer when they returned the virginia general assembly repealed the act of secession and in 1866 brought suit against west virginia asking the court to declare the counties a part of virginia which would have declared west virginias admission as a state unconstitutional meanwhile on march 10 1866 congress passed a joint resolution recognizing the transfer the supreme court decided in favor of west virginia in 1870during the civil war union general george b mcclellans forces gained possession of the greater part of the territory in the summer of 1861 culminating at the battle of rich mountain and union control was never again seriously threatened despite an attempt by robert e lee in the same year in 1863 general john d imboden with 5,000 confederates raided a considerable portion of the state and burned pierponts library although senator willey escaped their grasp bands of guerrillas burned and plundered in some sections and were not entirely suppressed until after the war ended the eastern panhandle counties were more affected by the war with military control of the area repeatedly changing handsthe area that became west virginia actually furnished about an equal number of soldiers to the federal and confederate armies approximately 22,00025,000 each in 1865 the wheeling government found it necessary to strip voting rights from returning confederates in order to retain control james ferguson who proposed the law said that if it was not enacted he would lose election by 500 votes the property of confederates might also be confiscated and in 1866 a constitutional amendment disfranchising all who had given aid and comfort to the confederacy was adopted the addition of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the united states constitution caused a reaction the democratic party secured control in 1870 and in 1871 the constitutional amendment of 1866 was abrogated the first steps toward this change had been taken however by the republicans in 1870 on august 22 1872 an entirely new constitution was adoptedbeginning in reconstruction and for several decades thereafter the two states disputed the new states share of the pre-war virginia governments debts which had mostly been incurred to finance public infrastructure improvements such as canals roads and railroads under the virginia board of public works virginiansled by former confederate general william mahoneformed a political coalition based upon this the readjuster party although west virginias first constitution provided for the assumption of a part of the virginia debt negotiations opened by virginia in 1870 were fruitless and in 1871 virginia funded two-thirds of the debt and arbitrarily assigned the remainder to west virginia the issue was finally settled in 1915 when the supreme court of the united states ruled that west virginia owed virginia 12,393,929.50 the final installment of this sum was paid in 1939after reconstruction the new 35th state benefited from the development of its mineral resources more than any other single economic activitysaltpeter caves had been employed throughout appalachia for munitions the border between west virginia and virginia includes the saltpeter trail a string of limestone caverns containing rich deposits of calcium nitrate that were rendered and sold to the government the trail stretched from pendleton county to the western terminus of the route in the town of union monroe county nearly half of these caves are on the west virginia side including organ cave and haynes cave in the late 18th-century saltpeter miners in haynes cave found large animal bones in the deposits these were sent by a local historian and frontier soldier colonel john stuart to thomas jefferson the bones were named megalonyx jeffersonii or great-claw and became known as jeffersons three-toed sloth it was declared the official state fossil of west virginia in 2008 the west virginia official state rock is bituminous coal and the official state gemstone is silicified mississippian fossil lithostrotionella coralthe limestone also produced a useful quarry industry usually small and softer high-calcium seams were burned to produce industrial lime this lime was used for agricultural and construction purposes for many years a specific portion of the c  o railroad carried limestone rock to clifton forge virginia as an industrial fluxsalt mining had been underway since the 18th century though it had largely played out by the time of the american civil war when the red salt of kanawha county was a valued commodity of first confederate and later union forces in years following more sophisticated mining methods would restore west virginias role as a major producer of salthowever in the second half of the 19th century there was an even greater treasure not yet developed bituminous coal it would fuel much of the industrial revolution in the us and the steamships of many of the worlds naviesthe residents both native americans and early european settlers had long known of the underlying coal and that it could be used for heating and fuel however for a long time very small personal mines were the only practical development after the war with the new railroads came a practical method to transport large quantities of coal to expanding us and export markets as the anthracite mines of northwestern new jersey and pennsylvania began to play out during this same time period investors and industrialists focused new interest in west virginia geologists such as dr david t ansted surveyed potential coal fields and invested in land and early mining projectsthe completion of the chesapeake and ohio railway co across the state to the new city of huntington on the ohio river in 1872 opened access to the new river coal field soon the co was building its huge coal pier at newport news virginia on the large harbor of hampton roads in 1881 the new philadelphia-based owners of the former atlantic mississippi and ohio railroad amo which stretched across virginias southern tier from norfolk had sights clearly set on the mountain state where the owners had large land holdings their railroad was renamed norfolk and western nw and a new railroad city was developed at roanoke to handle planned expansion after its new president frederick j kimball and a small party journeyed by horseback and saw firsthand the rich bituminous coal seam which kimballs wife named pocahontas the nw redirected its planned westward expansion to reach it soon the nw was also shipping from new coal piers at hampton roadsin 1889 in the southern part of the state along the norfolk and western rail lines the important coal center of bluefield west virginia was founded the capital of the pocahontas coalfield this city would remain the largest city in the southern portion of the state for several decades it shares a sister city with the same name bluefield in virginiain the northern portion of the state and elsewhere the older baltimore and ohio railroad bo and other lines also expanded to take advantage of coal opportunities the bo developed coal piers in baltimore and at several points on the great lakes other significant rail carriers of coal were the western maryland railway wm southern railway sou and the louisville and nashville railroad lnparticularly notable was a latecomer the virginian railway vgn by 1900 only a large area of the most rugged terrain of southern west virginia was any distance from the existing railroads and mining activity within this area west of the new river coalfield in raleigh and wyoming counties lay the winding gulf coalfield later promoted as the billion dollar coalfielda protg of dr ansted was william nelson page 18541932 a civil engineer and mining manager in fayette county former west virginia governor william a maccorkle described him as a man who knew the land as a farmer knows a field beginning in 1898 page teamed with northern and european-based investors to take advantage of the undeveloped area they acquired large tracts of land in the area and page began the deepwater railway a short-line railroad chartered to stretch between the co at its line along the kanawha river and the nw at matoakaa distance of about 80 miles 130kmalthough the deepwater plan should have provided a competitive shipping market via either railroad leaders of the two large railroads did not appreciate the scheme in secret collusion each declined to negotiate favorable rates with page nor did they offer to purchase his railroad as they had many other short-lines however if the co and nw presidents thought they could thus kill the page project they were to be proved mistaken one of the silent partner investors page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist henry huttleston rogers a principal in john d rockefellers standard oil trust and an old hand at developing natural resources and transportation a master at competitive warfare henry rogers did not like to lose in his endeavors and also had deep pocketsinstead of giving up page and rogers quietly planned and then built their tracks all the way east across virginia using rogers private fortune to finance the 40-million cost when the renamed virginian railway vgn was completed in 1909 no fewer than three railroads were shipping ever-increasing volumes of coal to export from hampton roads west virginia coal was also under high demand at great lakes ports the vgn and the nw ultimately became parts of the modern norfolk southern system and the vgns well-engineered 21st-century tracks continue to offer a favorable gradient to hampton roadsas coal mining and related work became major employment activities in the state there was considerable labor strife as working conditions safety issues and economic concerns arose even in the 21st century mining safety and ecological concerns is still challenging to the state whose coal continues to power electrical generating plants in many other statescoal is not the only valuable mineral found in west virginia as the state was the site of the 1928 discovery of the 34.48 carat 6.896 g jones diamondlocated in the appalachian mountain range west virginia covers an area of 24,229.76 square miles 62,754.8km with 24,077.73 square miles 62,361.0km of land and 152.03 square miles 393.8km of water making it the 41st-largest state in the united states west virginia borders pennsylvania and maryland in the northeast virginia in the southeast ohio in the northwest and kentucky in the southwest its longest border is with virginia at 381 miles followed by ohio at 243 miles maryland at 174 miles pennsylvania at 118 miles and kentucky at 79 mileswest virginia is located entirely within the appalachian region and the state is almost entirely mountainous giving reason to the nickname the mountain state and the motto montani semper liberi mountaineers are always free the elevations and ruggedness drop near large rivers like the ohio river or shenandoah river about 75% of the state is within the cumberland plateau and allegheny plateau regions though the relief is not high the plateau region is extremely rugged in most areas the average elevation of west virginia is approximately 1,500 feet 460m above sea level which is the highest of any us state east of the mississippi riveron the eastern state line with virginia high peaks in the monongahela national forest region give rise to an island of colder climate and ecosystems similar to those of northern new england and eastern canada the highest point in the state is atop spruce knob at 4,863 feet 1,482m and is covered in a boreal forest of dense spruce trees at altitudes above 4,000 feet 1,200m spruce knob lies within the monongahela national forest and is a part of the spruce knob-seneca rocks national recreation area a total of six wilderness areas can also be found within the forest outside the forest to the south the new river gorge is a canyon 1,000 feet 300m deep carved by the new river the national park service manages a portion of the gorge and river that has been designated as the new river gorge national river one of only 15 rivers in the us with this level of protectionother areas under protection and management includemost of west virginia lies within the appalachian mixed mesophytic forests ecoregion while the higher elevations along the eastern border and in the panhandle lie within the appalachian-blue ridge forests the native vegetation for most of the state was originally mixed hardwood forest of oak chestnut maple beech and white pine with willow and american sycamore along the states waterways many of the areas are rich in biodiversity and scenic beauty a fact that is appreciated by native west virginians who refer to their home as almost heaven from the song take me home country roads by john denver before the song it was known as the cog state coal oil and gas or the mountain statethe underlying rock strata are sandstone shale bituminous coal beds and limestone laid down in a near-shore environment from sediments derived from mountains to the east in a shallow inland sea on the west some beds illustrate a coastal swamp environment some river delta some shallow water sea level rose and fell many times during the mississippian and pennsylvanian eras giving a variety of rock strata the appalachian mountains are some of the oldest on earth having formed over 300million years agothe climate of west virginia is generally a humid subtropical climate kppen climate classification cfa except dfb at the higher elevations with warm to hot humid summers and chilly winters increasing in severity with elevation some southern highland areas also have a mountain temperate climate kppen cfb where winter temperatures are more moderate and summer temperatures are somewhat cooler however the weather is subject in all parts of the state to change the hardiness zones range from zone 5b in the central appalachian mountains to zone 7a in the warmest parts of the lowest elevationsin the eastern panhandle and the ohio river valley temperatures are warm enough to see and grow subtropical plants such as southern magnolia magnolia grandiflora crepe myrtle albizia julibrissin american sweetgum and even the occasional needle palm and sabal minor these plants do not thrive as well in other parts of the state the eastern prickly pear grows well in many portions of the stateaverage january temperatures range from around 26f 4c near the cheat river to 41f 5c along sections of the border with kentucky july averages range from 67f 19c along the north branch potomac river to 76f 24c in the western part of the state it is cooler in the mountains than in the lower sections of the state the highest recorded temperature in the state is 112f 44c at martinsburg on july 10 1936 and the lowest recorded temperature in the state is 37f 38c at lewisburg on december 30 1917annual precipitation ranges from less than 32 inches 81cm in the lower eastern section to more than 56 inches 140cm in higher parts of the allegheny front valleys in the east have lower rainfall because the allegheny mountain ridges to the west create a partial rain shadow slightly more than half the rainfall occurs from april to september dense fogs are common in many valleys of the kanawha section especially the tygart valley west virginia is also one of the cloudiest states in the nation with the cities of elkins and beckley ranking 9th and 10th in the us respectively for the number of cloudy days per year over 210 in addition to persistent cloudy skies caused by the damming of moisture by the alleghenies west virginia also experiences some of the most frequent precipitation in the nation with snowshoe averaging nearly 200 days a year with either rain or snow snow usually lasts only a few days in the lower sections but may persist for weeks in the higher mountain areas an average of 34 inches 86cm of snow falls annually in charleston although during the winter of 19951996 more than three times that amount fell as several cities in the state established new records for snowfall average snowfall in the allegheny highlands can range up to 180 inches 460cm per year severe weather is somewhat less prevalent in west virginia than in most other eastern states and it ranks among the least tornado-prone states east of the rockiesthe united states census bureau estimates that the population of west virginia was 1,831,102 on july 1 2016 a 1.2% decrease since the 2010 united states census the center of population of west virginia is located in braxton county in the town of gassawayat the 2010 census the racial composition of the states population wasin the same year 1.2% of west virginias population was of hispanic latino or spanish origin they may be of any raceas of 2012 west virginia has an estimated population of 1,855,413 which is an increase of 49 or 0.0% from the prior year and an increase of 2,414 or 0.13% since the year 2000 this includes a natural decrease since the last
