pre-existing settlements of georgetown and alexandria named in honor of president george washington the city of washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital in 1846 congress returned the land originally ceded by virginia in 1871 it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the districtwashington had an estimated population of 681,170 as of july

to the house of representatives but the district has no representation in the senate the district receives three electoral votes in presidential elections as permitted by the twenty-third amendment to the united states constitution ratified in 1961various tribes of the algonquian-speaking piscataway people also known as the conoy inhabited the lands around the potomac river when europeans first visited the area in the early 17th century one group known as the nacotchtank also called the nacostines by catholic missionaries maintained settlements around the anacostia river within the present-day district of columbia conflicts with european colonists and neighboring tribes forced the relocation of the piscataway people some of whom established a new settlement in 1699 near point of rocks marylandin his federalist no 43 published january 23 1788 james madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety five years earlier a band of unpaid soldiers besieged congress while its members were meeting in philadelphia known as the pennsylvania mutiny of 1783 the event emphasized the need for the national government not to rely on any state for its own securityarticle one section eight of the constitution permits the establishment of a district not exceeding tenmilessquare as may by cession of particular states and the acceptance of congress become the seat of the government of the united states however the constitution does not specify a location for the capital in what is now known as the compromise of 1790 madison alexander hamilton and thomas jefferson came to an agreement that the federal government would pay each states remaining revolutionary war debts in exchange for establishing the new national capital in the southern united stateson july 9 1790 congress passed the residence act which approved the creation of a national capital on the potomac river the exact location was to be selected by president george washington who signed the bill into law on july 16 formed from land donated by the states of maryland and virginia the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles 16km on each side totaling 100 square miles 259kmtwo pre-existing settlements were included in the territory the port of georgetown maryland founded in 1751 and the city of alexandria virginia founded in 1749 during 179192 andrew ellicott and several assistants including a free african american astronomer named benjamin banneker surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point many of the stones are still standinga new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the potomac to the east of georgetown on september 9 1791 the three commissioners overseeing the capitals construction named the city in honor of president washington the federal district was named columbia which was a poetic name for the united states commonly in use at that time congress held its first session in washington on november 17 1800congress passed the organic act of 1801 which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government further the unincorporated area within the district was organized into two counties the county of washington to the east of the potomac and the county of alexandria to the west after the passage of this act citizens living in the district were no longer considered residents of maryland or virginia which therefore ended their representation in congresson august 2425 1814 in a raid known as the burning of washington british forces invaded the capital during the war of 1812 the capitol treasury and white house were burned and gutted during the attack most government buildings were repaired quickly however the capitol was largely under construction at the time and was not completed in its current form until 1868in the 1830s the districts southern territory of alexandria went into economic decline partly due to neglect by congress the city of alexandria was a major market in the american slave trade and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in congress would end slavery in the district further depressing the economy alexandrias citizens petitioned virginia to take back the land it had donated to form the district through a process known as retrocessionthe virginia general assembly voted in february 1846 to accept the return of alexandria and on july 9 1846 congress agreed to return all the territory that had been ceded by virginia therefore the districts current area consists only of the portion originally donated by maryland confirming the fears of pro-slavery alexandrians the compromise of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the district although not slavery itselfthe outbreak of the american civil war in 1861 led to expansion of the federal government and notable growth in the districts population including a large influx of freed slaves president abraham lincoln signed the compensated emancipation act in 1862 which ended slavery in the district of columbia and freed about 3,100 enslaved persons nine months prior to the emancipation proclamation in 1868 congress granted the districts african american male residents the right to vote in municipal electionsby 1870 the districts population had grown 75% from the previous census to nearly 132,000 residents despite the citys growth washington still had dirt roads and lacked basic sanitation some members of congress suggested moving the capital further west but president ulysses s grant refused to consider such a proposalcongress passed the organic act of 1871 which repealed the individual charters of the cities of washington and georgetown and created a new territorial government for the whole district of columbia president grant appointed alexander robey shepherd to the position of governor in 1873 shepherd authorized large-scale projects that greatly modernized washington but ultimately bankrupted the district government in 1874 congress replaced the territorial government with an appointed three-member board of commissionersthe citys first motorized streetcars began service in 1888 and generated growth in areas of the district beyond the city of washingtons original boundaries

city in 1791 president washington commissioned pierre peter charles lenfant a french-born architect and city planner to design the new capital he enlisted scottish surveyor alexander ralston helped layout the city plan the lenfant plan featured broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles providing room for open space and landscaping he based his design on plans of cities such as paris amsterdam karlsruhe and milan that thomas jefferson had sent to him lenfants design also envisioned a garden-lined grand avenue approximately 1 mile 1.6km in length and 400 feet 120m wide in the area that is now the national mallpresident washington dismissed lenfant in march 1792 due to conflicts with the three commissioners appointed to supervise the capitals construction andrew ellicott who had worked with lenfant surveying the city was then tasked with completing the design though ellicott made revisions to the original plans including changes to some street patterns lenfant is still credited with the overall design of the cityby the early 1900s lenfants vision of a grand national capital had become marred by slums and randomly placed buildings including a railroad station on the national mall congress formed a special committee charged with beautifying washingtons ceremonial core what became known as the mcmillan plan was finalized in 1901 and included re-landscaping the capitol grounds and the national mall clearing slums and establishing a new citywide park system the plan is thought to have largely preserved lenfants intended designby law washingtons skyline is
