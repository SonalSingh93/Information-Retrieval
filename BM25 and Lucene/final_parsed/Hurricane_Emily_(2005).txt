hurricane emily  2005   wikipedia hurricane emily was the earliest forming category 5 atlantic hurricane on record in a season and the most intense to form before august a powerful early season and cape verde-type tropical cyclone that caused significant damage across the caribbean sea to mexico the storm formed on july10 2005 in the central atlantic ocean before passing through the windward islands on july14 tracking generally towards the west-northwest the storm gradually intensified as it traversed the caribbean peaking as a category5 hurricane on july16 marking the earliest date for a storm to do so during the course of a given year the system subsequently made landfall in the yucatn peninsula as a category4 quickly crossing the peninsula emily emerged into the gulf of mexico and reorganized on july20 the storm struck tamaulipas as a major hurricane and rapidly dissipated within 24hours the storm caused significant damage along its path with up to 1.01 billion 2005 usd in damages recorded as well as causing 17 fatalitieson july 6 a tropical wave moved off the coast of africa moving westward the disturbance gradually organized until july10 at which point convection became more concentrated and it is estimated tropical depression five formed in the central tropical atlantic that evening late on july11 it strengthened and was named tropical storm emily initially forecast to strengthen rapidly and move west-northwest through the greater antilles emily instead moved almost due west toward the windward islands remaining a moderate tropical storm the storm languished while moving quickly west and struggled with maintaining its form contrary to the normal occurrence that hurricanes leave a cold wake behind hurricane dennis had made portions of the caribbean sea warmer and therefore more favorable for tropical cyclone development late on july13 emily strengthened rapidly and reached hurricane strength while passing tobago and entering the eastern caribbean on july14 emily made landfall in northern grenada with 90mph 145kmh windsthe intensification trend picked up again the next day with a fairly rapid drop in the storms central pressure as it entered the southeastern caribbean sea a region typically unfavorable for intensification hurricane emilys winds increased in reaction briefly bringing the storm to category 4 strength early on july15 during the day the storms strength fluctuated greatly dropping to a category2 storm and then rebuilding to category4 on july16 emily strengthened considerably making it the strongest hurricane ever on record to form in the month of july with peak winds of 160mph 260kmh the earliest known category 5 in the atlantic basin initially at this point emily was thought to have peaked as a category4 storm but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a category5 hurricane the storm weakened slightly as it continued westward and remained a category4 while passing south of jamaica and on july17 the cayman islands hurricane emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest weakening somewhat but remaining at category4 until striking cozumel just before mainland landfall at playa del carmen at 06:30utc on july18 sustained winds were 135mph 215kmh and the eyewall passed directly over cozumelthe center of circulation emerged over the gulf of mexico later that morning passage over land disrupted the hurricanes center of circulation and it had weakened to a minimal hurricane with wind speeds of 75mph 120kmh however several hours over the warm waters of the western gulf provided the energy needed for emily to regenerate and by midnight wind speeds were increasing the increase in wind speed stalled but the storm continued to become better organized emily started to show very symmetrical outflow but the hurricanes strongest winds were being found at three different distances from the center however the outer wind radii subsided in the end and the inner core prevailed the result was a rapid strengthening of the inner core on the evening of july19 the pressure dropped about 30millibars and the winds went from 90mph 145kmh to more than 125mph 200kmh all within a few hoursfurther strengthening was expected by forecasters but did not come the storms motion slowed and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast the storm made landfall around 11:00utc on july20 near san fernando in tamaulipas the storm had sustained winds of 125mph 200kmh category3 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale after heading inland over northeast mexico it
