hurricane dean  wikipedia hurricane dean was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2007 atlantic hurricane season it was the most intense north atlantic hurricane since hurricane wilma of 2005 tying for seventh overall additionally it made the third most intense atlantic hurricane landfall a cape verde-type hurricane that formed on august 13 2007 dean took a west-northwest path from the eastern atlantic ocean through the saint lucia channel and into the caribbean it strengthened into a major hurricane reaching category5 status on the saffirsimpson hurricane wind scale before passing just south of jamaica on august 20 the storm made landfall on the yucatn peninsula on august21 as a powerful category5 storm it crossed the peninsula and emerged into the bay of campeche weakened but still a hurricane it strengthened briefly before making a second landfall near tecolutla in the mexican state of veracruz on august 22 dean drifted to the northwest weakening into a remnant low which dissipated uneventfully over the southwestern united states dean was the second-most intense tropical cyclone worldwide of 2007 in terms of pressure only behind cyclone george in the australian region and tied with felix as the most intense worldwide in terms of 1-minute sustained windsthe hurricanes intense winds waves rains and storm surge were responsible for at least 45deaths across ten countries and caused estimated damages of us1.66billion first impacting the islands of the lesser antilles deans path through the caribbean devastated agricultural crops particularly those of martinique and jamaica upon reaching mexico hurricane dean was a category5 storm but it missed major population centers and its exceptional category5 strength landfall caused no deaths and less damage than in the caribbean islands it passed as a category2 stormthrough the affected regions clean up and repair took months to complete donations solicited by international aid organizations joined national funds in clearing roads rebuilding houses and replanting destroyed crops in jamaica where the damage was worst banana production did not return to pre-storm levels for over a year mexicos tourist industry too took almost a year to rebuild its damaged cruise ship infrastructuredean was the first hurricane to make landfall in the atlantic basin at category5 intensity since hurricane andrew on august 24 1992 deans category5 landfall was in a sparsely populated area and thus far less damaging than andrews even though dean was much larger but its long swath of damage resulted in its name retirement from the world meteorological organizations atlantic hurricane naming listson august 11 2007 a tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa and encountering favorable conditions quickly developed into tropical depression four about 520miles 835km west-southwest of cape verde on august 13 the depression moved briskly westward and was upgraded to tropical storm dean at 1500utc on august 14 the storms intensity continued to build although dry air and cooler air inflow from the north were slowing structural development ragged bands formed on august 15 and the formation of a partial eyewall was observed later that dayintensification continued and the storm was upgraded to hurricane dean at 5am edt 0900 utc august 16 the deep-layered ridge to the north continued to steer the system west towards the caribbean sea the storm quickly strengthened to a category2 hurricane on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale the storms development slowed slightly but a reconnaissance aircraft discovered a closed eyewall on august 17 as the storm passed through the lesser antilles data from the aircraft indicated that hurricane dean had strengthened to a category3 hurricane and its trailing bands were still over the lesser antilles during the evening of august 17 dean strengthened into a category4 hurricane and continued to steadily grow in both size and intensity through the night on august 18 the presence of a double eyewall was noted indicating an eyewall replacement cycle and causing short term fluctuations in intensity these fluctuations did not affect the storms well defined satellite presentation operationally dean was thought to have only been a category4 on the 18th but post-storm analysis shows that dean had become a 165miles per hour 265kmh category5 that day dean weakened very slightly on the morning of august 19 as it finished the eyewall replacement cycle and began to interact with the island of jamaicahurricane dean passed south of jamaica on the evening of august 19 and began to intensify again that night its eyewall replacement cycle was thought to be completed a concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of august 20 but did not last long the hurricane still tracking west-northwest under the influence of a strengthening deep-layered high pressure system to the north moved over waters with extremely high heat content and began to strengthen once again the eyewall became even better defined during the day and at 8:35pm ast on august 20 0035 august 21 utc dean restrengthened to a category 5 hurricane the highest rating on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale it made landfall as a category5 storm in quintana roos costa maya region 40mi 65km northeast of the border between mexico and belize and weakened on its way over land reemerging on the western side of yucatn as a category1 storm dean regained strength as it crossed the gulf of mexico and made its second landfall as a category2 storm on august 22 at around 11:30 cdt near tecolutla veracruz to the south of tuxpan where after it moved westward losing strength and disintegrating over central mexico a small remnant circulation reached the pacific ocean eventually moving northwestward around an anticyclone roughly parallel to the mexican coast and finally back inland over the southwestern united states where it completely dissipated on august 27hurricane deans smooth and well-predicted track gave unusually advance warning to all of the nations in its path and allowed them time to prepare for the storms impact because of the advance warning and deans extraordinary strength the nations of central america and the caribbean set up hundreds of shelters readied thousands of disaster recovery experts evacuated hundreds of thousands of vulnerable residents and prepared millions of dollars of emergency suppliesas hurricane dean approached the lesser antilles the local meteorological services issued watches and warnings advising residents to prepare for the storm hurricane warnings were issued for st lucia dominica martinique and guadeloupe and its dependencies hurricane watches were issued for saba and st eustatius tropical

reported on the beaches of florida one person drowned and at least 35people had to be rescued from the turbulent waters at siesta key caused by hurricane dean rough seas produced by dean caused minor flooding in dauphin island alabama damages from the flooding amounted to 100,000 the remnant circulation of dean after lingering off the pacific coast moved inland by santa barbara california and brought heavy thunderstorms and localized flooding to coastal southern california on the morning of august 26 the remnants crossed the mojave desert on the morning of august 27 las vegas received a daily record of 0.58in 15mm of rain with flash flooding and minor damagedespite deans significant damage it did not have severe effects on infrastructure and the non-agricultural sectors of most affected nations recovered quickly most cruise lines diverted their ships away from the western caribbean in anticipation of hurricane deans passage though by august 27 all were back on schedule except those with damaged ports in belize and the yucatn the lesser antilles and the greater antilles were especially quick to resume servicing cruise lines as their ports opened within daysalthough hurricane dean was only a category2 hurricane when its northern eyewall passed over martinique the wind and widespread flooding destroyed 70% of the islands sugar cane crop and all of its banana crop valued at 400million  or 10% of gdp remarkably the tourism industry withstood the storm well only a few hotels reported minor damage and the airport opened the day after the hurricane other than landscaping damage all of the islands hotels were fully functional by the end of augustthe french overseas minister christian estrozy and french prime minister francois fillon visited french caribbean island to assess the storms damage they estimated the storm left 600people homeless the brevity of their visit prompted some of martiniques famous writers including edouard glissant patrick chamoiseau and raphael confiant to write an open letter airing their grievances concerning french politics and the handling of hurricane deans impactfrancois fillon then visited guadaloupe and brought with him a team of experts from the ministry of the interior to assess the nature and cost of the damage the local government reported to them that 75% of guadeloupes banana plantations valued at 100million were totally destroyed despite promises by overseas minister christian estrosi that all problems would be resolved within three months it took over six months to restart banana production and several more to restore lost capacity other than the crop damage the island suffered only minor wind and flooding damage both of which were quickly repairedon august 24 jamaican prime minister portia simpson

well-predicted track gave ample warning the storm inflicted extreme damage in majahual the only town to experience the full force of the hurricane hundreds of buildings were destroyed quintana roo governor flix gonzlez canto reported that although the cleanup in the state capital of chetumal was completed within three weeks it took more than six months to fix all of the regions more rural roads
