latitude  wikipedia in geography latitude is a geographic coordinate that specifies the northsouth position of a point on the earths surface latitude is an angle defined below which ranges from 0 at the equator to 90 north or south at the poles lines of constant latitude or parallels run eastwest as circles parallel to the equator latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the earth without qualification the term latitude should be taken to be the geodetic latitude as defined in the following sections also defined are six auxiliary latitudes which are used in special applicationstwo levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of latitude and longitude in the first step the physical surface is modeled by the geoid a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses the second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface the simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere but the geoid is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid the definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface the latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the iso 19111 standardsince there are many different reference ellipsoids the precise latitude of a feature on the surface is not unique this is stressed in the iso standard which states that without the full specification of the coordinate reference system coordinates that is latitude and longitude are ambiguous at best and meaningless at worst this is of great importance in accurate applications such as a global positioning system gps but in common usage where high accuracy is not required the reference ellipsoid is not usually statedin english texts the latitude angle defined below is usually denoted by the greek lower-case letter phi  or  it is measured in degrees minutes and seconds or decimal degrees north or south of the equatorthe precise measurement of latitude requires an understanding of the gravitational field of the earth either to set up theodolites or to determine gps satellite orbits the study of the figure of the earth together with its gravitational field is the science of geodesythis article relates to coordinate systems for the earth it may be extended to cover the moon planets and other celestial objects by a simple change of nomenclaturethe graticule is formed by the lines of constant latitude and constant longitude which are constructed with reference to the rotation axis of the earth the primary reference points are the poles where the axis of rotation of the earth intersects the reference surface planes which contain the rotation axis intersect the surface at the meridians and the angle between any one meridian plane and that through greenwich the prime meridian defines the longitude meridians are lines of constant longitude the plane through the centre of the earth and perpendicular to the rotation axis intersects the surface at a great circle called the equator planes parallel to the equatorial plane intersect the surface in circles of constant latitude these are the parallels the equator has a latitude of 0 the north pole has a latitude of 90 north written 90n or 90 and the south pole has a latitude of 90 south written 90s or 90 the latitude of an arbitrary point is the angle between the equatorial plane and the normal to the surface at that point the normal to the surface of the sphere is along the radius vectorthe latitude as defined in this way for the sphere is often termed the spherical latitude to avoid ambiguity with the geodetic latitude and the auxiliary latitudes defined in subsequent sections of this articlebesides the equator four other parallels are of significancethe plane of the earths orbit about the sun is called the ecliptic and the plane perpendicular to the rotation axis of the earth is the equatorial plane the angle between the ecliptic and the equatorial plane is called variously the axial tilt the obliquity or the inclination of the ecliptic and it is conventionally denoted by  the latitude of the tropical circles is equal to  and the latitude of the polar circles is its complement 90 - i the axis of rotation varies slowly over time and the values given here are those for the current epoch the time variation is discussed more fully in the article on axial tiltthe figure shows the geometry of a cross-section of the plane perpendicular to the ecliptic and through the centres of the earth and the sun at the december solstice when the sun is overhead at some point of the tropic of capricorn the south polar latitudes below the antarctic circle are in daylight whilst the north polar latitudes above the arctic circle are in night the situation is reversed at the june solstice when the sun is overhead at the tropic of cancer only at latitudes in between the two tropics is it possible for the sun to be directly overhead at the zenithon map projections there is no universal rule as to how meridians and parallels should appear the examples below show the named parallels as red lines on the commonly used mercator projection and the transverse mercator projection on the former the parallels are horizontal and the meridians are vertical whereas on the latter there is no exact relationship of parallels and meridians with horizontal and vertical both are complicated curveson the sphere the normal passes through the centre and the latitude  is therefore equal to the angle subtended at the centre by the meridian arc from the equator to the point concerned if the meridian distance is denoted by  thenwhere  denotes the mean radius of the earth  is equal to 6,371km or 3,959 miles no higher accuracy is appropriate for  since higher-precision results necessitate an ellipsoid model with this value for  the meridian length of 1 degree of latitude on the sphere is 111.2km or 69.1 miles the length of 1 minute of latitude is 1.853km or 1.151 miles and this distance was formerly used as the basis of the nautical milein 1687 isaac newton published the philosophi naturalis principia mathematica in which he proved that a rotating self-gravitating fluid body in equilibrium takes the form of an oblate ellipsoid this article uses the term ellipsoid in preference to the older term spheroid newtons result was confirmed by geodetic measurements in the 18th century see meridian arc an oblate ellipsoid is the three-dimensional surface generated by the rotation of an ellipse about its shorter axis minor axis oblate ellipsoid of revolution is abbreviated to ellipsoid in the remainder of this article ellipsoids which do not have an axis of symmetry are termed triaxialmany different reference ellipsoids have been used in the history of geodesy in pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but with the advent of gps it has become natural to use reference ellipsoids such as wgs84 with centre at the centre of mass of the earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the earth these geocentric ellipsoids are usually within 100m 330ft of the geoid since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another gps handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link wgs84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated gridthe shape of an ellipsoid of revolution is determined by the shape of the ellipse which is rotated about its minor shorter axis two parameters are required one is invariably the equatorial radius which is the semi-major axis  the other parameter is usually 1the polar radius or semi-minor axis  or 2the first flattening  or 3the eccentricity  these parameters are not independent they are related bymany other parameters see ellipse ellipsoid appear in the study of geodesy geophysics and map projections but they can all be expressed in terms of one or two members of the set    and  both  and  are small and often appear in series expansions in calculations they are of the order  and 0.08 respectively values for a number of ellipsoids are given in figure of the earth reference ellipsoids are usually defined by the semi-major axis and the inverse flattening  for example the defining values for the wgs84 ellipsoid used by all gps devices arefrom which are derivedthe difference between the semi-major and semi-minor axes is about 21km 13 miles and as fraction of the semi-major axis it equals the flattening on a computer monitor the ellipsoid could be sized as 300 by 299 pixels this would barely be distinguishable from a 300-by-300-pixel sphere so illustrations usually exaggerate the flatteningthe graticule on the ellipsoid is constructed in exactly the same way as on the sphere the normal at a point on the surface of an ellipsoid does not pass through the centre except for points on the equator or at the poles but the definition of latitude remains unchanged as the angle between the normal and the equatorial plane the terminology for latitude must be made more precise by distinguishingthe importance of specifying the reference datum may be illustrated by a simple example on the reference ellipsoid for wgs84 the centre of the eiffel tower has a geodetic latitude of 485129n or 48.8583n and longitude of 21740e or 2.2944e the same coordinates on the datum ed50 define a point on the ground which is 140 metres 460 feet distant from the tower a web search may produce several different values for the latitude of the tower the reference ellipsoid is rarely specifiedin meridian arc and standard texts it is shown that the distance along a meridian from latitude  to the equator is given by  in radianswhere  is the meridional radius of curvaturethe distance from the equator to the pole isfor wgs84 this distance is the evaluation of the meridian distance integral is central to many studies in geodesy and map projection it can be evaluated by expanding the integral by the binomial series and integrating term by term see meridian arc for details the length of the meridian arc between two given latitudes is given by replacing the limits of the integral by the latitudes concerned the length of a small meridian arc is given bywhen the latitude difference is 1 degree corresponding to  radians the arc distance is aboutthe distance in metres correct to 0.01 metre between latitudes 0.5 degrees and 0.5 degrees on the wgs84 spheroid isthe variation of this distance with latitude on wgs84 is shown in the table along with the length of a degree of longitude east-west distancea calculator for any latitude is provided by the us governments national geospatial-intelligence agency ngahistorically a nautical mile was defined as the length of one minute of arc along a meridian of a spherical earth an ellipsoid model leads to a variation of the nautical mile with latitude this was resolved by defining the nautical mile to be exactly 1,852 metresthere are six auxiliary latitudes that have applications to special problems in geodesy geophysics and the theory of map projectionsthe definitions given in this section all relate to locations on the reference ellipsoid but the first two auxiliary latitudes like the geodetic latitude can be extended to define a three-dimensional geographic coordinate system as discussed below the remaining latitudes are not used in this way they are used only as intermediate constructs in map projections of the reference ellipsoid to the plane or in calculations of geodesics on the ellipsoid their numerical values are not of interest for example no one would need to calculate the authalic latitude of the eiffel towerthe expressions below give the auxiliary latitudes in terms of the geodetic latitude the semi-major axis  and the eccentricity  for inverses see below the forms given are apart from notational variants those in the standard reference for map projections namely map projections a working manual by j p snyder derivations of these expressions may be found in adams and online publications by osborne and rappthe geocentric latitude is the angle between the equatorial plane and the radius from the centre to a point on the surface the relation between the geocentric latitude  and the geodetic latitude  is derived in the above references asthe geodetic and geocentric latitudes are equal at the equator and at the poles but at other latitudes they differ by a few minutes of arc taking the value of the squared eccentricity as 0.0067 it depends on the choice of ellipsoid the maximum difference of  may be shown to be about 11.5 minutes of arc at a geodetic latitude of approximately 456the reduced or parametric latitude  is defined by the radius drawn from the centre of the ellipsoid to that point  on the surrounding sphere of radius  which is the projection parallel to the earths axis of a point  on the ellipsoid at latitude  it was introduced by legendre and bessel who solved problems for geodesics on the ellipsoid by transforming them to an equivalent problem for spherical geodesics by using this smaller latitude bessels notation  is also used in the current literature the reduced latitude is related to the geodetic latitude bythe alternative name arises from the parameterization of the equation of the ellipse describing a meridian section in terms of cartesian coordinates  the distance from the minor axis and  the distance above the equatorial plane the equation of the ellipse isthe cartesian coordinates of the point are parameterized bycayley suggested the term parametric latitude because of the form of these equationsthe reduced latitude is not used in the theory of map projections its most important application is in the theory of ellipsoid geodesics vincenty karneythe rectifying latitude  is the meridian distance scaled so that its value at the poles is equal to 90 degrees or  radianswhere the meridian distance from the equator to a latitude  is see meridian arcand the length of the meridian quadrant from the equator to the pole the polar distance isusing the rectifying latitude to define a latitude on a sphere of radiusdefines a projection from the ellipsoid to the sphere such that all meridians have true length and uniform scale the sphere may then be projected to the plane with an equirectangular projection to give a double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane such that all meridians have true length and uniform meridian scale an example of the use of the rectifying latitude is the equidistant conic projection snyder section 16 the rectifying latitude is also of great importance in the construction of the transverse mercator projectionthe authalic greek for same area latitude  gives an area-preserving transformation to a spherewhereandand the radius of the sphere is taken asan example of the use of the authalic latitude is the albers equal-area conic projectionthe conformal latitude  gives an angle-preserving conformal transformation to the spherewhere  is the gudermannian function see also mercator projection the conformal latitude defines a transformation from the ellipsoid to a sphere of arbitrary radius such that the angle of intersection between any two lines on the ellipsoid is the same as the corresponding angle on the sphere so that the shape of small elements is well preserved a further conformal transformation from the sphere to the plane gives a conformal double projection from the ellipsoid to the plane this is not the only way of generating such a conformal projection for example the exact version of the transverse mercator projection on the ellipsoid is not a double projection it does however involve a generalisation of the conformal latitude to the complex planethe isometric latitude is conventionally denoted by  not to be confused with the geocentric latitude it is used in the development of the ellipsoidal versions of the normal mercator projection and the transverse mercator projection the name isometric arises from the fact that at any point on the ellipsoid equal increments of  and longitude  give rise to equal distance displacements along the meridians and parallels respectively the graticule defined by the lines of constant  and constant  divides the surface of the ellipsoid into a mesh of squares of varying size the isometric latitude is zero at the equator but rapidly diverges from the geodetic latitude tending to infinity at the poles the conventional notation is given in snyder page 15for the normal mercator projection on the ellipsoid this function defines the spacing of the parallels if the length of the equator on the projection is  units of length or pixels then the distance  of a parallel of latitude  from the equator isthe isometric latitude  is closely related to the conformal latitude the formulae in the previous sections give the auxiliary latitude in terms of the geodetic latitude the expressions for the geocentric and reduced latitudes may be inverted directly but this is impossible in the four remaining cases the rectifying authalic conformal and isometric latitudes there are two methods of proceeding the first is a numerical inversion of the defining equation for each and every particular value of the auxiliary latitude the methods available are fixed-point iteration and newtonraphson root finding the other more useful approach is to express the auxiliary latitude as a series in terms of the geodetic latitude and then invert the series by the method of lagrange reversion such series are presented by adams who uses taylor series expansions and gives coefficients in terms of the eccentricity osborne derives series to arbitrary order by using the computer algebra package maxima and expresses the coefficients in terms of both eccentricity and flattening the series method is not applicable to the isometric latitude and one must use the conformal latitude in an intermediate stepthe following plot shows the magnitude of the difference between the geodetic latitude denoted as the common latitude on the plot and the auxiliary latitudes other than the isometric latitude which diverges to infinity at the poles in every case the geodetic latitude is the greater the differences shown on the plot are in arc minutes the horizontal resolution of the plot fails to make clear that the maxima of the curves are not at 45 but calculation shows that they are within a few arc minutes of 45 some representative data points are given in the table following the plot note the closeness of the conformal and geocentric latitudes this was exploited in the days of hand calculators to expedite the construction of map projectionsthe geodetic latitude or any of the auxiliary latitudes defined on the reference ellipsoid constitutes with longitude a two-dimensional coordinate system on that ellipsoid to define the position of an arbitrary point it is necessary to extend such a coordinate system into three dimensions three latitudes are used in this way the geodetic geocentric and reduced latitudes are used in geodetic coordinates spherical polar coordinates and ellipsoidal coordinates respectivelyat an arbitrary point  consider the line  which is normal to the reference ellipsoid the geodetic coordinates  are the latitude and longitude of the point  on the ellipsoid and the distance  this height differs from the height above the geoid or a reference height such as that above mean sea level at a specified location the direction of  will also differ from the direction of a vertical plumb line the relation of these different heights requires knowledge of the shape of the geoid and also the gravity field of the earththe geocentric latitude  is the complement of the polar angle  in conventional spherical polar coordinates in which the coordinates of a point are  where  is the distance of  from the centre   is the angle between the radius vector and the polar axis and  is longitude since the normal at a general point on the ellipsoid does not pass through the centre it is clear that points on the normal which all have the same geodetic latitude will have differing geocentric latitudes spherical polar coordinate systems are used in the analysis of the gravity fieldthe reduced latitude can also be extended to a three-dimensional coordinate system for a point  not on the reference ellipsoid semi-axes  and  construct an auxiliary ellipsoid which is confocal same foci   with the reference ellipsoid the necessary condition is that the product  of semi-major axis and eccentricity is the same for both ellipsoids let  be the semi-minor axis  of the auxiliary ellipsoid further let  be the reduced latitude of  on the auxiliary ellipsoid the set  define the ellipsoid coordinates these coordinates are the natural choice in models of the gravity field for a uniform distribution of mass bounded by the reference ellipsoidthe relations between the above coordinate systems and also cartesian coordinates are not presented here the transformation between geodetic and cartesian coordinates may be found in geographic coordinate conversion the relation of cartesian and spherical polars is given in spherical coordinate system the relation of cartesian and ellipsoidal coordinates is discussed in torgeastronomical latitude  is the angle between the equatorial plane and the true vertical at a point on the surface the true vertical the direction of a plumb line is also the direction of the gravity acceleration the resultant of the gravitational acceleration mass-based and the centrifugal acceleration at that latitude astronomic latitude is calculated from angles measured between the zenith and stars whose declination is accurately knownin general the true vertical at a point on the surface does not exactly coincide with either the normal to the reference ellipsoid or the normal to the geoid the angle between the astronomic and geodetic normals is usually a few seconds of arc but it is important in geodesy the reason why it differs from the normal to the geoid is because the geoid is an idealized theoretical shape at mean sea level points on the real surface of the earth are usually above or below this idealized geoid surface and here the true vertical can vary slightly also the true vertical at a point at a specific time is influenced by tidal forces which the theoretical geoid averages outastronomical latitude is not to be confused with declination the coordinate astronomers use in a similar way to specify the angular position of stars northsouth of the celestial equator see equatorial coordinates nor with ecliptic latitude the coordinate that astronomers use to specify the angular position of stars northsouth of the ecliptic see ecliptic coordinates
