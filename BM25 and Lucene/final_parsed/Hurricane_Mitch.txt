ninth hurricane and third major hurricane of the 1998 hurricane season along with hurricane georges mitch was the most notable hurricane in the season for its deaths and destruction at the time hurricane mitch was the strongest atlantic hurricane observed in the month of october though it has since been surpassed by hurricane wilma of the 2005 season in addition the hurricane is the seventh most intense atlantic hurricane on recordmitch formed in the western caribbean sea on october 22 1998 and after drifting through extremely favorable conditions it rapidly strengthened to peak at category5 status the highest possible rating on the saffirsimpson hurricane scale after drifting southwestward and weakening the hurricane hit honduras as a minimal hurricane it drifted through central america reformed in the bay of campeche and ultimately struck florida as a strong tropical stormdue to its slow motion from october 29 to november 3 hurricane mitch dropped historic amounts of rainfall in honduras guatemala and nicaragua with unofficial reports of up to 75 inches 1,900mm deaths due to catastrophic flooding made it the second deadliest atlantic hurricane in history after the great hurricane of 1780 nearly 11,000people were killed with over 11,000 left missing by the end of 1998 additionally roughly 2.7 million were left homeless as a result of the hurricane the flooding caused extreme damage estimated at over 6billion 1998 usdtropical depression thirteen formed on october22 over the southwestern caribbean sea from a tropical wave that exited africa on october10 it executed a small loop and while doing so intensified into tropical storm mitch a weakness in a ridge allowed the storm to track slowly to the north after becoming disorganized due to wind shear from an upper-level low mitch quickly intensified in response to favorable conditions including warm waters and good outflow it became a hurricane on october24 and developed an eye after turning to the west mitch rapidly intensified first into a major hurricane on october25 and then into a category 5 on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale the next dayat peak intensity mitch maintained maximum sustained winds of 180mph 285kmh while off the northern coast of honduras hurricane hunters reported a minimum barometric pressure of 905mbar 26.7inhg which at the time was the lowest in the month of october and tied for the fourth lowest for any atlantic hurricane initially the national hurricane center nhc and various tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated a turn to the north threatening the yucatn peninsula instead mitch turned to the south due to a ridge that was not observed while the storm was active land interaction imparted weakening and the hurricane made landfall on honduras on october29 with winds of 80mph 130kmh mitch slowly weakened while turning to the west over land maintaining deep convection over waters after moving across mountainous terrain in central america the surface circulation of mitch dissipated on november1 the next day the remnants reached the gulf of mexico which reorganized into a tropical storm on november3 mitch accelerated to the northeast ahead of a cold front moving across the yucatn peninsula before striking near naples florida on november5 shortly thereafter the storm became an extratropical cyclone which was tracked by the nhc until november9due to the threat the government of honduras evacuated some of the 45,000 citizens on the bay islands and prepared all air and naval resources the government of belize issued a purple alert and asked for citizens on offshore islands to leave for the mainland because the hurricane threatened to strike near belize city as a category4 hurricane much of the city was evacuated in fear of a repeat of hurricane hattie 37years earlier guatemala issued a purple alert as well recommending boats to stay in port telling people to prepare or seek shelter and warning of potential overflowing rivers by the time hurricane mitch made landfall numerous people were evacuated along the western caribbean coastline including 100,000 in honduras 10,000 in guatemala and 20,000 in the mexican state

were confirmed dead and almost as many reported missing deaths were mostly from flooding and mudslides in central america where the slow-moving hurricane and then tropical storm dropped nearly 36 inches 900mm of rain the flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed tens of thousands of homes with total damage amounting to over 5billion 1998usd 6billion 2006usd most of which was in honduras and nicaragua prior to mitch the deadliest hurricane in central america was hurricane fifi in 1974 which killed an estimated 8,00010,000while offshore northern honduras hurricane mitch passed over guanaja island high waves eroded northern coastlines and damaged lagoons most of the bay islands had damage to their water facilities two days of winds exceeding 200kmh 120mph destroyed nearly all of the plants and trees on guanaja uprooting or knocking down almost the entire mangrove forest it is estimated that the hurricane produced waves of 44ft 13m in heightwhile moving slowly for several days offshore honduras hurricane mitch drew moisture from the pacific ocean and the caribbean sea producing high amounts of rainfall of over 300mm 12in per day the highest official total was 928mm 36.5in at choluteca which represented more than half of the annual precipitation average at the same location 466.7mm 18.37in fell in a 24-hour period on october31 which was more than double of the previous record set in 1985 there were unofficial rainfall totals in central america as high as 1,900mm 75in rain gauges in mountainous areas were washed away the high rainfall caused many rivers in the country to overflow to an unprecedented extent this century as described by the united nations the rainfall collected in rivers causing extensive river flooding across the country the greatest depth recorded was 12.5m 41ft on the ula river near chinda whilst the greatest width recorded was 359m 1,178ft on the ro lean near arizona the rainfall also caused widespread mudslides across the mountainous country in the countrys interior particularly the southern portion the high rainfall caused hundreds of landslides many of them shallow and about 95% in the form of debris flow however two earthflows caused significant damage near tegucigalpahurricane mitch wrought significant damage to honduras affecting nearly the entire population and causing damage in all 18 departments the united nations economic commission for latin america and the caribbean estimated that mitch caused the worst floods of the 20th century in the country an estimated 7080% of transportation network was

it will never again be used for an atlantic hurricane the name was replaced with matthew in the 2004 season which was itself retired after the 2016 seasonafter the disaster caused by hurricane mitch countries around the world donated significant aid totaling 6.3billion 1998usd throughout central america which was recovering from an economic crisis that occurred in 1996 many wished to continue the growth of the infrastructure and economy in addition after witnessing the vulnerability to hurricanes the affected governments endeavored to prevent such a disaster from occurring againhundreds of thousands of people lost their homes but many took this as an opportunity to rebuild stronger houses with a new structurally improved foundation homes were redesigned to be able to withstand another hurricane however lack of arable crop land took away the jobs from many decreasing an already low income even lowerfollowing the passage of mitch disease outbreaks occurred throughout central america including cholera leptospirosis and dengue fever over 2,328 cases of cholera were reported killing 34people guatemala was most affected by the bacterium where most of the deaths occurred from contaminated food 450 cases of leptospirosis were reported in nicaragua killing seven people there were over 1,357 cases of dengue reported though no deaths were reported from the diseasewhile stalling over the western caribbean sea mitchs strong winds produced strong waves damaging local coral reefs later the storms immense rainfall led to runoff polluted with debris and fresh water this resulted in diseases occurring within the coral however the hurricanes upwelling cooled the warm water temperatures preventing significant bleaching and destruction of the coral reefmitch caused such massive and widespread damage that honduran president carlos roberto flores claimed it destroyed fifty years of progress in the country honduras the country most affected by the hurricane received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane mexico quickly gave help sending 700tons of food 11tons of medicine four rescue planes rescue personnel and trained search dogs cuba also volunteered sending a contingent of physicians to the country the us administration offered at first troops stationed in honduras and then withdrew them a few days after the storm they also at first offered only 2million 1998usd in aid which came as a shock to residents and president carlos roberto flores alike the us later increased their offer to 70million 1998usd the honduran government distributed food water and medical services to the hurricane victims including the more than 4million without water in addition the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate largely due to the destruction of crop lands however rebuilding provided jobs in the following years in costa rica reconstruction after the hurricane increased the number of jobs by 5.9% lowering the unemployment rate slightly media related to hurricane mitch at wikimedia commons
