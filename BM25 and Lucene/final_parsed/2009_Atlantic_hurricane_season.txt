2009 atlantic hurricane season  wikipedia the 2009 atlantic hurricane season was a below-average atlantic hurricane season that produced eleven tropical cyclones nine named storms three hurricanes and two major hurricanes it officially began on june1 and ended on november30 dates that conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the atlantic basin the seasons first tropical cyclone tropical depression one developed on may28 while the final storm hurricane ida dissipated on november10 the most intense hurricane bill was a powerful cape verde-type hurricane that affected areas from the leeward islands to newfoundland the season featured the lowest number of tropical cyclones since the 1997 season and only one system claudette made landfall in the united states forming from the interaction of a tropical wave and an upper level low claudette made landfall on the florida panhandle with maximum sustained winds of 45mph 75kmh before quickly dissipating over alabama the storm killed two people and caused 228,000 2009 usd in damagepre-season forecasts issued by colorado state university csu called for fourteen named storms and seven hurricanes of which three were expected to attain major hurricane status the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa later issued its initial forecast which predicted nine to fourteen named storms four to seven hurricanes and one to three major hurricanes after several revisions in the projected number of named storms both agencies lowered their forecasts by the middle of the seasonseveral storms made landfall or directly affected land outside of the united states tropical storm ana brought substantial rainfall totals to many of the caribbean islands including puerto rico which led to minor street flooding hurricane bill delivered gusty winds and rain to the island of newfoundland while tropical storm danny affected the us state of north carolina and erika affected the lesser antilles as a poorly organized tropical system hurricane fred affected the cape verde islands as a developing tropical cyclone and tropical storm grace briefly impacted the azores becoming the farthest northeast forming storm on record the seasons final storm ida affected portions of central america before bringing significant rainfall to the southeast united states as an extratropical cycloneforecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts philip j klotzbach william m gray and their associates at colorado state university and separately by noaa forecastersklotzbachs team formerly led by gray defined the average number of storms per season 1950 to 2000 as 9.6tropical storms 5.9hurricanes 2.3major hurricanes storms reaching at least category3 strength in the saffirsimpson hurricane scale and ace index 96.1 noaa defines a season as above-normal near-normal or below-normal by a combination of the number of named storms the number reaching hurricane strength the number reaching major hurricane strength and ace indexon december10 2008 klotzbachs team issued its first extended-range forecast for the 2009season predicting above-average activity 14named storms 7hurricanes 3of category3 or higher and ace index of 125 on april7 2009 klotzbachs team issued an updated forecast for the 2009season predicting near-average activity 12named storms 6hurricanes 2of category3 or higher and ace index of 100 citing the possible cause as the high probability of a weak el nio forming during the season on may21 2009 noaa issued their forecast for the season predicting near or slightly above average activity 9 to 14named storms 4 to 7hurricanes and 1 to 3of category3 or higheron june2 2009 klotzbachs team issued another updated forecast for the 2009 season predicting slightly below average activity 11 named storms 5hurricanes 2 of category3 or higher and ace index of 85 also on june2 2009 the florida state university center for ocean-atmospheric prediction studies fsu coaps issued its first ever atlantic hurricane season forecast the fsu coaps forecast predicted 8 named storms including 4 hurricanes and an ace index of 65 on june18 2009 the uk met office ukmo issued a forecast of 6tropical storms in the july to november period with a 70% chance that the number would be in the range3 to 9 they also predicted an ace index of 60 with a 70%chance that the index would be in the range40 to 80 on august4 2009 klotzbachs team updated their forecast for the 2009 season again predicting slightly below average activity 10 named storms 4hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes on august6 2009 the noaa also updated their forecast for the 2009 season predicting below average activity 711 named storms 36 hurricanes and 12 major hurricanesduring the 2009 season nine of the eleven tropical cyclones affected land of which five actually made landfall the united states experienced one of its quietest years with no hurricanes making landfall in the country throughout the basin six people were killed in tropical cyclone-related incidents and total losses reached roughly 77million most of the damage resulted from hurricane bill which caused severe beach erosion throughout the east coast of the united states in the united states tropical cyclones killed six people and caused roughly 50million in damage in the lesser antilles tropical storms ana and erika brought moderate rainfall to several islands but resulted in little damage elsewhere in the atlantic the azores islands atlantic canada bermuda cape verde islands and wales were affected by tropical cyclones or their remnants in canada hurricane bill produced widespread moderate rainfall in nova scotia and newfoundland leaving roughly 10million in losses the hurricane also produced tropical storm-force winds in bermuda hurricane fred briefly impacted the southern cape verde islands as it bypassed the islands early in its existence the azores and wales were also affected by tropical storm grace however both areas recorded only minor effectsoverall the seasons activity was reflected with a low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ace rating of 53 the lowest since 1997 due to the low number of storms in the 2009 season many of which were short-lived the overall ace value was ranked as below-average totaling under 66 hurricane bill was responsible for the ace value for august being 30% above average ace is broadly speaking a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed so storms that last a long time as well as particularly strong hurricanes have high aces ace is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots 39mph 63kmh or tropical storm strength subtropical cyclones are excluded from the totalduring mid-may a frontal boundary stalled near the bahamas and slowly degenerated on may25 2009 an area of low pressure developed along the tail-end of a decaying cold front near the northern bahamas tracking northward this low gradually developed as it moved within 85mi 140km of north carolinas outer banks by may28 deep convection developed across a small area over the low pressure system leading to the national hurricane center classifying the system as tropical depression one the depression moved over the warm waters of the gulf stream for the following 24hours allowing it to maintain its convection before moving into a hostile environment characterized by strong wind shear and cooler waters late on may29 the system degenerated into a remnant low several hours later on may30 about 345mi 555km south-southeast of halifax nova scotia tropical depression one was absorbed by a warm frontas a tropical cyclone the depression had no impact on land however the precursor to the system brought scattered rainfall and increased winds to parts of the north carolina coastline but no damage upon becoming a tropical depression on may28 tropical depression one became the northernmost forming may tropical cyclone in atlantic history though subtropical cyclones formed equally far north in 1972 and 2007 it also marked the third consecutive year with pre-season tropical or subtropical cyclones in the basinana formed out of an area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave on august11 ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on august12 before weakening back to a depression the following day the system degenerated into a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward on august14 the depression regenerated roughly 1,075mi 1,735km east of the leeward islands early on august15 the storm re-attained tropical storm status at which time it was named ana after reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40mph 65kmh and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar hpa 29.65inhg the storm began to weaken again due to increasing wind shear and the unusually fast movement of ana in post-storm analysis it was discovered that ana had degenerated into a tropical wave once more on august16 before reaching any landmassesnumerous tropical storm watches were issued for the lesser antilles puerto rico and the dominican republic between august15 and 17 several islands took minor precautions for the storm including st croix which evacuated 40residents from flood-prone areas ahead of the storm in the dominican republic officials took preparations by setting up relief agencies and setting up shelters impact from ana was minimal mainly consisting of light to moderate rainfall in puerto rico up to 2.76in 70mm causing street flooding and forcing the evacuation of three schools high winds associated with the storm also downed trees and power lines leaving roughly 6,000 residents without poweras ana regenerated into a tropical depression a new tropical depression developed early on august15 southwest of the cape verde islands light wind shear and warm waters allowed the depression to steadily intensify becoming tropical storm bill later that day by august17 bill attained hurricane-status about midway between the cape verde islands and the lesser antilles eventually the hurricane attained its peak intensity as a category4 storm roughly 345mi 555km east-northeast of the leeward islands the storm attained maximum winds of 130mph 215kmh the highest of any storm during the season before weakening slightly as it turned north the large storm passed roughly 175mi 280km west of bermuda as a category2 hurricane further weakening took place as bill brushed the southern coast of nova scotia the following day shortly before making landfall in newfoundland bill weakened to a tropical storm and accelerated the storm eventually transitioned into an extratropical cyclone after moving over the north atlantic before being absorbed by a larger non-tropical low on august24two people were killed by the storms large swellsone in maine and another in florida the hurricane came close enough to warrant tropical cyclone watches and warnings in both the us and canada bill was one of three tropical storms active on august16 large life-threatening swells produced by the storm impacted north-facing coastlines of puerto rico and hispaniola as hurricane bill approached bermuda along the coasts of north carolina waves averaging 10ft 3.0m in height impacted beaches on long island beach damage was severe in some areas the damage was worse than hurricane gloria in 1985 in new york severe beach erosion caused by the storm resulted in over 35.5million in lossesjust one day after the formation of hurricane bill the seasons third named storm developed on august16 forming out of a tropical wave and an upper-level low pressure system claudette quickly intensified into a tropical storm offshore south of tallahassee florida by the afternoon the storm had attained winds of 60mph 95kmh and steadily tracked towards the florida panhandle early on august17 the center of claudette made landfall on santa rosa island several hours after landfall the storm weakened to a tropical depression and the hydrometeorological prediction center took over primary responsibility of the storm the system quickly dissipated and was last noted over alabama on august18the national hurricane center issued tropical storm warnings for the florida coastline and residents in some counties were advised to evacuate storm-surge-prone areas tropical storm claudette produced moderate rainfall across portions of florida georgia and alabama between august16 and 18 two people were killed offshore amidst rough seas from the storm an ef-0 tornado spawned by the storm in cape coral damaged 11 homes leaving 103,000 in damages additional damages to coastal property and beaches amounted to 125,000 as a result of claudettearound the same time the remnants of hurricane bill dissipated over the northern atlantic a new tropical storm developed near the bahamas on august26 the system immediately declared tropical storm danny on its first advisory erratically moved in a general northwestward direction danny attained peak winds of 60mph 95kmh before succumbing to high wind shear after turning northward the storm weakened and was eventually absorbed by another low pressure system off the east coast of the united states early on august29 high waves from danny killed a boy in the outer bankson september1 the seasons fifth named storm tropical storm erika formed east of the lesser antilles upon forming the storm had attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph 85kmh persistent wind shear prevented the system from intensifying and resulted in the storms convection being completely displaced from the center of circulation by the time it passed over guadeloupe on september2 after entering the caribbean sea erika briefly regained strength before fully succumbing to strong shear the system eventually dissipated on september4 to the south of puerto rico damages were minor though one island received several inches of rainseveral days after erika dissipated a new tropical depression formed southeast of the cape verde islands on september7 this depression rapidly intensified within an environment of low wind shear and high sea surface temperatures receiving the name fred on september8 the storm quickly developed an eye feature and was upgraded to a hurricane roughly 24hours after being named within a 12hour span the storms winds increased by 40mph 65kmh to its peak of 120mph 195kmh upon reaching this intensity fred became the strongest storm on record south of 30n and east of 35w in the atlantic basin not long after the intensification ceased it began to weaken as dry air became entrained within the system by september11 the storm nearly stalled northwest of the cape verde islands and weakened to a tropical storm the following day fred degenerated into a remnant low before taking a westward track across the atlantic the remnants of fred persisted for nearly a week nearly regenerating into a tropical depression several times the low eventually dissipated on september19 to the south of bermudain late september a new well-defined tropical wave moved off the west coast of africa into the atlantic ocean by september25 the system had developed sufficient deep convection for the nhc to classify it as tropical depression eight at this time the depression attained its peak intensity with winds of 35mph 55kmh and a minimum pressure of 1008mbar hpa shortly thereafter wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures caused the depression to weaken the system degenerated into a remnant low on september26 before degenerating into a trough of low pressureoriginating from an extratropical cyclone east of newfoundland on september27 the precursor to tropical storm grace tracked southeastward towards the azores gaining subtropical characteristics after executing a counterclockwise loop between october1 and 3 deep convection wrapped around a small circulation center that had developed within the larger cyclone on october4 this smaller low developed into a tropical storm while situated near the azores islands becoming the northeastern-most forming atlantic tropical cyclone on record the storm quickly turned northeastward and intensified developing an eye-like feature as it attained peak winds of 65mph 100kmh and a minimum pressure of 986mbar hpa 29.11inhg it weakened over increasingly colder waters and began merging with an approaching frontal boundary early on october6 grace transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating later that day near walesalthough grace passed through the azores islands the storm had little known effects there in europe the system and its remnants brought rain to several countries including portugal the united kingdom and belgium no fatalities were linked to grace and overall damage was minimala tropical wave left the coast of africa on october1 moving westward with intermittent showers and thunderstorms on october 5 the system became better organized and a low-pressure area formed although the thunderstorms were displaced east of the center of circulation and the probability for development was never high the disturbance became a tropical depression around 0000 utc on october 6 about 775mi 1,247km east of the lesser antilles operationally the storm was not designated a tropical cyclone until later on october6 when it was immediately declared a tropical stormaffected by strong wind shear henri remained disorganized with its center located on the western edge of the convection moving northwestward henri intensified slightly to peak winds of 50mph 85kmh on october7 after the convection increased shortly thereafter the wind shear grew stronger and on october8 the storm weakened to a tropical depression the structure became further disorganized with several low-level vortices just twelve hours after weakening into a depression henri degenerated into a remnant area of low pressure the remnants continued northwestward before turning to the west-southwest due to a ridge on october11 the storms circulation dissipated near hispaniola having never impacted landthe final storm of the 2009 season formed over the southern caribbean sea on november4 the slow moving system quickly developed into tropical storm ida within a favorable environment as it neared the coastline of nicaragua several hours before moving over land ida attained hurricane-status with winds reaching 80mph 130kmh hours after moving inland ida weakened to a tropical storm and further to a tropical depression as it turned northward on november7 the depression re-entered the caribbean sea and quickly intensified early on november8 the system re-attained hurricane intensity as it rapidly intensified over warm waters ida attained its peak intensity as a category2 hurricane early the next day with winds of 105mph 165kmh as it moved over the yucatn channel not long after reaching this intensity ida quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it entered the gulf of mexico despite strong wind shear the storm briefly re-attained hurricane status for a third time near the southeastern louisiana coastline before quickly weakening to a tropical storm shortly before moving inland over the southern united states ida transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the remnants of ida persisted until november11 at which time the low dissipated remnant energy from ida provided energy for another system which became a powerful noreaster causing significant damage in the mid-atlantic states the resulting storm came to be known as noridain the southern caribbean hurricane ida caused roughly 2.1million in damage in nicaragua after destroying numerous homes and leaving an estimated 40,000 people homeless ida also produced significant rainfall across portions of western cuba with some areas recording up to 12.5in 320mm of rain during the storms passage in the united states the hurricane and the subsequent noreaster caused substantial damage mainly in the mid-atlantic states one person was killed by ida after drowning in rough seas while six others were killed in various incidents related to the noreaster overall the two systems caused nearly 300million in damage throughout the countrythe following names were used for named storms in the north atlantic in 2009 names that were not used are marked in  this is the same list used in the 2003 season with the exception of fred ida and joaquin which replaced fabian isabel and juan respectively the names fred and ida were used for atlantic storms for the first time in 2009 as the name joaquin was not used during the course of this season there were no names retired this year thus the same list was used again in the 2015 seasonthis is a table of all of the storms that formed in the 2009 atlantic hurricane season it includes their duration names landfalls  denoted by bold location names  damages and death totals deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident but were still related to that storm damage and deaths include totals while the
