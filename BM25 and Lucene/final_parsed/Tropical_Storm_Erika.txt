tropical storm erika  wikipedia tropical storm erika of august 2015 was the deadliest natural disaster in dominica since hurricane david in 1979 the fifth named storm of the season erika developed from a westward-moving tropical wave while well east of the lesser antilles hostile conditions including dry air and wind shear inhibited significant development and erika failed to acquire sustained winds beyond 50mph 85kmh contrary to predictions of a northwesterly recurvature the cyclone persisted on a westerly course and passed through the leeward islands and emerged over the caribbean sea on august27 erika succumbed to adverse conditions the following day dissipating as a tropical cyclone near the dominican republic the remnant system persisted for several more days ultimately moving across the gulf of mexico before dissipating over georgia on september2several islands experienced heavy rainfall during the passage of erika especially dominica the storms asymmetric structure coupled with the mountainous terrain of the island and ample moisture aloft led to rainfall accumulations up to 33in 850mm with grounds already saturated from antecedent rains tremendous runoff quickly overwhelmed river basins and triggered catastrophic floods accompanying mudslides worsened the situation temporarily damming the rivers before collapsing hundreds of homes were left uninhabitable and thousands of people were displaced the entire town of petite savanne was evacuated and subsequently abandoned as a result of the storm all told 30people died across the island in the nations worst disaster since hurricane david the storms devastating effects in dominica prompted an influx of international assistance aid from multiple nations and intergovernmental organizations poured in to assist victims of the storm thousands of homes needed to be built or repaired including 5001,000 for the relocation of all of petite savannes residentsin guadeloupe heavy rainfall in the vicinity of basse-terre caused flooding and mudslides forcing roads to temporarily close approximately 250,000people in puerto rico were left without electricity the island experienced us17.37million in agricultural damage in the dominican republic a weather station in barahona measured 24.26in 616mm of rain including 8.8in 220mm in a single hour about 823homes suffered damage and 7,345 people were displaced five people died in haiti four from a weather-related traffic accident and one from a landslide total damage from erika is estimated to be over us500million with us482.8million in dominica alone owing to the disastrous effects on dominica the name erika was retired in the spring of 2016 and will never again be used for an atlantic tropical cyclone it will be replaced with elsa for the 2021 atlantic hurricane seasonon august20 2015 the national hurricane center nhc began monitoring a tropical wave over western africa near the atlantic shore the disorganized system emerged over the atlantic ocean several hundred miles southeast of the cape verde islands the following day moving quickly west the system bypassed the cape verde islands to the south on august22 but remained largely disorganized a sharp trough developed within expanding deep convection on august23 though a well-defined circulation did not consolidate organization of the low improved throughout the day as environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis the trough acquired gale-force winds the following day and finally developed a closed circulation by 18:00utc the formation of a closed low marked the transition into a tropical cyclone accordingly the system was classified as tropical storm erika the fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season upon its designation erika was situated roughly 1,035mi 1,665km east of the lesser antilles the storm maintained a brisk westward trajectory steered by a subtropical ridge to the northat the time of erikas classification forecast models diverged significantly on the potential future of erika statistical guidance and the hwrf depicted a hurricane while the ecmwf and gfs showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear the models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course accordingly the nhc noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for erika this uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones but roughly average for weak poorly organized systems throughout august25 and into early august26 the convective organization of erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment of dry air periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection early on august27 erika managed to intensify slightly attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 50mph 85kmh and a barometric pressure of 1001mbar hpa 29.56inhg around 09:00utc the disorganized center of erika passed over the northern tip of guadeloupe before emerging over the eastern caribbean seaconvection remained poorly organized and mostly confined to eastern portions of the cyclone as it traversed the eastern caribbean sea multiple circulation centers were noted during the overnight of august2728 all rotating around a broad general center one such center moved over st croix and produced gale-force gusts environmental conditions ahead of the storm became increasingly hostile and forecasters at the nhc continued to note unusually high uncertainty in their forecasts further structural degradation ensued on august28 as erika approached the dominican republic based on data from hurricane hunters erika degenerated into a broad area of low pressureno longer meeting the definition of a tropical cycloneshortly after 12:00utc near the southeastern coast of the dominican republic operationally the nhc maintained advisories on erika until 13:30utc on august29 it was also noted during those advisories that the center was completely devoid of convection and whatever convection remained was reduced to the eastern half of the systemaround 21:00utc on august28 the remnants of erika made landfall along the southeastern coast of the dominican republic the disheveled system emerged over the windward passage early on august29 thereafter the system skirted the northern coast of cuba and entered the gulf of mexico on august31 turning northward the disturbance eventually crossed northern florida on september2 before dissipating over georgia the following dayvarious local governments issued tropical storm watches and warnings for their respective nations throughout the duration of erika watches and warnings covered the lesser antilles from guadeloupe northward almost the entirety of the greater antilles and the bahamas the red cross opened four shelters to the public across the united states virgin islands the local health department also opened special needs shelters on st croix and st thomas all non-essential government personnel were given administrative leave on august27 owing to rough seas local ports temporarily closed although airports remained open several airlines cancelled flights a territory-wide curfew was imposed until the afternoon of august28schools ports and beaches were closed across the dominican republic the army of the dominican republic deployed 275soldiers and alongside the nations air force assisted with the evacuation of residents the navy was placed on standby for potential search and rescue operations officials in haiti suspended air service banned highway travel between departments and ordered small watercraft to remain at port evacuation shelters were opened across all departments and 254prisoners were relocated from gonaves to three other facilitieson august28 florida governor rick scott declared a state of emergency despite the storm dissipating shortly thereafter scott kept the emergency declaration in place and stated this storm has been completely unpredictable the whole timewe will still get a lot of rain and a lot of flooding thirty members of the florida national guard were positioned while another 8,000 were placed on standby a collective 17flights were cancelled at miami international airport and fort lauderdalehollywood international airport on august28 schools in hendry county preemptively closed for august31 with officials citing flooding concerns sandbags were distributed to residents in doral hallandale beach hollywood and sweetwater the last hurricane to impact the state was hurricane wilma in 2005 since that time the states population grew by 2million with many presumed to have never experienced a hurricane before some newer residents remained apathetic over the storm dismissing it as another excuse to skip work or school or to partyin guadeloupe where erika made landfall rains reached 100mm 3.9in in basse-terre while gusts peaked at 100kmh 62mph on la dsirade some landslides and flooding were reported with roads in basse-terre temporarily closed lectricit de france reported that 1,600customers lost power during the storm rough seas in martinique grounded boats landslides and felled trees blocked several roadways across the island elsewhere in the lesser antilles effects from erika were negligiblethe outer bands of erika brought much needed rain drought-stricken puerto rico a station in adjuntas recorded 4.45in 113mm of rain tropical storm-force wind gusts peaking at 59mph 95kmh in maricao caused substantial disruption to the power grid leaving approximately 250,000people without electricity thirty-six homes sustained roof damage across interior locations of the territory and agriculture sustained us17.37million in damagea weather station in barahona dominican republic measured 24.26in 616mm of rain during erikas passage including 8.8in 220mm in a single hour surrounding areas reported significantly less rain however throughout the country 823homes suffered damage and 7,345people were displaced erika blocked over 400 roads and left many power outages winds gusts of 50mph 85kmh in azua caused at least 400million dop us8.88million in damage to the banana crop heavy rains also impacted haiti which was still recovering from a catastrophic earthquake in 2010 an estimated 60,000people remained in emergency housing four persons died and eleven others were hospitalized in logne when a truck crashed into a bus on rain-slicked roads and exploded a fifth death occurred during a landslide in port-au-prince two people in the area were injured after a house collapsedthe remnants of erika later brought much needed rains to cuba which was suffering from its worst drought since 1901later erikas remnants dropped locally heavy rainfall across florida particularly in the miami metropolitan area a station northwest of sweetwater observed 9in 230mm of rain minor flash flooding left streets in wynwood impassable farther north in flagler county scattered thunderstorms produced isolated instances of heavy rain 2.2in 56mm fell within one hour in palm coast in the greater jacksonville area lightning struck the sally b mathis elementary school resulting in damage to the air conditioning unit and evacuation of students in neighboring georgia moisture from erikas remnants fueled scattered severe thunderstorms large hail caused us2.3million in damage near woodstock strong winds gusting up to 60mph 95kmh accompanied these storms downing trees and power lines in cherokee polk and troup counties additional rainfall extended north through the carolinasalthough erika passed to the north of dominica as a weak tropical storm torrential rains associated with the storm impacted the country unusually high precipitable water values of 2.6in 67mm were present over the island as erika moved through orographic influence exacerbated rainfall rates and this was further compounded with the formation of a temporary mesoscale low over the island as the primary circulation of erika continued west more than 8in 200mm of rain fell across the entire island in less than 48hours with an island-wide average of 24in 610mm during the period of heaviest rain average rainfall across the entire island exceeded 3.5in 90mm per hour rates along the macoucherie river reached 11in 270mm per hour the heaviest rain was concentrated around the nations tallest mountain morne diablotins where an estimated 31 to 33in 800 to 850mm fell rainfall across morne diablotin national park generally exceeded 24in 600mm a secondary peak accumulation of 26 to 28in 650 to 700mm occurred in the southeastern part of the island around morne trois pitons observed accumulations include 17in 430mm at gleau gommier 12.62in 321mm at canefield airport and 8.74in 222mm at douglascharles airport with grounds already saturated from nearly two weeks of rain prior to erika much of the precipitation did not penetrate the surface in multiple watersheds runoff exceeded 60percent of accumulationscatastrophic flash flooding and mudslides ensued across the island resulting in dominicas worst natural disaster since hurricane david in 1979 across the islands rugged terrain the mudslides temporarily dammed overflowing rivers creating a buildup of water these earthen dams subsequently collapsed leading to amplified flooding downstream flow rates in these localized events vastly exceeded values expected by international commission on large dams modeling a post-storm study of 16rivers on the island revealed peak discharge values in excess of 1,000ms along 5 rivers with a maximum of 2,876ms along the malabuka rivernearly 17,000 of the nations 71,293people were severely impacted by the storm a total of 30people were killed 20others were injured and 574people were left homeless more than 890homes were destroyed or rendered uninhabitable infrastructure suffered tremendous damage 6percent of bridges and 17percent of roads were wiped out furthermore half of the nations bridges and a quarter of its roads were damaged total losses amounted to ec1.3billion us482.8million roughly 90percent of dominicas gross domestic product dominica prime minister roosevelt skerrit stated in a national announcement on august28 that the visual damage i saw today i fear may have set our development process back by 20 yearsflooding crippled transportation and communication with eight bridges severely damaged or destroyed leaving many areas of the island isolated boetica and delices remained cut-off by ground for more than three weeks more than 12major rivers topped their banks approximately 45percent of residents lost electricity and almost the entirety of the water supply network was damaged additionally 50percent of telephone service was lost both canefield and douglascharles airports were flooded with water rising above a small airplane at the latter douglascharles airport sustained more than ec39.5million us14.6million in damage and was closed until september18 the main river running through roseau the nations capital burst its banks during the overnight of august2627 flooding surrounding areas one person was killed during a mudslide and one building collapsed in the citythe small community of petite savanne was virtually destroyed with 217homes leveled and all residents forced to evacuate twenty people died or were presumed dead in the village accounting for two-thirds of the deaths attributed to erika in dominica residents dug through mud and debris often with their bare hands to rescue those trapped and in many cases did so with nearby homes on the verge of collapse the village was isolated for several days and residents buried victims before help arrivedimmediately following erikas devastating impact in dominica on august27 the organisation of eastern caribbean states convened to determine an assessment plan the government of dominica declared nine areas special disaster areas petite savanne pichelin good hope bath estate dubique campbell coulibistrie san sauveur and petite soufriere the national emergency operations centre was activated and worked in conjunction with various local agencies to conduct relief missions approximately 100personnel were deployed for various relief measures including search and rescue the dominica spa health and wellness association worked in conjunction with the trinidad-based centre for human development to provide psychological support to victims eight trauma specialists were sent to dominicathe psychiatric unit of princess margaret hospital conducted field assessments and provided emotional support to residents in a report on september18 they noted that residents in coulibistrie remained in a state of shock for weeks after erika with many struggling to begin the recovery process the ministry of health highlighted concerns over post-storm diseases particularly from mosquitoes due to a major increase in the usage of water storage containers an outbreak of gastroenteritis ensued in the weeks following erika with 153cases confirmed by september22 cases were primarily in portsmouth saint joseph and roseaua unique means of supplying food and water the communities of boetica and delices only accessible by air due to a gorge 260ft 80m wide and 200ft 61m deep was established in the form of a zip-line in late-september this served as the primary means of aid until a 98ft 30m bailey bridge was constructed by april2016 the cost of infrastructure rehabilitation projects reached ec7million us3million

response to erikathe destruction of petite savanne forced the evacuation of 823people the village was later deemed uninhabitable and a new town needed to be built elsewhere many were temporarily relocated to the dominica grammar school in roseau however members of the public looked upon the evacuees with scorn and insulted them for disrupting their daily lives parliamentary representative kenneth darroux pleaded with residents to be understanding and patient with those whom were displaced plans for a new settlement were established in february2016 with plans to build 5001,000homes
