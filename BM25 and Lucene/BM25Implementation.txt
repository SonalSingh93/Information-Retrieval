\f0\fs24 \cf0 BM25 implementation\
\
The given implementation of BM25 ranking algorithm performs term at a time evaluation for the queries present in the file.\
\
It reads the queries from the file along with the given query Id and stores it in a dictionary.\
\
It uses the unigram index generated in the previous assignment to fetch the matching documents.\
\
It then calculates BM25 scores for each document that contains the given terms(one or all) : then adds up the scores for \
each term for a given document to get the final document score for the matching documents.\
\
The relevance information is not present so it substitues r and R as 0.\
\
It then sorts the results in descending order to get the op ranked documents and prints the top 100 results and also writes\
the results onto a file in the format specified in the problem statement.\
